0,Why Airline Stocks Are Climbing Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Airline Stocks Are Climbing Today. The early stages of a recovery are beginning to take shape, and Wall Street","   Airline shares took flight Monday after another weekend of positive data points suggesting travel demand is slowly returning and a positive write-up of the industry in Barron's. Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), one of the focuses of the Barron's article, gained 10% as of 11 a.m., leading the way among airlines. But the whole sector had momentum on Monday. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) all traded up about 5%. The airlines were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has cut global travel demand to near zero. Airline stocks lost half their value or more in March and early April but have since stabilized thanks to government assistance as part of the CARES Act stimulus plan and private fundraising efforts. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The airlines are stable, but with traffic still down 90% or more year over year, the industry remains vulnerable. Companies are going to need passenger demand to return so they don't run out of cash in the months to come. The weekend provided fresh evidence we are bouncing off the lows in terms of travel interest. About 620,000 travelers passed through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints on May 30 and 31. That's down dramatically compared to the 4.6 million travelers screened during the same two calendar days a year prior but nearly triple the number of passengers screened the first weekend in April. If nothing else, the trend is moving in the right direction, and it suggests that a Memorial Day uptick was not a one-off holiday weekend phenomenon but instead a real sign of travel slowly beginning to normalize. Barron's has noticed too, writing over the weekend that airlines have done a good job bolstering their balance sheets, adopting distancing guidelines, and reassuring customers by deep-cleaning planes. Domestic travel is expected to return first, and the widely read financial weekly highlights Southwest, Spirit, and Delta as stocks that look particularly interesting. We seem to be heading in the right direction, but investors need to remember we still have a long way to go. It will likely take years until travel volumes return to prepandemic levels, and it's possible some of the more lucrative parts of the business, including corporate business travel and international flying, will never be the same.","Jun 1, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/01/why-airline-stocks-are-climbing-today.aspx

4,Did Warren Buffett Make a Massive Mistake Selling His Airline Stocks?,. . . . . . . . Did Warren Buffett Make a Massive Mistake Selling His Airline Stocks?. Why,"      Adam Othman | June 2, 2020 | More on: AC It was a major surprise for many people when Warren Buffett announced that Berkshire Hathaway sold all its holdings in airline stocks. A few months ago, the pandemic started to wreak havoc on global economies and led to a shutdown. Warren Buffett previously did not want to sell his airline stocks. However, in the space of a few months, the situation has entirely changed. With millions of people infected by the novel coronavirus, crippling economies, air travel has also come to a grinding halt. Warren Buffett is the king when it comes to picking out stocks that pose potentially immense long-term profits for his investment portfolio. However, he said that the world has changed for the airline industry due to the pandemic. Buffett said that he was not sure what the future holds for the industry, and he does not know whether people will change their habits due to the lengthy lockdown. Uncertainty is the one thing that is for certain amid the global health crisis. It is also the uncertainty that is a crucial reason for Buffett to consider this stance on airline stocks and why he decided to cut his losses. Nobody knows when airlines can resume normal operations — not the airlines or the people who might want to travel. Air Canada (TSX:AC) recently released its quarterly earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Everybody was expecting bad news, and it came as a significant loss of over $1 billion for the Canadian airline. AC said that it expects that it can take at least three years for air traffic levels to get to pre-pandemic levels. That can only happen after the coronavirus subsides. It is impossible to give a realistic prediction since we are in entirely uncharted territory because of COVID-19. The CEO of AC, Calin Rovinescu, said that we are living through the “darkest period ever in the history of commercial aviation…” At writing, Air Canada has lost just over 69% of its share price from its 2020 peak. Trading for only $16 per share, the national carrier is close to its 52-week low. The airline’s debt has shot up to a devastating $9 billion after its quarterly report. Despite all the bad news, Air Canada has substantial liquidity through $6.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.

Southwest’s Difficult Decade One underperformer of the last decade was U.S. airline Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV). The big news of the past decade for Southwest was its $3.2 billion acquisition of AirTran Airways. The merger was announced in September 2010 and added 25 additional destinations to Southwest’s routes, including AirTran hub Atlanta, Georgia. The deal was ultimately approved by shareholders and regulators, and Southwest closed the deal on May 2, 2011. Southwest shares started the 2010s trading at around $11.18 but hit their decade low of $6.65 by late 2011. Southwest shares went on a tear in 2013 and 2014, eventually peaking at $48.99 in late 2015. The rally resumed in late 2016 when Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

That momentum ultimately pushed the stock to its all-time high of $65.12 at the very end of 2017. 2020 And Beyond From early 2017 to early 2020, Southwest shares traded mostly sideways in a range between $45 and $65 before the bottom fell out during the COVID-19 outbreak. In March, Southwest traded to a more than five-year low of $22.47 before bouncing back to around $34 today. Despite the bid 2020 hit, investors have still made decent returns in the popular airline stock over the past decade. In fact, $1,000 worth of Southwest stock in 2010 would be worth $2,940 today, assuming reinvested dividends. Looking ahead, analysts expect even more gains for Southwest in 2020.

6,JBLU Stock Might Be the Best Bet on Air Travel Recovery | InvestorPlace,JetBlue Stock Might Be the Best Bet on Air Travel Recovery. JBLU stock is likely to survive and even do," So far in 2020, airline stocks, including JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), have been pummelled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-term shareholders have had to sit tight as JBLU stock has gone down over 40%. It is now hovering around $10.5.  Now as our economy opens up and recovery hopes outweigh virus worries, investors are wondering if June would be a good month to invest in JetBlue shares. It is important for investors to appreciate that travel demand may not return to pre-coronavirus levels for several years, and I expect the domestic competitive landscape in the industry to evolve in the coming quarters. Yet JetBlue management will likely be able to capitalize on various opportunities offered by such changes and possibilities. Therefore, if you are an investor with a 2-3 year time horizon, you may consider buying the dips. JBLU stock price would become especially attractive if it falls toward or even below $9.5. In an average year, New York state-based JetBLue Airways carries over 42 million customers a year to more than 100 cities in the U.S., Caribbean, and Latin America. Before the coronavirus lockdown, it had an around 1,000 daily flights. Needless to say, since March, the reality is rather different. On May 7, the group reported its results for the first quarter 2020. Adjusted loss per share was 42 cents. A year ago, adjusted diluted earnings per share had been 16 cents. This was a wider-than-expected loss. Revenue was $1.59 billion, or a decline of 15.1% YoY. Analysts were expecting revenue of 1.7 billion. Due to the lockdown, the airline saw a 52% decline in March revenue. Otherwise, it had had a rather solid start to the year-earlier in January and February. Another metric airline analysts pay attention to is “Revenue passenger miles.” This measure of traffic declined by more than 18% YoY. In the second half of March, its daily cash burn had been around $18 million. In May, management was hopeful for the number to be below $10 million a day. The airline ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents, or 22.2% of 2019 revenue. Many investors have been encouraged by the cash levels the group has at hand. In case of a second coronavirus outbreak or another unexpected disruption to air travel in 2020, the airline will likely be in a safe position to survive the cross currents.

8,Southwest Airlines Is Offering Employee Buyouts. Its Stock Rises. | Barron's,Southwest Airlines’ Latest Gambit: Unloading Its Employees. Why Wall Street Is Bullish.. . . 8 Hardware Stocks to Buy for,"    Southwest Airlines is offering what it calls “the most generous” buyout packages in its history to ensure the company’s survival, according to a memo sent to employees. Investors are bidding up the stock, along with shares of other airlines, as carriers continue to see a slow recovery in travel and cut costs to regain profitability. Southwest (ticker: LUV) is offering employees with more than 10 years of service one year of pay and flight privileges if they take an early retirement package. Pilots would get a separate buyout package. The airline has now received $2.3 billion in payroll support under the federal Cares Act program, covering 70% of its payroll costs through Sept. 30, when the program expires. Shares of Southwest were up about 3% in trading Tuesday, amid a broader rally in airline stocks. The NYSE Arca Airline Index was ahead 2.2%. Analysts appear increasingly confident that air traffic has bottomed and is on a path to recovery—albeit one without precedent. Most airlines have slashed flight capacity by at least 75%, aiming to reduce their daily cash-burn rates. Airlines have parked roughly two thirds of their fleets, and they have permanently retired some of the biggest planes. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said recently that it was retiring its entire fleet of Boeing 777 jumbo jets, for instance. ”We have moved well past the point of no return with respect to Covid-19 and its potential to have an enduring, multiyear impact on the commercial aviation industry,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a report out Tuesday. Airlines are now cutting labor costs to restore profitability at far lower revenue levels. Last week, American Airlines Group (AAL) said it would cut management and support staff by 30%. Delta also offered more buyout packages. The good news is that passenger traffic appears to be inching back. Cowen analyst Helane Becker notes that U.S. passenger traffic has picked up about 10 percentage points off its lows on April 16. The seven-day moving average is now down 87% from a year ago, an improvement from declines of more than 93%, and traffic trends continue to show modest improvements, she wrote in a note published Tuesday. “We expect trends to continue to improve as states ease stay at home restrictions and leisure activities resume,” Becker writes. Her top picks are Southwest, Spirit Airlines (SAVE), and Delta.

9,Breakout Could Be Imminent For Airlines Stocks - ETF Focus on TheStreet: ETF research and Trade Ideas,"Breakout Could Be Imminent For Airlines Stocks. . 3 ETFs That Advisors Probably Wouldn't Add To Clients' Portfolio, But You","The travel and leisure industry, along with the airlines, has perhaps been the most savagely beaten group in the markets. With the COVID-19 outbreak wreaking havoc on the economy, the demand for travel has ground to a virtual halt. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) was down as much as 65% from it all-time highs, reflecting the lack of industry demand and corresponding impact to the bottom line. While many investors tend to run away from these falling knives, something unusual has happened here. Investors have actually flocked towards airline stocks. Like we've seen with oil stocks earlier this year, investors have been trying to buy the dip en masse. JETS had just $50 million in assets earlier this year, but is now sitting at nearly $1 billion. So far, investors haven't been rewarded as the share price for JETS has bounced mostly sideways since they started piling in. But that may be about to change. JETS has recently moved back to the top of its short-term range and could be poised to finally break out. With states continuing to slowly reopen their economies, investors have been eyeing increased demand for travel and leisure activities. Oil prices have already been reflecting the anticipated increase in demand, but airlines have yet to catch up. If JETS can break through that top trend line at around $16, it could be a relatively quick trip to $20, a 25% gain from current levels. The airline industry could take years to recover their pre-COVID levels, but with a P/E ratio of just 7, the valuation is compelling and difficult to ignore. At this point, I'd rate JETS a buy with a short-term $20 price target, but this may be more suited as a longer-term buy and hold.

10,Why stocks could keep going higher even with massive unrest across America,Why stocks could keep going higher even with massive unrest across America. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"The great rotation continues, with some of the most down-trodden names leading the market higher: industrials, airlines, financial institutions, and energy companies. Powerful monetary and fiscal stimulus programs are keeping stocks aloft, as investors continue to shift funds to parts of the market they believe will be helped by economic reopenings. So far, the market has not reacted to the violent protests that erupted all across the U.S. after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis resulted in charges of third-degree murder against a police officer. Across the U.S., there has been looting on city streets and buildings have been destroyed, yet the stock market has ignored it. “The market is a forward looking mechanism. They see six months from now, nine months from now there will be more semblance of order. The economy will be coming back, and earnings will be coming back. Estimates have stopped going down,” said Steven DeSanctis, Jefferies equity strategist. “You have the full support of the Fed ... the flows into credit markets have been incredible. The capital markets are open. IPOs and secondary offerings are getting done.” Since credit markets seized up in February, the Fed has created program after program to keep the credit markets moving, including more funding in short-term lending markets, Treasury purchases, a commercial paper facility, a municipal bond program, and a plan to buy corporate bonds. The Fed had already cut rates to zero, and has promised to do whatever else is needed, even as it ballooned its balance sheet to $7.1 trillion. With the Fed in the market, companies have already issued more than $1 trillion in new debt at twice the pace of last year, and at relatively low rates. That has enabled corporate America to restructure existing debt and build cash hoards to weather the downturn. Amazon, for instance, priced $10 billion in new debt Monday, including a 3-year bond with a 0.4% yield. “All of that outweighs what’s going on,” said Desanctis. “The big thing with social unrest is in two weeks from now, if we get an uptick int the virus and that delays openings, that is something that impacts markets.” Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC, said the protests could become an issue for stocks if they have a significant impact on consumer or business confidence, as the economy is reopening.

Is now the time to buy the stock? - The Motley Fool UK,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . easyJet’s share price has,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Edward Sheldon, CFA | Monday, 1st June, 2020 | More on: EZJ Over the last few weeks, easyJet (LSE: EZJ) shares have enjoyed quite a spectacular surge. Back in mid-May, you could pick up the shares for less than 500p. Last week however, easyJet’s share price rose as high as 772p at one point. The reason is easyJet recently announced that, after grounding its entire fleet back in March due to Covid-19, it will restart a “small number of flights” on 15 June. That’s obviously a positive development. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Are the shares worth buying now? Here’s my view.  When I last covered easyJet shares in late March, I said there was an “enormous amount of uncertainty in relation to the investment case.” My view was the stock wasn’t worth the risk. Clearly, the outlook now looks a little better for easyJet. In a few weeks’ time, the airline will begin flying again in the UK and France. And the company plans to announce further routes over the coming weeks as lockdown measures across Europe are relaxed and customer demand increases. Make no mistake though, there’s still a lot of uncertainty here. Potentially, it could be years before global travel returns to pre-Covid-19 levels. Recently, easyJet boss Johan Lundgren said he believes passenger numbers won’t return to 2019 levels until 2023. And, in the near term, I think it’s likely Covid-19 will continue to throw spanners in the works for airlines. As an example, just last week, a man onboard a plane in Spain discovered he had Covid-19 mid-air, which forced the aircraft and passengers into immediate quarantine on arrival.  And don’t forget about UK quarantine rules. From 8 June, people arriving from overseas arrivals into the UK will have to self-isolate for 14 days. How will this affect travel? Meanwhile, there’s questions over easyJet’s balance sheet. Recently, a top City airline analyst said easyJet may have to raise up to £1bn","Jun 1, 2020",https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2020/06/01/easyjets-share-price-has-taken-off-is-now-the-time-to-buy-the-stock/
14,JETS ETF Flying Toward New Complexion | ETF Trends,JETS ETF Flying Toward New Complexion. Filing Confirms New Look. RELATED TOPICS. . FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER. VANECK RESOURCES & REPORTS.,"The US Global Jets ETF (NYSEArca: JETS) is one of the industry ETFs garnering plenty of attention and investment dollars this year as investors look for rebound/reopening plays, but the fund could soon undergo some changes. JETS seeks to track the performance of the U.S. Global Jets Index, which is composed of the exchange-listed common stock (or depository receipts) of U.S. and international passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers, airports, and terminal services companies across the globe. Typically, the lone ETF focusing on airline equities is home to 30 to 35 stocks and is dominated by the four largest U.S. airlines, but that dominance could be reduced as the JETS index makes room for some Canadian carriers. A recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirms that the JETS Index will soon grow to 39 components, giving the fund more exposure to Canada. “At the time of each reconstitution of the Index, each of the four largest U.S. or Canadian passenger airline companies, as measured primarily by their market capitalization and, to a lesser extent, their passenger load factor, receives a 10 percent weighting allocation of the Index,” according to the filing. “Each of the next five largest U.S. or Canadian passenger airline companies receives a 4 percent weighting allocation of the Index.” The news comes as airline stocks appear attractively valued relative to other corners of the transportation universe. The New York Arca Airline Index showed a price-to-earnings of 5.7 as of the end of March, compared to the 14.5 P/E ratio for the S&P 500 Industrials Index, 20.1 P/E for the Dow Jones U.S. Trucking Index and 15.6 P/E for the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index. After the U.S. and Canadian components are factored into the JETS mix, there are qualifiers for the fund’s other holdings. “The remaining Airline Companies meeting the Index criteria are then scored based on multiple fundamental factors,” according to the filing. “Their score is primarily driven by their cash flow return on invested capital (CFROIC) with additional inputs based on sales per share growth, gross margins, and sales yield. Each of the five U.S. or Canadian companies with the highest composite scores receives a 3 percent weighting allocation of the Index, and each of the 25 non-U.S. and non-Canadian companies with the highest composite scores receives a 1 percent weighting allocation of the Index.” For more on tactical strategies, please visit our Tactical","Jun 2, 2020",https://www.etftrends.com/tactical-allocation-channel/jets-etf-flying-toward-new-complexion/

16,Buffett Rebuffed - CFO,"Accounting. June 1, 2020. Buffett Rebuffed. The Berkshire chairman decried the FASB mandate on new reporting for unrealized gains and","Warren Buffett was unequivocal in his criticism of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s ASU 2016-01 — the new accounting for equity securities passed in 2016 and implemented in 2018. In his 2017 letter to shareholders, Buffet noted: “The new rule says that the net change in unrealized investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be included in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capricious swings in our GAAP bottom-line. For analytical purposes, Berkshire’s ‘bottom line’ will be useless.” The crux of Buffett’s argument was that his intent is to hold securities forever, and therefore short-term fluctuations were irrelevant because he views them as partnerships and periodic market quotations don’t alter long-term value prospects. Donald Graham, chairman of Graham Holdings, came to Buffett’s defense in a November 2018 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal.  He said: “On paper, these [short term] fluctuations in stock value dwarf Berkshire’s actual business profits. In reality, they merely record short-term changes in the prices of stocks that may be held for decades before they are sold.” For good measure, he added, “Berkshire and all other companies already report gains and losses on stocks at the time of sale. Interim fluctuations shouldn’t be allowed to fuzz up reported earnings.” In response, I noted at the time: Warren Buffett “For equity securities for which there is less than a 20% ownership or no significant influence, this new standard more prominently reflects the value of the securities using the price Berkshire would need to exit these positions (e.g. exit price fair value). Although Mr. Buffett considers these businesses rather than ticker symbols, as noted in his remarks, the accounting for such appreciation in net income better reflects the difference in these positions than those over which Berkshire has greater influence or control and can contribute to the business operations. “It is more accurate to reflect the change in the value of these investments in net income as it occurs rather than simply when management’s intent changes and the decision to sell is made. Reflecting the realized gains in net income at that time inaccurately portrays such earnings as current period events, when in fact, the gains may have accumulated over many years. Now more than ever, the various methods of accounting for equity securities most accurately depicts Berkshire’s business model.” That response was and","Jun 1, 2020",https://www.cfo.com/accounting/2020/06/buffett-rebuffed/

18,"Coronavirus keeps aviation industry grounded - Few sectors have felt the impact of COVID-19 as deeply as aviation, and airlines are exploring all lines of finance to bolster balance sheets | White & Case LLP - JDSupra",". Coronavirus keeps aviation industry grounded - Few sectors have felt the impact of COVID-19 as deeply as aviation, and"," Coronavirus lockdowns have taken a heavy toll on the financial performance and stability of global airlines and their suppliers. According to aviation tracking site FlightRadar, the number of global passenger flights has fallen 77% since January 2020, and the US Transportation Security Administration reported a 96% drop in US traveler screenings compared to 2019 figures. Meanwhile, the ARCA Global Airline stock market index, which tracks global airline shares, shed just under 60% of its value this year. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts a US$252 billion fall in ticket revenues if travel bans remain in place for three months. The rapid decline in passenger traffic and revenues has forced airlines around the world to announce large-scale layoffs. Qantas has put 20,000 staff on leave and 700 pilots at American Airlines have taken early retirement. Airline financing structures have also come under strain. EasyJet, Ryanair, Lufthansa, IAG, Air Baltic and Turkish Airlines are just some of the operators that have had credit ratings downgraded and placed on watchlists. Some high profile airlines, such as Virgin Australia, have already been pushed into administration as a result. Avianca and LATAM also recently filed for Chapter 11 protection. All eyes will be on these cases as they may set the tone for how leases may be renegotiated in future Chapter 11 cases, and give us an understanding of which aircraft will be abandoned/rejected. The financial impact on airlines has rippled down the supply chain. Aircraft and engine manufacturers are preparing to cut thousands of jobs. Aircraft leasing companies, which own around half of the world’s passenger fleet, have also been squeezed. Lessors have been approached by airlines asking for rent deferrals and restructurings but have little room to play hardball as there are currently no other options for redeploying aircraft. Chapter 11 and administrations could be on the horizon for lessors without the backing of significant equity buffers. Cash-rich players, however, will be well-placed to win market share and buy up distressed rivals when lockdowns ease. In the face of these operational and financial challenges, aviation companies have been considering all available lending options to bulk out their cash balances. Government-backed loan programs, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the US and the UK Treasury’s coronavirus fund, have been the first port of call. Larger airlines with the resources to navigate and apply for the programs","Jun 1, 2020",https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/coronavirus-keeps-aviation-industry-57875/
