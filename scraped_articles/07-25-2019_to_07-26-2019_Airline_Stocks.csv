Airline stocks dragged down as Boeing,"Shares of airline companies traded mostly lower Thursday, as a more dire outlook on the groundings of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max planes sullied the earnings reports from Southwest Co. and American Airlines Group Inc. And the biggest ever one-day plunge in discount carrier Spirit Airlines Inc.’s stock SAVE, -2.60%  after disappointing guidance was also a drag on the sector. The NYSE Arca Airline Index XAL, -2.06% pulled back 3.3% in afternoon trading, after closing Wednesday at the highest level since May 1, 2018. The index was underperforming the broader stock market by a wide margin, as the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -0.58%  shed 86 points, or 0.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.41%  gave up 152 points, or 0.6%. Southwest LUV, -0.78%  reported before the open second-quarter earnings that beat expectations but revenue that came up short. The company said it would “proactively extend” the 737 Max-related schedule adjustments through Jan. 5, 2020, compared with its previous adjustments through Aug. 5, so customers can confidently book travel during the fall and holiday periods. The company said the estimate is based on the expectation that the 737 Max planes will return to service during the fourth quarter, and that it will take “one to two months” to comply with prospective regulatory directives, including pilot training. Investors seemed to appreciate Southwest’s proactive approach as the stock had dropped as much as 4.2% soon after the open, before bouncing sharply to be up 1.8% in afternoon trading. Don’t miss: Southwest takes drastic action to address 737 Max issues and stock is rewarded. Separately, Southwest said it would stop operating out of Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, given that financial results there have been below expectations, and will consolidate its New York City operations at New York LaGuardia Airport, starting Nov. 3, 2019. Meanwhile, American Airlines reported second-quarter profit, revenue and load factor that beat expectations and raised its full-year earnings outlook, but kept its 737 Max-related schedule adjustments through Nov. 2. Investors appeared weary, as the stock tumbled 7.8% in active trading. American said it now expects 2019 earnings-per-share to be between $4.50 and $6.00, up from previous guidance of $4.00 to $6.00. “Although the increase is encouraging, investors may question the guidance given the fluid nature of the Max situation (American has the aircraft out of its schedule through November 2 vs. Southwest’s","Jul 25, 2019",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/airline-stocks-dragged-down-as-boeing-737-max-groundings-sully-earnings-reports-2019-07-25

2,"Spirit Airlines Stock Crashes 24%, but Investors Are Missing the Point | The Motley Fool","Spirit Airlines Stock Crashes 24%, but Investors Are Missing the Point. The budget carrier released disappointing guidance for the third","   On Wednesday afternoon Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) reported that its adjusted earnings per share surged 52% year over year last quarter, continuing a recent trend of strong earnings growth. You might think investors would have been pleased with these results. Instead they zeroed in on Spirit's weak forecast for the third quarter, which was well below the market's expectations. As a result, Spirit Airlines stock plummeted nearly 24% on Thursday, ending the day at its lowest level in roughly a year.  SPIRIT AIRLINES STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. Yet while the company's guidance was certainly disappointing, many of the headwinds Spirit is facing are temporary. Profit growth should bounce back in 2020, and Spirit Airlines stock has massive long-term upside. Spirit Airlines continued its steady growth last quarter, expanding capacity 13.2% year over year. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) rose 5%. Together, these two factors drove an 18.9% increase in revenue to $1.01 billion. (Incidentally, this was Spirit's first-ever $1 billion quarter.) Adjusted nonfuel unit costs increased 4.6% in the quarter. This was a disappointing but expected result. In its initial guidance for the second quarter, Spirit Airlines had warned that a spike in flight cancellations due to Easter-weekend storms and runway construction in Fort Lauderdale (its largest base) would pressure Q2 nonfuel unit costs by 2.5 percentage points. Lower fuel prices offset some of this cost pressure, though. Spirit paid an average of $2.16 per gallon for jet fuel last quarter, down from $2.32 per gallon in the prior-year period. The net result was that Spirit Airlines' adjusted pre-tax margin rose to 14.8% from 11.7% in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted EPS spiked to $1.69 from $1.11 a year earlier. This surpassed the average analyst estimate of $1.65. Spirit Airlines will expand its capacity by 13% again in the third quarter. But this time it expects unit revenue to be roughly flat year over year (plus or minus 1%). Tougher comparisons are driving the sequential slowdown. RASM plunged 6.8% in the second quarter of 2018, whereas RASM rose 5.5% in last year's third quarter. SPIRIT AIRLINES' UNIT REVENUE GROWTH IS SET TO SLOW OR EVEN STOP THIS QUARTER. IMAGE SOURCE: SPIRIT AIRLINES. The more troubling part of Spirit's guidance -- and the main cause of Spirit Airlines stock's sharp drop -- was management's projection that adjusted nonfuel unit costs will surge 7% to 8%","Jul 26, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/07/26/spirit-airlines-stock-crashes-24-but-investors-are.aspx

4,Airline Shares Affected by Exposure to Boeing’s 737 MAX - WSJ,The Wall Street Journal. Airline Shares Affected by Exposure to Boeing’s 737 MAX. Reports from Southwest and American send many,"The grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX fleet is continuing to have ripple effects in the air-travel industry. Southwest Airlines Co. said early Thursday that it would end flights at Newark Liberty International Airport this fall. The reason: The airline, which has the largest exposure of U.S. airlines to Boeing Co. ’s 737 MAX, is dealing with a reduced capacity for flights while the jets are grounded. American Airlines Group , which along with Southwest reported earnings before the opening bell Thursday, delivered more bad news for the industry. It said the Boeing grounding would likely shave $400 million off its pretax earnings in 2019, up from earlier estimates of $350 million. American’s shares fell 8.4% Thursday. The dual reports sent many airline stocks lower, with the U.S. Global Jets exchange-traded fund—which includes U.S. companies such as Southwest, American and United Airlines Holdings Inc., along with foreign airlines—falling 1.7%. Southwest shares, which initially dropped, ended the day up 0.3% after executives stressed that they would use the planes they were flying into and out of Newark in markets like Hawaii that tend to be more lucrative.

5,American Airlines Earnings: Why AAL Stock Is Shifting Down Today American Airlines Earnings: Why AAL Stock Is Shifting Down Today | InvestorPlace,"American Airlines Earnings: Why AAL Stock Is Shifting Down Today. 737 Max cancellations hampered Q2 results. ""Set and Forget"" Strategy"," American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) rolled out its latest quarterly earnings figures Thursday, amassing a profit and sales that surpassed expectations, although aircraft cancellations are slated to harm its 2019 income, pushing AAL stock down close to 5%. The global airline — hailing out of Fort Worth, Texas — lifted the veil on its second-quarter results as it reached the midpoint of its fiscal 2019. Profit tallied up to $1.82 per share, besting the Wall Street consensus outlook by 4 cents per share. American Airlines sales increased about 3% when compared to the year-ago period, arriving at $11.96 billion. This figure is also a touch higher than the $11.975 billion that analysts predicted. Revenue and earnings may be stronger than Wall Street called for, yet 737 Max aircraft cancellations during the quarter lowered the period’s pre-tax income by about $175 million. This move is also projected to reduce fiscal 2019 pre-tax profit by roughly $400 million. On the positive side of things, American Airlines added that its passenger unit revenue gained 4%, while total unit revenue surged 3.5%. For its third quarter of 2019, the airline sees total unit revenue surging 1% to 3% year-over-year. As far as full-year earnings go, the airline updated its guidance to now be in the range of $4.50 to $6.00 per share, higher than its previous view of $4.00 to $6.00 per share. The midpoint profit outlook of $5.25 per share, ahead of the $5.16 per share that analysts called for. AAL stock is falling 4.9% as of Thursday in the early afternoon.

6,Does Aegean Airlines S.A. (ATH:AEGN) Have A Good P/E Ratio? - Simply Wall St News,Does Aegean Airlines S.A. (ATH:AEGN) Have A Good P/E Ratio?. How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?. Is A High,"This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll show how you can use Aegean Airlines S.A.'s (ATH:AEGN) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. What is Aegean Airlines's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 8.68. That means that at current prices, buyers pay €8.68 for every €1 in trailing yearly profits. See our latest analysis for Aegean Airlines The formula for price to earnings is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for Aegean Airlines: P/E of 8.68 = €8.25 ÷ €0.95 (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2019.) A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each €1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.' The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (8.7) for companies in the airlines industry is roughly the same as Aegean Airlines's P/E. Aegean Airlines's P/E tells us that market participants think its prospects are roughly in line with its industry. Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases. It's great to see that Aegean Airlines grew EPS by 13% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 6.1%. With that performance, you might expect an above average P/E ratio. It's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings. Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to","Jul 26, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/gr/transportation/ath-aegn/aegean-airlines-shares/news/does-aegean-airlines-s-a-athaegn-have-a-good-p-e-ratio/

8,The 20 Best Small-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy | Kiplinger,Save up to 67%. The 20 Best Small-Cap Dividend Stocks to Buy. Small-cap stocks aren’t generally viewed as income-oriented investments..,"Getty Images Small-cap stocks aren’t generally viewed as income-oriented investments. Nonetheless, there’s a handful of off-the-radar tickers that offer not only the growth potential typical of smaller companies, but cash generation, too. And at the moment, it might actually make sense for investors to seek out small-cap dividend stocks to buy, as counterintuitive as they might seem. Despite the strong start to the new year, the Russell 2000 Index of small caps has trailed large-cap stocks – as represented by Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index – in a big way since late February. That’s when the small-cap rally peaked. For the year-to-date, the S&P 500 has gained 19.1%, while the smaller-company index has gained 14.6%. This lull might ultimately prove a buying opportunity, however, and for small-cap dividend payers in particular. Waning bond yields are increasingly sending investors on a search for yields, and few large-cap income plays have proven up to the task. Here’s a rundown of 20 small-cap dividend stocks to buy now. Remember that buying shares of any small company – even a dividend payer – may come with added risks, which can include highly concentrated revenue streams and less access to financing. Also note that several of these companies will report earnings in the next couple of weeks, which will provide more clarity into their financial situations. 1 of 20 Getty Images It’s possible you work for an organization that calls ABM Industries (ABM, $41.05) one of its service providers. The company offers a variety of building-management solutions including cafeteria operations, lighting systems and even linen care. ABM can even take care of athletic fields. The opportunity is bigger than you might realize. The world spent almost $35 billion on third-party building managers last year, and that number is expected to hit $59.3 billion by 2023. Most institutions and building owners would rather simply outsource the tedious and often distracting work. It’s still a fragmented market. ABM is one of the biggest names in the business when excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs, which own the properties they manage), and it still secured just $6.5 billion in revenues over the past four reported quarters. That small piece of the market translates into an opportunity for growth, however, as scale even leads to greater cost-efficiency even with the often-ignored industry. ABM Industries’ dividend has grown reliably over the past decade; 2008’s total full-year payout of 41 cents","Jul 26, 2019",https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-the-20-best-small-cap-dividend-stocks-to-buy-2019/index.html

Seats have shrunk, legroom has vanished -- and the airlines aren’t done with you yet. Cebu Air Inc., the Philippines’ biggest budget carrier, last month said it was moving kitchens and bathrooms on some of its new A330neos to cram in a record 460 seats, 20 more than the plane’s current maximum. It’s part of a broader push, particularly in Asia, to stuff more people into jets flying the most popular routes, according to aviation researcher Landrum & Brown.  “It’s all a matter of squeezing as many passengers as they can,” said Mathieu De Marchi, a Bangkok-based consultant at the firm. “It’s only going to get worse over the next decade.” Even if paying customers are less happy, packing more of them into cabins has helped turn around the U.S. aviation industry in recent years. In Asia, where 100 million people fly for the first time every year, the strategy is now the bread and butter for low-cost carriers serving an exploding middle class that cares more about price than comfort. Asia’s demand has led to industry shortages of almost everything, from pilots and mechanics to airports and runways (to say nothing of leg room). Carriers go to great lengths to avoid buying more aircraft and having to pay for extra landing rights at airports that are close to bursting.

FIND US ON,"         Pro Trader - Market Scanning & Analysis Software Introduction Background – Trading is a twelve step process I have listed below what I believe are the twelve simple steps to trading success. These twelve points all require thought, planning and a degree of trial and error that will ultimately lead to a plan that suits your budget and your psychology. 1. Global Rules – These are rules you need before entering the market. I.E. “I will not purchase an airline stock.”
2. The Set-up – What price action on a chart are you looking for? Get to recognize how a chart should look, long before you buy a stock.
3. Finding a Stock – How do you find “the right” stock? I use the ProTrader end-of-day software tool that has been part of ongoing development process since 1998. This software quickly scans all stocks on a particular exchange searching for stocks that are giving various buy signals.
4. Entry Signals – You must have a clear reason or “buy signal” on a stock before making an investment into any company. My buy signals are predominantly based on technical analysis, that is, studying the chart.
5. Confirmation Signals – My main confirmation signal is a computer indicator called on-balance-volume. OBV gives me a very good idea of whether the buyers or the sellers are in control of the stock.
6. Fine Tuning Your Entry – One of the great benefits of the internet has been the introduction of various trading platforms. These platforms give every investor access to market depth. Market depth can be the key to perfecting the timing of purchasing a stock.
7. Risk Management – Assess how much you need to risk on each trade. Risk management is critical to trading success. Most people who buy a stock are only focused on the potential profits, however the first thought needs to be “How much am I prepared to risk in an effort to see whether I am right?!”
8. Money Management – Never plunge and never over-diversify. If you are developing a portfolio you need to strike a balance between putting all your eggs in one basket and over-diversifying.
9. Order Placement – Be precise and get it right. Many a loss has been the result of poor order placement – buying instead of selling, incorrect volumes etc.
