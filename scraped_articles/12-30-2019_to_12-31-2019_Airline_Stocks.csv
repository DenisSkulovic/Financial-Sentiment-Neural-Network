0,UPDATE 4-Norwegian Air punished as investors' worries over virus deepen | Reuters,UPDATE 4-Norwegian Air punished as investors' worries over virus deepen. . . . . . . . . . .,"Discover Thomson Reuters More By Terje Solsvik, Tommy Lund 3 MIN READ * Budget carrier says still expects to return to profit * Investors unconvinced, shares slump 25% to 11-year low * Shares now down 52% this week on coronavirus concerns * Other airline stocks also down sharply (Adds graphic, no change to text) OSLO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Shares in Norwegian Air plunged a quarter in value on Thursday, leading airline stocks lower as investors bet the debt-laden budget carrier would be the most vulnerable to a coronavirus pandemic. The slump in Norwegian shares to an 11-year low of 16.80 crowns came despite the company trying to reassure investors by reiterating its financial guidance. The stock has now lost 52% since the start of this week as the coronavirus has spread around the world, threatening an extended period of disruption to international travel. “This (share price slide) is the worry that corona depletes demand and that (it) creates a cash flow crunch at Norwegian,” Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote in an emailed comment. He added, however, that Norwegian’s ongoing cost cuts and planned asset sales could see the company through. Norwegian, which has repeatedly had to raise cash from its owners to survive, said at its quarterly results on Feb. 13 that it expected to report a profit in 2020 after three consecutive years of losses. “As of today, the company maintains the guidance and outlook presented in relation to the Q4 reporting on 13 February ... The company is monitoring the market situation on a regular basis,” Norwegian said in a statement on Thursday. It said it had put out the statement in response to “market speculation” and subsequent inquiries from shareholders. A pioneer in low-fare transatlantic air travel, Norwegian’s rapid expansion has left it in the red and heavily in debt, forcing it to cut unprofitable routes and slash operating costs. Rattled by the coronavirus, airlines have rushed to cut costs in recent days. Still, shares in Scandinavian carrier SAS fell by 12.3% on Thursday, while Easyjet was down 11.0%, Ryanair 5.7%, Lufthansa 7.2%, Air France 10.6% and British Airways parent IAG fell 10.0%. Norwegian raised cash from its owners in late 2019 for the third time in less than two years, and issued convertible bonds at the same time to help shore up its finances. The bonds have so-called covenants linked to the finances of a","Dec 31, 2019",https://www.reuters.com/article/norwegian-air-outlook-idUSL5N2AR3YZ
1,JetBlue Shares Are Cheap. Is Timing Still Bad? | The Motley Fool,"JetBlue Shares Are Cheap. Is Timing Still Bad?. Valuation metrics for the airline look cheap, but it might not be","   JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) is a low-cost airline that serves passengers in North and South America with more than 1,000 daily flights on average. The airline stock has been range-bound for the past year and a half, moving between $19 and $15.50.  Investors are bullish about the company's optimistic profit forecasts for next year, and initiatives to improve revenue and earnings with route reallocation, cost restructuring, load optimization, and purchases of more efficient new planes. The company also has an advantage over competitors that are dealing with grounded Boeing 737 MAX airplanes while regulators investigate the safety of those planes. JetBlue's fleet is almost entirely composed of Airbus (OTC:EADSY) airplanes, so it has an operational edge in the short term. JetBlue's passenger load factor, a measure of the extent to which flights are filled, was 84.7% through Q3 2019, which compares poorly to peers. Delta (NYSE:DAL) is among the industry leaders on this metric, and it is 180 basis points higher. The disparity in load factor and average ticket pricing also lead JetBlue to lower revenue per available seat mile (RASM), an important metric tracked by airlines to measure how efficiently they generate revenue with their services. JetBlue's $0.1222 RASM was 28% lower than Delta's. IMAGE SOURCE: JETBLUE JetBlue has delivered a 10.3% operating margin despite the above shortcomings, 350 basis points above the airline industry average. This is comparable to United's (NASDAQ:UAL) operating margin and superior to American Airlines', but inferior to Delta's, Spirit's, and Southwest's. JetBlue's 9.57% return on invested capital (ROIC) stacks up in a very similar way. This pattern suggests that JetBlue does a fair job of utilizing its financial resources to deliver returns, but there are more efficient peers in the market.  JetBlue's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 8.2, well below the airline industry average of 14.4. The company's 5% to 6% top-line forecast growth rate and 21% earnings growth forecast results in a very attractive PEG ratio well below 1.0. JetBlue has among the highest analyst consensus growth forecasts among airlines. The stock's 5.07 EV/EBITDA compares favorably to the industry average of 6.65, and it is lower than Delta, Southwest, United, American Airlines, Allegiant, Spirit, and Alaska Air.  These would seem to imply that the stock is cheap, but other metrics complicate this. JetBlue's 16.1 price-to-free-cash-flow is high among airlines, which average 11.8 on this metric, which could indicate relatively low-quality","Dec 31, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/31/jetblue-shares-are-cheap-is-timing-still-bad.aspx

6,WestJet (TSX:WJA) Will Miss December 31st Dividend Payment - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . WestJet (TSX:WJA) Will Miss December 31st Dividend Payment. The deal pulled through,"      Adam Othman | December 30, 2019 | More on: WJA One of the primary reasons for investing in dividend stocks is the promise of payouts. Airline stocks have had a difficult time in recent years. WestJet Airlines (TSX:WJA), in particular, has not been enjoying itself. Climbing more than 70% in 2019, the shares have gained momentum since Onex announced that it should acquire the company. From a transaction valued at around $5 billion back in May, Onex expected to acquire the publicly traded airline company. WestJet had been paying quarterly dividends of $0.14 per share. With the acquisition by Onex, WestJet had announced that it would pay investors their final dividends of $0.14 per share on December 31, 2019. Onex and WestJet recently announced that the newly acquired airline company would no longer be liable to pay shareholders dividends. WestJet was ultimately on track with paying shareholders the quarterly dividends as they have in the past, despite Onex taking over. Both companies announced that there was a change in plans since the deal between the two companies closed earlier than expected on December 18, 2019. The airline’s board of directors declared its intent to disburse dividends on December 28, 2019, when the deal was still underway. The Toronto-based private equity firm and the affiliated firms of the company announced that the final regulatory approval was met on December 17, 2019. WestJet continued to achieve control and ownership requirements based on the Canadian law following its purchase by Onex. Onex declared that its portion of the total equity investment is around $345 million as a limited partner. It is also the largest investor among the Onex Partners V, and it did not disclose more information apart from that regarding the deal. As far as the current investors of WestJet are concerned, Onex is planning to pay shareholders $31 in cash for each share of the company that they own. The shares will soon be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange within a few trading days to make WestJet a purely private company again. Onex was required by the Canadian Transportation Agency to amend its bylaws to ensure that matters related to WestJet would be voted by the board of directors where a majority of Canadian directors are present. Not receiving dividends, as promised, might be a little disappointing for shareholders. It is a business, and","Dec 30, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/12/30/westjet-tsxwja-will-miss-december-31st-dividend-payment/

Canadian business has experienced devastating commodity price crashes, droughts of initial public offerings, the rise in popularity of exchange-traded funds, the end of marijuana prohibition, and the collapse of historic retailers. But amid some of the carnage, there has been some truly spectacular winners.
In the waning days of the last decade, if you booted your online trading account and put down a decent bet on any of the following stocks – and held on for the next 10 years straight – you might be celebrating the new year on a new yacht moored to your own private island (okay, that would have been a really big bet).

10-year total return: 1,030%
If you had invested $10,000 it would be worth $113,000 Dollarama has been a bargain for investors who put their money to work in the stock over the past decade.
The discount retailer is in a unique business situation because it has to grow its bottom line while sticking to fixed price points. But growth hasn’t been an issue as Canadians’ love affair with dollar stores hasn’t wavered.
At the turn of the decade, Dollarama had 652 locations across the country and had just started experimenting with $2 price tags.
Over subsequent years, the company continued to grow – opening more locations and introducing higher price points for its items. In 2017, the company’s shares spiked after Dollarama announced it was raising its store growth plan by several hundred locations and would begin accepting credit cards as payment, affirming its position as Canada’s dominant dollar store.
But it all came to a halt in 2018 as slowing sales spooked investors. That was followed by a report issued by short-seller Spruce Point Capital Management, which sent the stock tumbling. Since then, the company has made concerted efforts to stay truer to its name and cap future price increases for items, to the delight of customers.
The company is also looking to a new future in Latin America after closing a new stake in Dollar City, which will add international exposure in addition to its current 1,236 Canadian locations. Symbol: ENGH

11,"Apple is 'overpriced' by $100 a share, tech investor Paul Meeks warns","Apple is 'overpriced' by at least $100 a share, tech investor Paul Meeks warns. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips.","The year's top Dow performer may come under pressure in 2020. Tech investor Paul Meeks is worried Apple's 2019 record run is putting investors in a dangerous position. By his calculations, the iPhone maker is worth much less than $290 a share. ""I value the company at about $170 a share, believe it or not,"" the portfolio manager at Independent Solutions Wealth Management told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Monday. ""We're talking about a company that based on my model is about $100 per share overvalued."" Meeks, who's known for running the world's largest technology fund during the dot-com boom, cites fundamentals for his bearish view — particularly a maturing global smartphone market. ""People are excited, perhaps too much so as the company transitions from a hardware product iPhone-dominated company to ... software as a services company,"" he said. ""The stock is overpriced."" Apple shares have soared 85% so far this year, and Wall Street is embracing the rally. According to FactSet, analysts have 20 buy ratings versus six sell ratings. Ten analysts are neutral on the stock. Yet, Meeks is cautious. Within the next year or so, he expects Apple will deliver a couple of disappointing earnings reports that will lead to a sharp correction. ""The last time that we saw nice growth in global smartphones was back in 2015,"" he said. ""It's not healthy. It's not a growth market."" Meeks went negative on Apple on ""Trading Nation"" on April 29, 2019. Since then, the stock is up 43%. Yet, he didn't entirely miss out on the rally. Meeks still owns shares in his clients' portfolios as an underweight because he knows he's being judged versus the tech benchmarks. Plus, he still views Apple as an ""iconic"" company. But he has no plans to buy more Apple shares unless they fall at least 40% from current levels. ""The iPhone business continues to deteriorate,"" Meeks said. ""[It's] very akin to the slowdown in maturity that we saw in the PC market as we kind of went from the '80s to the '90s."" Disclosure: Paul Meeks owns Apple shares.

12,Banks take Sh12bn hit in Kenya Airways shares - Business Daily,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"A Kenya Airways plane at JKIA. FILE PHOTO | NMG Ten local banks including Equity , KCB and NCBA have suffered a combined paper loss of Sh12.7 billion on their Kenya Airways’ shares as the airline’s stock plummeted to new lows. KQ, as the national carrier is known by its international code, in 2017 issued the lenders with 2.2 billion shares to settle their loans amounting to Sh17 billion. The shares were acquired at a price of Sh7.78 each but the airline’s stock price has since dropped 73 percent to trade at lows of Sh2 in recent days, resulting in the lenders’ paper loss of Sh12.7 billion. The banks are now pinning their hopes on a generous buyout offer from the government which has decided to nationalise the company once again. Details of the nationalisation plan, including timelines and the price for buying out the banks and other shareholders, are yet to emerge. The lenders have not disclosed how they value their KQ holdings. The move to nationalise the carrier comes after the company’s losses continued to rise, wiping its shareholder funds. The Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm reported a Sh8.5 billion net loss in the half year ended June, more than double the Sh4 billion net loss the year before as costs rose faster than revenue. Turnover in the review period rose to Sh58.5 billion from Sh52.1 billion, representing a 12.2 percent increase. The loss saw the company’s negative equity widen to Sh16.1 billion from Sh2.4 billion, underlining its capital crisis. KQ’s problems have been linked to a mix of increased competition, corruption, mismanagement and a previous debt binge that continues to weigh on its balance sheet. Long-term individual investors have fared even worse since they will only break even if they are bought out at Sh21.2. The small investors were diluted 95 percent besides their number of shares being reduced by a factor of four as part of efforts to rescue the airline from collapse.","Dec 31, 2019",https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/banks-take-sh12bn-hit-in-kenya-airways-shares-2274800

USD/JPY.,"                                                   In 2013 Steve Kelley was appointed CEO of Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR). First, this article will compare CEO compensation with compensation at similar sized companies. After that, we will consider the growth in the business. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels. See our latest analysis for Amkor Technology According to our data, Amkor Technology, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$3.2b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$3.9m over the year to December 2018. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the salary is lower, valued at US$859k. We further remind readers that the CEO may face performance requirements to receive the non-salary part of the total compensation. We examined companies with market caps from US$2.0b to US$6.4b, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was US$5.1m. That means Steve Kelley receives fairly typical remuneration for the CEO of a company that size. Although this fact alone doesn't tell us a great deal, it becomes more relevant when considered against the business performance. The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at Amkor Technology has changed from year to year. On average over the last three years, Amkor Technology, Inc. has shrunk earnings per share by 19% each year (measured with a line of best fit). Its revenue is down 9.8% over last year. Few shareholders would be pleased to read that earnings per share are lower over three years. And the impression is worse when you consider revenue is down year-on-year. It's hard to argue the company is firing on all cylinders, so shareholders might be averse to high CEO remuneration. It could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.

14,Boeing 737 Max Should Return In 2020 But The Crisis Won't Be Over | Investor's Business Daily,Boeing 737 Max Should Return In 2020 But The Crisis Won't Be Over. Boeing 737 Max Production Outlook. Charges To,"BREAKING: Futures Rise On Big Gains For Nike, Banks    New to Investors.com? The Boeing 737 Max will likely return to service sometime in 2020, but that won't close the books on one of the aerospace giant's worst crises in its 103-year history. Boeing (BA) stock actually finished 2019 with a 1% gain, but management will have to address key questions in the coming year, such as how quickly production can ramp back up and how much compensation airlines will get for the grounding. Boeing and Turkish Airlines on Tuesday reportedly agreed to a $225 million compensation deal. Lawsuits from families of crash victims and investigations are also pending. The Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly probing Boeing's financial disclosures related to the grounding. Congress, the Justice Department, FBI and the Transportation Department inspector general's office also have been looking to see if the company provided misleading information about the Boeing 737 Max to regulators and customers. And the FAA is investigating 737 Max production practices. For now, top Boeing 737 Max customers expect the plane to fly again in early to late spring. Southwest Airlines (LUV) and American Airlines (AAL) removed the jet from their schedules until April, while United Airlines (UAL) has removed it until June. But those are just the U.S. carriers with the Boeing 737 Max in their fleets. Depending on when regulators around the world OK the plane, the return to service elsewhere may take longer. Chairman and incoming CEO Dave Calhoun suggested in an interview with CNBC in November that the return of the Boeing 737 Max may take until 2021 to complete ""in its entirety."" Then there is the flying public. Airlines will have to deal with passengers who find out if their flight is on a Boeing 737 Max and want to change to a different plane. Some airlines will let skittish passengers switch, but European budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) reportedly won't and won't offer refunds either. To stop the flow of grounded jets spilling out into employee parking lots at the Seattle-area factory, Boeing will halt production of the narrow-body jet starting in January and told its suppliers to stop deliveries starting in mid-January. Boeing previously slowed 737 Max production to 41 a month in April as the global grounding took hold, but planned to ramp up to 46 by the end of 2019, then to 52 by February","Dec 31, 2019",https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-max-service-return-2020-crisis-not-over/

Weirdest Economy Ever In my decades of looking at the stock market, there has never been a better setup. Exuberance is pandemic and sky-high. And even after today’s dip, the S&P 500 is up nearly 29% for the year, and the Nasdaq 35%, despite lackluster growth in the global economy, where many of the S&P 500 companies are getting the majority of their revenues. Mega-weight in the indices, Apple, is a good example: shares soared 84% in the year, though its revenues ticked up only 2%. This is not a growth story. This is an exuberance story where nothing that happens in reality – such as lacking revenue growth – matters, as we’re now told by enthusiastic crowds everywhere. Until just a couple of months ago, the touts were out there touting negative interest rates soon to come to the US and thus making stocks the only place to be. Those touts have now been run over by reality. Now they’re touting QE4 by the Fed, or whatever. And people were looking for any reason to buy. The unanimity of it all was astounding. I’ve seen this before, but not in this magnitude. And there is this: As stocks were surging over the past few months, investors with large gains who wanted to sell didn’t sell before year-end in order to defer that income for tax considerations. So there was reduced selling pressure from that group that would have liked to sell, and that will sell after the new year starts. So I shorted the stock market today, December 30 – me who is on record of saying repeatedly that I would never ever short anything ever again, after the debacle of November 1999 when I shorted the most obviously ridiculous Nasdaq high-fliers a few months too early. They collapsed to near-zero, but not before ripping off my face. But I changed my mind. The setup is just too perfect. A year ago, on December 22, 2018, as stocks had been plunging, I wrote, Nothing Goes to Hell in a Straight Line, Not Even Stocks. That turned out to be true – practically nothing goes to hell in a straight line. I expected a bounce. I didn’t expect that the bounce would be this huge. But now it’s part of the setup","Dec 30, 2019",https://wolfstreet.com/2019/12/30/i-who-vowed-to-never-ever-short-stocks-again-just-shorted-the-entire-market/

The cash reserves of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway have swelled to nearly $130 billion and there is pressure to make a jumbo-sized buy. By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is currently hoarding $128 billion in cash. The investing conglomerate has accumulated this amount over the years on the grounds that there are no attractive acquisitions to make as stocks have become too expensive. This has come at a cost, as Berkshire Hathaway has now underperformed the S&P 500 for a decade. While its holdings have gone up 259% in the past decade, the large-cap index has posted a gain of 314%. In 2019, the S&P 500 appreciated by 18% while Berkshire Hathaway’s shares ticked up by 7.1%. This underperformance, amidst ballooning cash reserves, means Buffett must go shopping. Earlier this year while delivering the investing conglomerate’s 2018 annual letter, Buffett promised to make an ‘elephant-sized acquisition’. As this has so far failed to materialize, 2020 is the year Buffett will come under enormous pressure to open his wallet. Below are three stocks that could receive the ‘Warren Buffett seal of approval’ in 2020. Earlier this year, Berkshire Hathaway made an offer to acquire technology distributor Tech Data for $5 billion. The Warren Buffett outfit was outbid by Apollo Global Management. Buffett’s rationale for his interest in Tech Data was its size, scale and fair value. Additionally, with Tech Data being a middleman possessing hundreds of relationships with tech companies, it’s a ‘steady’ business cushioned from the","Dec 30, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/3-stocks-warren-buffett-could-spend-his-128-billion-2020/

19,"If History Repeats, Video Game Stocks Could Soar 690%+ | RiskHedge","If History Repeats, Video Game Stocks Could Soar 690%+. I’m Talking About Video Game Stocks. Sony (SNE) Issued a Blockbuster","A new super cycle is revving up. And if history repeats, this super cycle will hand out profits of 8X to 18X, starting now. If you’ve studied investing, you’ve likely come across the idea of “cyclical” assets. Cyclical assets go through boom and bust cycles. One year they surge in price, the next year they plummet. Housing stocks are cyclical (read our recent guide on how to profit from the biggest housing boom in history), airline stocks are cyclical, gold is famously cyclical. Most commodities like oil, wheat, and steel are cyclical. Let me tell you about a new super cycle that was just born in a quiet corner of the markets. Like other cyclical assets, the “video game super cycle” has everything to do with supply and demand. You see, a new generation of video game consoles comes out every five to eight years. These new consoles run faster than previous versions. They feature better graphics and offer new games. This isn’t just a big deal for “gamers.” It’s a mammoth opportunity for investors. During the last video game boom, you could have pocketed returns of 8X, 14X, and 18X in just six years! It said it will release its highly anticipated PlayStation 5 video game console next year. Microsoft (MSFT) will also introduce its “next-gen” console—code named “Project Scarlett”—just in time for the 2020 holidays. The video game industry has been waiting years for this news. Sony last made an announcement like this in February 2013 when it unveiled the PlayStation 4. Eight months later, PlayStation 4 hit the shelves. Microsoft rolled out its own system, Xbox One, a week later. Since then, Sony has sold more than 90 million PS4s! Microsoft has sold 44 million Xbox Ones. Electronic Arts (EA), which makes the popular FIFA and Madden NFL video games series, soared 1,261% between 2012 and 2018.  Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) threw off even bigger gains. Take-Two is best known for its Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto game series. Its share price skyrocketed 1,665% during the last super cycle.  Activision Blizzard (ATVI), best known for its insanely popular Call of Duty series, posted the smallest gains of these three. It surged “just” 690% from 2012 to 2018.  These companies don’t sell consoles like Microsoft and Sony. They sell video game titles. These are the video game stocks you want to focus on.
