1,3 Dividend Stocks That Are Perfect for Retirement | The Motley Fool,"3 Dividend Stocks That Are Perfect for Retirement. Dividends, price, and growth are all key to these companies' attractiveness as","   What do you look for when you're looking to buy a dividend stock to help pay for your retirement? A big dividend, obviously. But perhaps you'd also like a stock selling for a nice price -- cheaper than the average stock costs, so there'll be a chance you are buying low so that you can later sell high? And how about a bit of growth, to help that stock go higher?   Maybe you'd even like to buy a stock that suits your new, retired lifestyle, so you can keep a close eye on how your investment is performing in the real world? Well, in that case, you're in luck. The following three stocks may just fit the bill: Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL). IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. If you're retired now, or thinking about doing so soon, you're probably well past the ""minivan"" stage of life, and the midlife crisis sports car phase as well. It's time to settle down and buy a nice, reliable, highly rated sedan. According to U.S. News and World Report, one of the top ""15 best cars for older drivers"" in America is the Toyota Camry, nicely priced at $24,295 and boasting an unsurpassed ""overall score"" of 8.6 out of 10 possible points.   The Camry isn't just a car for old-timers, though. Car and Driver magazine notes that Toyota's Camry was the best-selling sedan, period, among American car buyers in 2018, and so far in 2019 it looks likely to retain that title. (Toyota also has the best-selling SUV, the RAV4.)    In short, Toyota is a very successful car company. But how does it stack up as a dividend stock? Well, beginning with the most important attribute, Toyota pays its shareholders a generous 2.5% dividend yield. (That's about 25% more than the average stock on the S&P 500 pays, by the way.) Toyota's price-to-earnings ratio of 8.7 is just a small fraction of the 24 times earnings that the average S&P stock costs, too. And with a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 14.6%, Toyota shares are likely to grow earnings faster than most other stocks to boot. As a first stock to consider when seeking dividend stocks, Toyota gets us off to a great start.

2,Alaska Air's Strong Momentum Continues | The Motley Fool,Alaska Air's Strong Momentum Continues. A bullish Q4 investor update suggests that Alaska Air could continue delivering strong earnings growth,"   After suffering severe margin erosion in 2017 and 2018, West Coast airline Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) has gotten back on track in 2019. For the first nine months of the year, revenue per available seat mile (RASM) rose 4.1%. And while nonfuel unit costs increased 2.9% -- partly due to one-time factors and the timing of expenses -- Alaska's average fuel price fell 3.5%. As a result, adjusted pre-tax income surged 33% year over year, from $611 million to $811 million. Alaska Air's revenue and earnings momentum is continuing in the fourth quarter, as evidenced by the carrier's recent investor update. That bodes well for its ability to continue rebuilding its profitability in 2020 and beyond. ALASKA AIR HAS REPORTED STELLAR PROFIT GROWTH IN 2019. IMAGE SOURCE: ALASKA AIRLINES. Two months ago, Alaska Air projected that unit revenue growth would slow somewhat in the fourth quarter, with RASM rising 1% to 4% year over year. On the other hand, it estimated that non-fuel unit costs would increase less than 1%, while fuel costs would decline 8% year over year. The combination of higher unit revenue and lower unit costs is obviously great for profit growth. In fact, the midpoint of Alaska's initial guidance for the fourth quarter implied that adjusted earnings per share would soar to around $1.30, compared to $0.75 in the year-ago period. On Monday, Alaska Air bumped up its quarterly guidance, just as it had done in each of the two previous quarters. The airline now expects RASM to rise 2% to 4% year over year this quarter, implying that its revenue momentum is continuing. That's particularly impressive because it faces a tough year-over-year comparison: Whereas RASM declined 2.3% in the first nine months of 2018, Alaska bounced back with a strong 5.2% RASM gain in last year's fourth quarter. On the cost side, Alaska Air reduced its non-fuel unit cost estimate by about 0.2%. The airline's average fuel price is set to come in at $2.20 per gallon -- about 2% higher than the October forecast -- but better-than-expected fuel efficiency is poised to offset nearly all of that headwind. The net result is that analysts expect Alaska Air's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to reach $1.38 this quarter. Based on its year-to-date results and current Q4 forecast, Alaska Air is on track to achieve an adjusted pre-tax margin of around 12% in 2019.","Dec 21, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/21/alaska-airs-strong-momentum-continues.aspx

5,10 2019 Losers That Will Be 2020 Winning Stocks to Buy | InvestorPlace,10 2019 Losers That Will Be 2020 Winners. These 10 stocks missed out on the market rally this year —," Source: Shutterstock 2019 has been an excellent year for U.S. stocks to buy. The S&P 500 has risen 27.3% so far this year. It and other broader market indices trade at all-time highs. Unsurprisingly, most stocks have performed well this year. Just 14% of S&P 500 components have declined year-to-date. 27 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average have gained. Not every name has joined in the rally, however. There are some sectors that have lagged. It’s been an ugly year for energy stocks, and even worse for cannabis plays. Many of 2019’s initial public offerings have disappointed. And other stocks, whether due to external factors or poor execution, have stumbled in 2019. Many of 2019’s losers likely will continue to struggle in 2020 and beyond. After all, this has been a market where investors have done better to pick the winners, and bet on growth, rather than hope for a recovery. But there are stocks that simply had a bad year — and look set for a potential recovery as the calendar turns. These 10 stocks all have declined so far in 2019, but have hopes for a brighter 2020. 15 TECH STOCKS SET TO CASH IN ON THE 5G REVOLUTION YTD Performance: -10% The case for Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is relatively simple. Investors can own one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies at 13.5x estimated 2020 earnings. And in a low interest rate environment where the 10-year Treasury bond yields less than 2%, those investors can realize a 3.9% dividend yield following a recently announced 5.6% hike. The case against PFE stock is almost as simple: that bull case simply hasn’t played out all that well in recent years. PFE shares have gained just 23% over the past five years, underperforming the S&P 500’s 55% rise. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical business may not be the safe haven investors once believed it was. Rival Merck (NYSE:MRK) should grow its near-term earnings at a faster clip, and it has been the much better stock in recent years. In a market where the winners keep running and the losers seemingly fall behind, MRK might be the better choice. From here, however, Pfizer stock looks like an attractive pick, particularly for investors looking for income and some downside protection. Pfizer’s valuation is about as reasonable as it gets. It has underperformed the market — but that’s not necessarily a surprise","Dec 20, 2019",https://investorplace.com/2019/12/10-2019-losers-that-will-be-2020-winners/
6,"Here's What Spirit Airlines, Inc.'s (NYSE:SAVE) P/E Ratio Is Telling Us - Simply Wall St News","Here's What Spirit Airlines, Inc.'s (NYSE:SAVE) P/E Ratio Is Telling Us. How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?.","This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll look at Spirit Airlines, Inc.'s (NYSE:SAVE) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. What is Spirit Airlines's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 8.16. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 12.3%. View our latest analysis for Spirit Airlines The formula for price to earnings is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for Spirit Airlines: P/E of 8.16 = $41.29 ÷ $5.06 (Based on the year to September 2019.) A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each $1 the company has earned over the last year. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E. The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Spirit Airlines has a lower P/E than the average (9.1) in the airlines industry classification. This suggests that market participants think Spirit Airlines will underperform other companies in its industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling. Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up. It's great to see that Spirit Airlines grew EPS by 11% in the last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 12% per year over the last five years. So one might expect an above average P/E ratio. Don't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one","Dec 20, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-save/spirit-airlines/news/heres-what-spirit-airlines-inc-s-nysesave-p-e-ratio-is-telling-us
7,Alitalia facing shut down by mid-2020?,"Alitalia facing shut down by mid-2020?. World needs more freighters, can Boeing produce more 747s?. IAG plans to buy Air","Bankrupt since 2017, Italy’s flag carrier Alitalia was promised a fresh infusion of $400 million in funds earlier in December 2019. But the lifeline could be the state’s last attempt to keep the troubled carrier afloat, media reports now indicate. If the latest grant is indeed the last one that Italy’s government makes, this means that the mid-2020 would be a crucial time for the airline’s survival: it either finds a suitable investor or closes its doors for good.  Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said Italy’s government would no longer provide funds to keep the ailing state’s flag carrier afloat and the latest state intervention is indeed the last one, as reported by Reuters on December 21, 2019. The airline’s future appears to depend on the outcome of an ultimatum, as Patuanelli said that either a buyer is found by mid-2020 or the carrier “would shut down”.  On December 2, 2019, the Italian Council of Ministers signed documents to grant $443 million (€400 million) loan for the airline in hopes to help it remain in the air until the summer 2020. The fresh infusion of funds would come on top of the previous state aid, reportedly already reaching €900 million. So far, the newest grant is guaranteed by the state, but not yet allocated and it has to be approved by the European Commission. Alitalia went into special administration in May 2017, after the airline’s employees rejected another austerity plan, leading to the carrier’s bankruptcy. The Italian government initially granted a bridging loan of €300 million, followed by an additional €600 million in October 2017. As the rescue talks continue to drag on, the government has indefinitely delayed the repayment of the €900 million sum. Since Alitalia went into administration, the Italian government has begun a so far fruitless endeavor of finding the airline an investor. The list of (rumored) suitors included state railway company Ferrovie dello Stato, infrastructure group Atlantia, European carriers EasyJet, Ryanair, Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) , Wizz Air, Air France-KLM, and the U.S. legacy carrier Delta Airlines (DAL) . However, it appears that none of them are left in the game.  Various deadlines came and went within the two years since Alitalia was declared bankrupt. Allegedly burning €2 million every month, the national carrier remains alive and still kicking.  In the most recent disclosure, Alitalia reported that its passenger revenues during the first eleven","Dec 21, 2019",https://www.aerotime.aero/24377-alitalia-facing-shut-down-by-mid-2020

USD/JPY.,"                                                   It's always best to build a diverse portfolio of shares, since any stock business could lag the broader market. Of course, the aim of the game is to pick stocks that do better than an index fund. One such company is Avantium N.V. (AMS:AVTX), which saw its share price increase 23% in the last year, slightly above the market return of around 20% (not including dividends). Note that businesses generally develop over the long term, so the returns over the last year might not reflect a long term trend. Check out our latest analysis for Avantium Avantium isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit. Avantium actually shrunk its revenue over the last year, with a reduction of 25%. The stock is up 23% in that time, a fine performance given the revenue drop. To us that means that there isn't a lot of correlation between the past revenue performance and the share price, but a closer look at analyst forecasts and the bottom line may well explain a lot. You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). Balance sheet strength is crucial. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time. In the last year the market returned about 25%, and Avantium generated a TSR of 23% for its shareholders. A substantial portion of that gain has come in the last three months, with the stock up 16% in that time. It could be that word is spreading about its positive business attributes.

This is about a three-month delay from the company's initial expected dates of the end of the year 2019. “We planned to have our commercial infrastructure completed by year-end, but due to the upcoming holidays and advanced planning needs of our customers, we expect to announce schedules, pricing and initial flights near the end of first quarter 2020.

Discussion of markets,"Dear Fellow Shareholders, For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, the PRIMECAP Odyssey Stock Fund, PRIMECAP Odyssey Growth Fund, and PRIMECAP Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund produced total returns of +11.22%, +5.75%, and +4.71%, respectively. The unmanaged S&P 500 index pro-duced a total return of +14.33% during the period. Unfavorable stock selection detracted from results relative to the S&P 500, while sector allocation had a more mixed impact across the funds. During the fiscal year, the American economy’s decade-long expansion moderated somewhat, demonstrating signs of late-cycle fatigue amid a broader global slowdown. Consumer spending generally remained healthy, bolstered by continued labor market strength, even as consumer con-fidence dipped in the summer months. But business investment weakened of late, a notable reversal from year-ago conditions, and trade-driven uncertainty has hindered business confidence. Elsewhere, major foreign economies slowed, particularly in Europe and China, and geopolitical tension intensified, including an apparent Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia oil infrastructure and a further deterioration in U.S.-China relations. The Federal Reserve responded to the unease with three interest rate cuts, an about-face from last year’s tightening campaign.  The equity market proved resilient in the face of this widespread uncertainty, finishing the period at record-high levels. The S&P 500’s +14% return defied a sharp deceleration in corporate earn-ings throughout the year, as analysts now project just +1% earnings growth for the S&P 500 index in 2019, well below original expectations for double-digit growth. Indeed, the index’s cur-rent expected earnings for 2020 nearly match year-ago expectations for 2019 earnings, implying forward valuation climbed in tandem with the market’s ascent. Defensive sectors real estate (+27%) and utilities (+24%) led the market as beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve’s dovish pivot to lower interest rates, but many cyclical sectors also outperformed, including information technology (+23%) and consumer discretionary (+16%). Weakness, meanwhile, was concentrated in energy (-12%) and health care (+9%), which were beset by declining crude prices and domestic political scrutiny, respectively. The market’s performance overall featured something of a flight to quality, with bond-proxy defensive stocks and high-quality cyclical stocks both benefitting. In a sense, and somewhat counterintuitively, persistent anxiety and wilting bond yields together fueled the market rise, with investors crowding into ostensible safe harbors across disparate sectors. We tend to fish in less tranquil seas, willfully eschewing perceived safety in return for what we assess as greater risk-adjusted opportunities.

Earlier this month, the RP had sought an extension for the","The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Friday allowed Ashish Chhawchharia, resolution professional for Jet Airways, to extend the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of the grounded airline by 90 days. Earlier this month, the RP had sought an extension for the resolution period after the Colombian Synergy Group failed to submit a business plan for the revival of Jet Airways by December 16. Jet Airways was admitted for insolvency on June 20, after lenders failed to sell the grounded airline. The 180-day deadline as stipulated under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act, 2016, for the resolution of Jet Airways ended on December 16. Meanwhile, earlier this week, two parties besides Synergy Group expressed initial interest in Jet Airways. FE reported that lenders had in-principle agreed to call for fresh bids for the beleaguered airline. The final decision will be taken by Saturday. On Thursday, the two-member bench of the Mumbai NCLT had asked the committee of creditors (CoC) to decide within three weeks on calling for fresh expressions-of-interest for Jet Airways. On Thursday, the NCLT met Synergy Group Corp chief operating officer Michael Welch and told representatives of the Synergy Group to “take a decision early” on Jet Airways. Welch told the tribunal that the Synergy Group had put forth conditions including assurance on slots in India, London Heathrow Airport and the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. Welch met lenders and officials of Jet Airways on Thursday and will also be meeting government officials over the next few days. Jet Airways was grounded eight months ago on April 17 after lenders refused to provide emergency funding to continue operations. Creditors have filed claims worth over `36,000 crore with the airline, of which the RP has admitted claims worth over Rs 14,600 crore as of October 20.

Had others just enabled the prosecution in this case and the justice system to unfold as it should, we wouldn’t be in the situation that we are now. “ To take you behind the scenes of how our newsroom operates, we have a daily story meeting every morning and several show-specific discussions about the day's interviews and major stories.
