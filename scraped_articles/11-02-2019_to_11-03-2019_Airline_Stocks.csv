1,Why You Should Sell Air Canada Stock Before 2020 - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why You Should Sell Air Canada Stock Before 2020. A downturn in,"      David Jagielski | November 3, 2019 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) (TSX:AC.B) is trading near its 52-week high and as well as the stock has done this year, there may not be enough upside left for investors to continue holding onto the stock. Shares of Air Canada have risen more than 80% since the beginning of 2019, and with the stock now more than three times its book value, it may not be the deal that it once was. Here’s why I’d be considering selling Air Canada stock today: In its most recent quarterly results, the airline’s operating revenues grew just 2.5% from the previous year — and that’s with the economy still performing at high levels. If a recession does end up happening and 2020 becomes a softer year for the economy, one place that could get hit the hardest is the airline industry. Travel is a common area that corporations focus on when there’s a need to tighten budgets, and the same goes for individuals who may opt to delay a vacation to a year when they have more cash coming in. With fewer travellers, Air Canada’s growth numbers could take a big hit and potentially turn negative. While at 11 times earnings investors aren’t paying a big premium for Air Canada’s growth today, there’s nothing as deflating for a stock as a drop in revenue or guidance, and that’s a scenario that could become reality sooner rather than later. The past year has generally been a good one when it comes to oil prices. West Texas Intermediate, a key benchmark in North America, has stayed below US$60 for much of the year and there hasn’t been a lot of movement up in price. But in September, we saw just how quickly the price of oil could take off when a disruption to Saudi Arabia’s oil production sent prices soaring. While that was just a temporary bump, it’s a reminder of how volatile the commodity can be. With the Saudi Aramco IPO right around the corner, there will also be an incentive for Saudia Arabia to ensure that oil prices are much stronger than they are today. While low oil prices may remain that way for now, investors shouldn’t take that as a given. Oil is a big variable in Air Canada’s cost structure, and an increase in commodity prices","Nov 3, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/11/03/why-you-should-sell-air-canada-stock-before-2020/

In the decade since then, the popular low-fare airline has become far more disciplined about growth and capital allocation. Indeed, between late 2009 and the end of 2017, JetBlue slashed its debt from $3.4 billion to just $1.2 billion. It did so by slowing its growth rate, paying for most new aircraft with cash, and using virtually all of its excess cash flow for debt reduction.  JETBLUE FINANCIAL DEBT (QUARTERLY), DATA BY YCHARTS. As a result, JetBlue now has one of the best balance sheets in the airline industry. The company is capitalizing on that position of strength by pivoting its capital allocation strategy to focus more on share buybacks. Recent debt offerings indicate that JetBlue plans to continue buying back stock at a steady pace. JetBlue began returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way via share repurchases in 2017. (Prior to that point, the company had bought back some stock, but only enough to offset the shares it was issuing as part of its employee stock ownership plan or as stock-based compensation.) In the first nine months of 2017, JetBlue repurchased $380 million of stock, exhausting its share repurchase authorization. Just before the end of that year, the company's board approved a new two-year $750 million share repurchase authorization. JetBlue is set to complete that program this quarter. In September, JetBlue's board authorized a new $800 million buyback program that will run from Oct. 1, 2019 until the end of 2021.

Last quarter, the company reported a diluted share count of 295.9 million, down from 341.6 million in the final quarter of 2016.

Jet Airways stock, which could be out of","Jump to navigation  It would seem beyond common investing logic, but the grounded Jet Airways is still flying on the bourses. Since October 18, Jet scrips on the BSE have gained over 44 per cent and closed on Friday at Rs 24.40 apiece. The stock, which could be out of most investors' portfolios by now, steadily gained nearly 45 per cent in just the past nine trading sessions, surprising analysts and investors alike. This is primarily owing to the October 18 announcement that the company shall be the first to undergo insolvency proceedings under the Cross Border Insolvency Protocol included under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), said Amit Gupta, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), TradingBells. ""This could speed up the bankruptcy proceedings, thereby increasing the chances of bringing some quick relief to its shareholders. Those believing that the market has undervalued the debt-ridden company would continue to buy, pushing up the stock prices,"" Gupta added. Gupta said that Jet Airways is a distressed stock, undergoing bankruptcy proceedings managed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Although non-operational, Jet is not yet unlisted from the stock exchange and there are people holding on to these shares as trading instruments. The share price had continuously fallen from Rs 265 levels in April 2019 to Rs 15.45 on October 18, 2019, post which it has been hitting the upper circuit on a regular basis. In a major breakthrough for India's insolvency mechanism, which is still in its evolving stage, Jet Airways would be the first Indian company to undergo insolvency proceedings under the Cross Border Insolvency Protocol. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had allowed the Dutch court administrator of Jet Airways to attend the meetings of the bankrupt airline's Committee of Creditors (CoC). The resolution professional and the Dutch administrator, however, filed an application seeking an amendment to the September 26 order providing approval to the Dutch administrator, which the appellate tribunal has accepted. The grounded Jet Airways owes over Rs 8,000 crore to its lenders. Besides the lenders, the airline is estimated to have a total liability of about Rs 25,000 crore which includes dues of operational creditors. Jet Airways on April 17 announced temporary suspension of all flight services as it failed to secure interim funding to maintain even the bare minimum operations.

6,Norwegian Air Shuttle’s new boss battles to save struggling airline | Financial Times,Cookies on FT Sites. Latest on Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA. Norwegian Air Shuttle’s new boss battles to save struggling airline.,"STEER FROM CRISIS TO
RECOVERY WITH THE FT Tanya Powley, Transport Correspondent Geir Karlsen has been busy. Over the past four months, the chief executive of Norwegian Air Shuttle has sold off a large chunk of the airline’s assets at a remarkable pace as he attempts to secure the future of the world’s fifth-biggest low-cost carrier. But the 54-year old acting chief executive, who took the top job in July and also wears the airline’s chief financial officer hat, remains sombre. “We’re not happy”, he said, when asked if he is pleased with the changes he has made, but added that the airline is “on the right track”. Mr Karlsen’s task is huge. The fast-growing group has been a disruptive force within the airline industry since it announced plans to launch low-cost transatlantic flights in 2012, leading the charge in reducing fares and forcing rivals to respond with their own budget services. But Norwegian’s turbocharged growth has put Europe’s third-biggest low-cost airline under heavy financial pressure. Since April last year, the company’s share price has plummeted 75 per cent as investors have worried that the Oslo-based carrier has overstretched itself. It has a big debt burden of NKr62bn ($6.8bn). It tapped investors for money twice in the past two years and it remains heavily lossmaking. According to Bloomberg consensus figures, the airline is not predicted to make a net profit until 2021. This year, analysts are estimating a NKr2.16bn net loss. The Nordic airline has also been hit by problems beyond its own control in recent years, including ongoing engine troubles with Boeing’s Dreamliner aircraft, the grounding of the 737 Max since April, and an aborted takeover attempt by Spanish rival IAG, the owner of British Airways. Significantly, Mr Karlsen has not ruled out another rights issue to raise money from investors to help keep the airline afloat. “This is a fight for survival, there’s no doubt about it,” said Daniel Roeska, aviation analyst at Bernstein. Just a year ago, Norwegian announced a significant strategic shift, prioritising profitability over growth and raising fresh capital. This plan has accelerated over the past six months, with the airline restructuring two maturing bonds, selling a stake in a Norwegian bank, as well as implementing a NKr2bn cost-cutting programme. It has also changed both its chief executive and chairman as it cut ties with its old ambitious growth strategy. In October, Norwegian also sealed a","Nov 2, 2019",https://www.ft.com/content/799a0fec-fc94-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6

Stock Market up BIG! Record highs for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Enjoy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2019  Gold, along with traditional safe haven assets like bonds, have continuously been on the rise over the past two weeks, amidst fears of a possible recession despite the strong performance of the equities market. The upside momentum of gold during an extended stock market rally indicates that investors are not fully convinced fundamental issues including geopolitical risks are resolved. According to Citigroup investment strategist Ken Peng, the stock market selloff of Q3 was caused by an overreaction from investors. Peng noted that investors feared slowing global economic growth, Brexit and the trade war, which added to international geopolitical risks and led to an increase in demand for safe havens. He said: “Investors were panicking about the trade war, global growth and Brexit in the summer and now they realized the situations aren’t that bad. I’d recommend investors to focus more on equities and high-yielding bonds in the coming three to six months.” Hence, the recent momentum of the S&P 500 and the rest of the U.S. equities market has been widely attributed to the outflow of capital from the bond market as recession fears cooled.

It would be fitting given that 2019 has been a sneakily strong year with the S&P 500 22.2% higher. Market conditions are supportive, and there are a number of powerful catalysts including positive seasonality, underexposed fund managers, strong market breadth, bearish sentiment, and a more dovish FOMC in 2020. This chart from LPL Financial shows a tendency for stocks to have a year-end rally also known as a Santa Claus rally. This is even more pronounced in pre-election years. When stocks gained more than 20% by the end of October, it resulted in positive gains in November and December 13 out of 14 times. Essentially, bullish seasonality is compounding on top of each other.  Given this reality, underexposed and under-invested funds could become forced buyers. According to a report from Hedge Fund Research, the average hedge fund is up 4.9% over the first three quarters of the year. Fund managers who under-perform their benchmarks are at risk of losing investors, and even their jobs. Fund managers are underexposed to equities due to reservations about the economy or odds of a successful trade deal but may have to buy anyway to not fall further behind their benchmarks. This dynamic is the fuel behind some of the most infamous Santa Claus rallies in history. Money managers in this position are desperately waiting for prices to come down.

9,Is Aegean Airlines S.A.'s (ATH:AEGN) 7.4% Dividend Worth Your Time?,. . . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY.,"                                                   Could Aegean Airlines S.A. (ATH:AEGN) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments. A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Aegean Airlines. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Aegean Airlines for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Aegean Airlines! Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Aegean Airlines paid out 62% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time. We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Aegean Airlines's cash payout ratio in the last year was 37%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously. With a strong net cash balance, Aegean Airlines investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective. Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Aegean Airlines's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.

On Friday, the pop star, 26, hosted a costume party called “Ariana’s Twilight Zone” at her home — which she terrifyingly transformed into a “haunted hotel” with the help of design planner Tricia Smith Brown. “Thank you @triciasmithbrown & team for transforming my home into the most stunning, haunted hotel,” the “7 Rings” singer shared on Instagram in a since-deleted post. “I can’t believe how incredible everything and everyone was. thank you for making all my spooky, twisted, twilight zone dreams come true.” In the post, the singer shared some footage of the spooky set-up, which featured a long candle-lit dinner table occupied by creepy skeletons and chilling music playing in the background. RELATED: Ariana Grande’s Halloween Costume Is Inspired by an Iconic — and Creepy! — Twilight ZoneEpisode Grande’s brother, Frankie James, and their mother Joan were both in attendance, with Frankie sharing a photo of the trio from a photo booth and captioning it, “the family that scares together… 👻👻👻👻.” The 36-year-old dancer also shared a series of photos with some other famous faces who stopped by the spectacularly scary party, including Demi Lovato and Lizzo. RELATED: Lizzo Drops Remix of ‘Good as Hell’ Featuring Ariana Grande: ‘He Better Know My Worth’ The “Thank U, Next” singer was dressed in her The Twilight Zone inspired costume for the event. Grande transformed herself into one of the characters from the iconic series’ “Eye of the Beholder” episode. Before the big costume reveal, the singer shared a scene from the episode, in which a young woman named Janet Tyler goes through a series of surgeries in order to look like everyone else finally. When her bandages are taken off, the audience sees that nothing appears wrong with her face — until the other characters are taken out of the shadows and have upturned noses and giant, twisted mouths.
