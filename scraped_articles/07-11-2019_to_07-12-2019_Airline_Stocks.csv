0,Airline industry heading for summer boom - Chinadaily.com.cn,Airline industry heading for summer boom,"With the approaching of the peak air transport season in summer, and the grounding of troubled B737 MAX aircraft, demand has exceeded supply in the domestic aviation market, which will lift flight ticket prices and boost the sales of carriers and their stock performance, industry analysts said. New York investment bank Goldman Sachs shifted its overall view of China's aviation sector to positive, as it expects the valuations of the sector will be supported by growing demand. Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of State-owned carriers Air China and China Eastern Airlines from ""neutral"" to ""buy"" on Thursday, for shares listed in the Shanghai A-share board and in Hong Kong, according to its report. The firm forecasts that the annual demand growth rate of China's aviation sector will accelerate to 12 percent or more. So far this year, the growth rate has been 10 percent, it said. Air China shares edged up 0.33 percent in Thursday trading to close at 9.1 yuan ($1.32). China Eastern shares rose 0.5 percent in trading to close at 6.04 yuan. In the same note, Goldman Sachs raised its target price of Air China stocks to 12.4 yuan, and raised its target price of China Eastern stocks to 8.3 yuan. ""The aviation sector in China is expected to have a good performance this year, fueled by the ongoing consumption upgrade trend in the country, despite the fact that the growth rate will slow down a bit, and the cost of air fuel may edge up in the second half of year,"" said Zou Jianjun, a professor at the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China. ""With the grounding of 96 B737 MAX planes in China, the model's largest market, air transport supply is inadequate to meet demand during the peak summer season, which will benefit the profitability of carriers, and those airlines with clear strategies and sound networks will perform better,"" he said. In the first half of this year, airport stocks overall have surged by 60.5 percent year-on-year, and airline stocks have climbed by 20.8 percent year-on-year. Since early July, airlines have increased their capacity by more than 10 percent year-on-year, and passenger flows have jumped rapidly, with a large number of people taking their summer vacations, according to a report from China Merchants Securities Co Ltd. ""Particularly, the demand of travel to South Korea and Japan has been robust, and the positive sales of flight tickets","Jul 12, 2019",http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201907/12/WS5d27dc8ca3105895c2e7d102.html

2,Indigo crisis: Investors anxious as airlines' stock crashes - The Financial Express,Indigo crisis: Investors anxious as airlines’ stock crashes. The Interglobe stock crashed 17.55% in intra-day trades and closed 10.7% lower,"By Chirag Madia & Malini Bhupta SBI Mutual Fund’s management on Wednesday met with Rakesh Gangwal, co-promoter of InterGlobe Aviation, to get a better understanding of the problems in the company which runs Indigo. The Interglobe stock crashed 17.55% in intra-day trades and closed 10.7% lower at Rs 1,397.95 on Wednesday, after the spat between the co-promoters Gangwal and Rakesh Bhatia reached the regulator. The volume in the counter was a high 1.3 crore shares compared to the daily average over the last six months, of 18.37 lakh shares, according to Bloomberg data.  The ownership data from BSE as of March 31, 2019, shows that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) owned the biggest chunk of 14.98% in InterGlobe. It was not immediately known whether any of the FPIs has met with the InterGlobe management. Mutual funds and non-institutional investors held 5.03% and 4.95%. Apart from SBI MF, which holds close to 3.00% in the company, others that have a stake include ICICI Prudential MF and Kotak Mahindra MF. Investors are understandably apprehensive the operations of the airline would be affected if the differences between the promoters are not resolved soon. Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of proxy advisory firm IIAS, said bankers and lenders could turn wary of financing the large aircraft acquisition plan coming up. “Existing lines with banks may see some contraction if lenders believe the governance issues will impact credit quality,” he said. Tandon suggested that in general the Articles of Association should not be embedded with shareholders’ rights. “The articles of association should be cleaned up as you cannot have embedded rights in them. Others have pointed out a company of the size of InterGlobe cannot have merely six board members and that too half of them nominated by one promoter group. JN Gupta, founder and MD of Stakeholder Empowerment Services, said it was hard to to pin the blameon any one person. “In a company where both promoters hold almost equal stakes, there’s little anyone can do till one party quits,”Gupta said. Some corporate experts believe it might be better if one promoter sells out to the other. The shareholder agreement between Gangwal and Bhatia, who hold 36.69% and 37.9%, respectively, expires in October but the articles of association extend beyond that. The public spat between Bhatia and Gangwal took a turn for the worse on Tuesday with Gangwal reaching out to the regulator","Jul 11, 2019",https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/indigo-crisis-investors-anxious-as-airlines-stock-crashes/1640176/

6,Small caps are flashing a warning signal ignore at your peril,"This group of stocks is flashing a warning sign — ignore it at your ‘peril,’ says expert. MORE IN TRADING","Small caps are underperforming and, if history is any indication, it could be a warning sign for the broader market. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap companies, is trading at its lowest relative performance to the S&P 500 since the financial crisis, according to data from Bespoke.  Unlike the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, all of which soared to all-time highs on Wednesday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled a rate cut may be coming this month, the Russell 2000 hasn’t hit a new high since last August. It’s currently trading about 10% below its peak. Miller Tabak’s Matt Maley argues that investors should take note of the Russell’s slowdown since in multiple instances over the past four decades it’s been a precursor for problems in the broader market. “I’m very concerned about those who say that the small caps don’t matter too much... There’s been so many other times where it’s been a very big warning signal,” he said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” After looking at the index’s chart, Maley says that the Russell has been trading in a trend channel since the beginning of the year, and that if it breaks below its low from January 3, it would be a “big, big warning sign for the rest of the market.”  He also warned that the current economic backdrop of slowing growth and domestic earnings estimates coming down are additional headwinds that small-cap companies must face. Maley was quick to note that he’s not predicting “a crash or anything like that,” but that investors’ ignoring the small-cap slowdown do so at “their own peril.” Chad Morganlander of Washington Crossing Advisors said he remains “underweight small caps at this point” since he anticipates they will continue to underperform over the next 12 months. “The reality is we’re having a global slowdown and small-cap indices, they’re cyclically exposed. Largest component is financials, industrials, and materials. So we would be avoiding small caps all together...because of the flattening of the yield curve, trade concerns, and global growth.” Instead, he recommends being “overweight large-cap quality companies,” particularly in the “health-care and consumer staples” sectors.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   CAIRO, July 11 (Reuters) - Benin departed the Africa Cup of Nations on Wednesday without winning a game but will return home as heroes after elimination in the quarter-finals by much-fancied Senegal. They created one of the great Cup of Nations upsets by knocking out Morocco in the last 16, albeit in a penalty shootout, and kept Senegal at bay for about 70 minutes in the last-eight clash before succumbing to Idrissa Gueye’s goal. ""We have mixed feelings because we feel we could have reached the semi-finals,” Benin striker Steve Mounie said. “We are proud on the one hand but on the other, we thought we could have gone further.” Benin were competing at their fourth Cup of Nations tournament, having lost eight of nine matches at the previous three in 2004, 2006 and 2010, drawing the other. That record meant they were not given much chance in a strong group alongside holders Cameroon and perennial contenders Ghana. But they held both heavyweights and Guinea Bissau to draw, amassing three points to sneak through as one of the best third-place finishers, before sending shockwaves through the competition as they rode their luck to force an extra time stalemate with Morocco, another of the favourites, and advance on penalties. It was a triumph that set off fevered celebrations in the small west African country where sporting success has previously been unknown. But Senegal, at Cairo’s 30 June Stadium, proved a bridge too far. “It was a great journey and it’s a pity we stop here,” added defender Olivier Verdon, who made vital tackles to keep Senegal striker Sadio Mane and his team mates at bay before being sent off eight minutes from the end. “We can walk away with a lot of pride despite being knocked out. We can hold our heads high. If you told us before the tournament, we would reach the quarter-finals, we have all signed up for that,"" Verdon added. “These results turned on small details. That’s how it is at the highest level. But we will learn, this experience will make us grow,” he said.","Jul 11, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soccer-winless-benin-head-home-090646166.html

The share price of," The escalating promoters spat at IndiGo has seen the share price of its parent, InterGlobe Aviation, plummet over 21 per cent in the past month. The stock declined as much as 17.54 per cent to touch a low of Rs 1,291 on the BSE on Wednesday, after co-founder Rakesh Gangwal alleged serious corporate governance lapses at the company in his 23-page letter to SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi. A day after seeing an erosion of Rs 6,462 crore in its market capitalisation, the stock continues to be in trouble - the share price fell further to Rs 1272.90 in the morning trade today. That's bad news for the country's largest carrier with a market share of 49 per cent. But Gangwal, who owns a 36.68 per cent stake in the airline, would rather face this financial pain today than see IndiGo falter five or 10 years down the road. ""The nation can ill afford IndiGo faltering. IndiGo is now very much intertwined with the economic well-being of the country,"" he told The Economic Times, adding that it the issue of poor corporate governance at InterGlobe Aviation is not corrected today, ""down the road we could have a situation like what happened with some other airlines and other companies in India"". Gangwal's complaint letter to SEBI stated that even a ""paan ki dukaan"" (betel shop) would have managed matters with more grace. """"I have vigorously attempted for almost a year to persuade the Company to shore up its governance standards, and all my attempts have been thwarted by the IGE Group,"" it read. According to him, the shareholders' agreement provides the other co-founder Rahul Bhatia - who along with his InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) Group owns around 38 per cent stake in IndiGo - unusual controlling rights over the airline. ""Beyond just questionable Related Party Transactions [between IndiGo's parent and IGE Group], various fundamental governance norms and laws are not being adhered to and this is inevitably going to lead to unfortunate outcomes unless effective measures are taken today,"" Gangwal alleged, adding that the company has ""started veering off"" from the core principles and values of governance that made IndiGo what it is today. A copy of this letter has also been sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal among others.

In its half-year results, easyJet reiterated that its pre-tax profit expectations for 2019 remain unchanged and in line with market expectations. But that has not stopped some investment banks downgrading the low-cost airline’s stock ahead of its Q3 results next week, with HSBC changing its rating from ‘hold’ to ‘reduce’ last month. The bank offered a disappointing review of the European airline sector following German carrier Lufthansa’s profit warning on June 17. ‘With the March quarter results, European low-cost carriers and tour operators offered quite cautious revenue commentary,’ HSBC analysts said in a note to investors. ‘With its 17 June profit warning, Lufthansa flagged very weak short-haul revenue trends in Q2, markedly worse than it described at its end-April Q1 report.’ ‘This comes despite the benefit of Easter and European capacity growth of only 4%, the lowest seen in Europe since the Global Financial crisis. Indeed, airline supply has only recently tightened with the 737 Max grounding.’ In its half-year results, easyJet conceded that revenue per seat in the second half of the year is expected to be slightly down, with the airline negatively impacted by Brexit-related market uncertainty as well as a wider macroeconomic slowdown in Europe. easyJet issued €500 million worth of bonds under its Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme on Thursday. The bonds mature in June 2025, have a coupon of 0.875% and are expected to be rated Baa1 (stable) by Moody's and BBB+ (stable) by Standard & Poor's, with over 150 pan European investors participating in the issue. ‘We are pleased with the success of this bond issue,’ easyJet CEO Andrew Findlay said. ‘The interest shown by investors at 3.4x oversubscription and competitive pricing underscores the market's confidence in easyJet's strategy of long-term profitable growth and industry leading balance sheet","Jul 11, 2019",https://www.ig.com/en-ch/news-and-trade-ideas/shares-news/easyjet-share-price--what-to-expect-from-its-q3-results-190711

Student From,"   Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider  Delta considers itself lucky that it doesn't have any Boeing 737 Max aircraft in its fleet.  Shares of Delta climbed more than 2% in early trading Thursday after the company beat Wall Street expectations for the second quarter and raised its revenue outlook for the remainder of the year.  The Atlanta-based airline reported net income of $1.5 billion, narrowly outperforming analyst expectations of $1.48 billion.

It’s not hard to see why people are worried about that possibility. Last week’s initial public offerings for DoorDash (ticker: DASH), Airbnb (ABNB) and C3.ai (AI) appeared positively out of control, with huge post-listing gains for all three. The sell-off that has followed over the past few trading days smacks of buyers’ remorse. There... Enterprise hardware stocks have been outperforming the market recently, and there should be further gains ahead. That’s the view of Morgan Stanley hardware analyst Katy Huberty, who lifted her price targets and earnings estimates for many stocks across the sector in an extensive research note Wednesday.

15,Can you short sell ETFs?,"Can you short sell ETFs?. . ADVISOR INSIGHT. Compete Risk Free with $100,000 in Virtual Cash. Related Articles. 4 Ways","ETFs (an acronym for exchange-traded funds) are treated like stock on exchanges; as such, they are also allowed to be sold short. Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons: One benefit ETFs provide to the average investor is ease of entry. These products do not have uptick rules, so investors can decide to short the shares even if the market is on a downtrend. What this means is that rather than waiting for a stock to trade above its last executed price (or an uptick), the investor can short sell the shares at the next available bid and immediately enter into the short position. This is important for investors wishing for quick entry to capitalize on the market's downward momentum. With regular stocks, the investor would not be able to enter into the position if the downward pressure was great. Patrick Traverse, CFP®
MoneyCoach, Charleston, NC Yes, you can. One of the main differences between an ETF and a mutual fund is the way that it is traded. A mutual fund is purchased and redeemed directly from the fund company at the end of the trading day, while an ETF trades on the exchanges like a stock. Because of this difference, you are able to short an ETF. There is also a growing number of ETFs that are meant to replicate the reverse movement of a certain index, in effect shorting the index. This way you do not have to deal with the issues that shorting individual securities can bring. Some of these funds are also leveraged which would amplify your bet if you hold a very bearish view.

By: Josiah Wilmoth | Email | Leave a comment The Dow eagerly sped toward a fourth consecutive gain on Friday, just one day after the stock market bellwether zoomed past its previous record to close above 27,000 for the first time ever. But as Wall Street continues to bid up valuations more than a decade into this bull run, one Morgan Stanley executive warns that the stock market could be on the verge of a 10% crash – dovish Fed or not. Wall Street’s three major indices each traded higher to open the week’s final trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to yet another all-time high at the bell; the DJIA last stood at 27,168 for a gain of 79.97 points or 0.3%. The S&P 500 once again edged past the elusive 3,000 point mark. The index added 3.35 points or 0.11% to trade at 3,003.22. The Nasdaq rose 12.02 points or 0.15% to 8,208.06. Wall Street continues to squeeze every last bit of optimism out of Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s congressional testimony, which – Fedspeak or not – clearly signaled that at least one interest rate cut is coming. But as the stock market continues to grace new heights on the back of corporate buybacks and dovish monetary policy, Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson warns that the party won’t last forever.   Wilson’s not exactly what you’d call a bear, but he does believe the market has become imprudently cavalier about the risks that this decade-long expansion","Jul 12, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/dow-morgan-stanley-stock-market-crash/
