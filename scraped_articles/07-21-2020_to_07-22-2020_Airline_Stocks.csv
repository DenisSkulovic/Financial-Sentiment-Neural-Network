0,"Avoid airline stocks, trader says as United reports $1.6 billion loss","Avoid airline stocks, trader says as United Airlines reports $1.6 billion loss. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Avoid the airlines. That was trader Todd Gordon’s advice to investors on Tuesday ahead of United Airlines’ second-quarter earnings report after the bell. The company reported a $1.62 billion net loss that it attributed to a pandemic-fueled slowdown in air travel demand. United Airlines shares were down about half of 1% in premarket trading on Wednesday after closing up more than 2% on Tuesday. Executives plan to hold a conference call with analysts to discuss the results Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET. U.S. air travel dropped for the first time since April this week as coronavirus case counts spiked in some areas of the country. “We’re generally avoiding the space,” Gordon, a managing director at Ascent Wealth Partners, told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday, citing the group’s “terrible economics,” “high fixed costs” and “very little pricing power.” “We think Delta’s best in class, but we do expect bankruptcies across the industry from Covid,” he said. “Even pre-Covid, profitability was a struggle, and the work-at-home, stay-at-home environment will only exacerbate that.” Gordon also found some red flags in a chart of the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS).   “We’re struggling to hold that $15 support after the short squeeze up to 22,” he said. “If we were to break back below 15, that is concerning.” He also called attention to the JETS-S&P 500 ratio in the lower panel, saying the trend lower means “the airlines are moving lower at a faster rate than the S&P.” “They’re scrambling to cut costs, they’re likely to continue to burn through a significant amount of cash until this demand picks back up, and Warren Buffett, rightfully or wrongfully so, sold his entire position in U.S. airlines. So, for now, we’re staying away,” Gordon said. Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, agreed that airlines had a tough road ahead. “If you think about the airline business, 10% of travel is business travel, and that’s responsible for 75% of profits. And ... most business travel just simply isn’t happening,” Schlossberg said in the same “Trading Nation” interview. With most businesses conducting meetings over Zoom — or, for those who must travel, renting or buying fractional shares of jets or finding other means of transport — turning a profit is getting more and more difficult for airlines, he said. “Given that dynamic where you basically have to chase the lowest common denominator,","Jul 21, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/avoid-airline-stocks-trader-says-as-united-prepares-earnings-report.html

Baker downgraded three carriers from Outperform to Underperform ratings: (JBLU) (JBLU), (SAVE) (SAVE), and United Airlines Holdings (UAL). Analysts are now cutting their 2021 revenue forecasts, pushing out recovery estimates to the second half of the year. Some might think it's an odd time to buy airline stocks. The Street disagrees. Budget airline Spirit Airlines' Relative Strength (RS) Rating climbed to 82 Thursday, up from 79 earlier. The 82 RS Rating means that Spirit Airlines has outperformed 82% of all stocks over the past year.  United, JetBlue and Spirit shares get a downgrade to sell from JPMorgan, which advises investors to take profits. J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker lowered his ratings on the three airlines to underweight from overweight. On Tuesday, shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) saw unusual options activity.

The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are","Jul 21, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SAVE/
2,Should You Sell Airline Stocks as Demand Plateaus? | The Motley Fool,"Should You Sell Airline Stocks as Demand Plateaus?. Air travel demand is sagging, following strong sequential improvements during May and","   July was supposed to be when the recovery in air travel demand would accelerate. Just one month ago, airlines were experiencing strong sequential growth in passenger traffic and ticket sales. Disney World's theme parks were scheduled to reopen beginning on July 11, followed by Disneyland on July 17. The CDC's No Sail Order for cruise lines was set to expire a week later, on July 24. Instead, with the COVID-19 pandemic spiraling out of control again, there has been only a muted recovery in leisure travel. And while Disney World did reopen, Disneyland remains closed indefinitely, and the No Sail Order was recently extended to at least Sept. 30. Does this mean investors should sell airline stocks now? For some airlines, perhaps -- but in general, it's not quite that simple. More than 60,000 new U.S. COVID-19 cases were reported every day last week, according to The New York Times. That compares to an average daily case count of around 21,000 in late May. Meanwhile, deaths from COVID-19 averaged 771 per day last week: well below the levels seen in mid-April, but up from around 500 per day in early July. Several states are running out of hospital beds or have full ICUs due to rising caseloads. Not surprisingly, this has hurt air travel demand. First, many people who might have been eager to travel this summer are reconsidering whether it is safe enough to fly. Second, with some states delaying or reversing measures to reopen their economies (including tourist attractions), people have less reason to take vacation trips. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. In an ominous sign for airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) have warned very explicitly that demand is not recovering as quickly as they had hoped. Confirming this trend, the TSA reported on Monday that passenger throughput at its checkpoints averaged approximately 664,000 people per day during the week ended July 19: 25.5% of the prior-year level. A week earlier, throughput stood at 26.9% of 2019 levels. Notwithstanding the recent wobble in demand, airlines have dramatically reduced their cash burn in recent months. Most carriers have cut costs significantly, while the flood of refund requests has slowed compared to the early days of the pandemic. For example, Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) estimated late last month that cash burn had slowed from a peak of $400 million per month in March to","Jul 21, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/21/should-you-sell-airline-stocks-as-demand-plateaus.aspx

6,A Vaccine Could Cure Airlines | Asharq AL-awsat,. A Vaccine Could Cure Airlines. Read More for Matt Levine. Subscribe to opinion newsletter. Most Read in Opinion. Other," The most interesting correlation in the stock market right now is the one between (1) the prices of airline stocks and (2) the amount of antibodies produced by coronavirus vaccine candidates in clinical trials. So far the vaccines are experimental and uncertain. If you knew that they’d work really well—protect everyone perfectly, no side effects, easy to produce, etc.—then you’d know with a pretty high degree of certainty that airline stocks (and cruise ships, hotels, casinos, retailers, etc.) would go up. If you knew that they’d be a disaster then you’d probably be short airlines. Meanwhile let’s say you knew with certainty that one public company’s vaccine candidate would work really well. Let’s say that company was Moderna Inc., the US biotech company that has one of the leading candidates. Would you buy Moderna stock? Having a really good vaccine would probably be profitable for Moderna. But it would be tricky. It’s a high-profile situation and there will be huge pressure—from governments and maybe even shareholders—to distribute the vaccine widely and affordably. If you make a product that lots of people want, you can charge a lot of money for it and get rich; if you make a product that everyone needs, being too greedy with it might get you in trouble. A working vaccine would be good for Moderna, but it would not be an unmixed blessing. So last week Moderna announced good news, and: Signs of progress toward a coronavirus vaccine by Moderna propelled most corners of the stock market higher. … Most of the gains followed the release of a new study suggesting Moderna had reached a breakthrough with its coronavirus vaccine, setting the stage for a larger trial at the end of this month. Cruise-ship operators, airliners and other stocks sensitive to the coronavirus crisis led the stock market higher. Shares of Moderna rose $5.18, or 6.9%, to $80.22. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was up 21.2%. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. was up 20.7%. Carnival Corp. was up 16.2%. American Airlines Group Inc. was also up 16.2%. United Airlines Holdings was up 14.6%. The biggest gainers were the vaccine-sensitive industries, not Moderna itself. We have talked about this phenomenon from various angles before but, uncharacteristically, we have not talked about it from the insider trading angle.

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Chicago carrier posted a loss of $5.79 a share, compared with profit of $1.05 billion, or $4.02 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue slumped to $1.48 billion from $11.4 billion. The earnings and revenue were better than analysts expected.

8,Is American Airlines Ready to Soar?,Is American Airlines Ready to Soar?. LATEST NEWS. Is Planet Fitness Exhausted?. Chart Wars: Tesla vs. Nikola. Fauci Says Moderna's,"Ed Ponsi  American Airlines (AAL) is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, July 23 before the opening bell. The airline is looking at a loss of about $3 billion, or $6.92 per share. That massive loss could be further inflated by possible one-time charges.  Last week, American issued 25,000 layoff notices to its employees, including 10,000 flight attendants. Airlines that receive federal CARES act funding are not permitted to lay off employees. However, that funding is set to expire on October 1st.  American was hoping that travel demand would recover by then, but that no longer appears likely. An extension of the CARES act would buy American and other airlines some badly needed time, but there's no current plan to renew it.  What do the charts tell us about the stock? Let's look at the U.S. Global Jets ETF, symbol JETS. This is a proxy for the airline industry as a whole. JETS is trading above its 50 day moving average, shown in blue.  Recently, United Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest, and Delta have all spent significant time above that indicator. But notice how American is trading below its 50 day moving average. This shows relative weakness vs. the airline sector as a whole.  This tells us that American is one of weaker airline stocks right now. A sector wide recovery would lift all airline stocks, but technically speaking, names like Spirit Airlines and JetBlue seem better positioned to lead that recovery.   Speaking of JetBlue Airlines, American announced a new partnership with New York-based carrier last week. The agreement aligns the loyalty programs of both airlines.  The plan expands American's presence in the Northeastern U.S., particularly in Boston and New York. It's a smart move by both airlines, but for American, it could be a case of too little, too late.

10,Now Is the Time to Get on Board JetBlue and JBLU Stock | InvestorPlace,Now Is the Time to Get on Board JetBlue Stock. It has been a rough ride for airline stocks but," Sometimes potential mistakes are easy to spot, as was the case on June 5 when I cautioned about chasing the airline’s rally after-the-fact. My write-up then came the day after JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) rallied 15% in one day on top of a bunch more that week. The note was prophetic since JBLU stock made a u-turn and fell 35% from what turned out to be an interim top.  My exact words were: “I don’t care how good the news was, moves this big make it impossible for me to chase in good conscience.” Today’s point is not to say I told you so, but to share my buy-the-dip idea. Near $10 per share, JBLU stock is worthy of owning in a diversified investment portfolio. Since the effects of the global quarantine are still in full bloom, airline stocks remain very high risk. I consider all of them to be speculative bets because their business processes are still in compete shambles. In June I suggested that there would be sellers from $13 through $15 per share. That happened and now it is closer to $10, so investors can start catching the falling knife, especially those intending to keep it for a while. I just traveled overseas and I saw first hand the decimation in the industry. Even though my flights were full, there were so few to choose from. In fact, they canceled my original flight to Cancun because they didn’t sell enough seats on it. Yesterday’s air traffic screening report from the TSA showed that screenings are still down 72% from this time last year. It is dangerous to chase headlines like the one that sparked the frenzy back then as it rarely works out mid-term. Today’s idea is the opposite of that and under much calmer conditions. There is no going around the fundamental thesis and the airlines profit-and-loss statements are in shambles. There is hardly any top-line flowing into JetBlue and its competitors and they are all bleeding cash. Even though they have shored up their balances, there is still tremendous pressure on their balance sheets to boot. Collectively, the airlines have raised record levels of debt in a short period of time. This is in addition to the bailouts they are getting from the government. While this increases their chances of surviving the  pinch, it does nothing to repair the business.

11,Don't Let the Turbulence in JBLU Stock Keep You From Buying a Winner | InvestorPlace,"Don’t Let the Turbulence in JetBlue Stock Keep You From Buying a Winner. JBLU stock is struggling, but there are"," Airline stocks have recovered a lot of lost ground since the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic. With every passing week, the number of domestic passengers is growing, and the markets are rewarding airlines accordingly. However, many people are wondering whether this bull run can last, considering the slow pace of our recovery. JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) is bearing the brunt of this pessimistic outlook. JBLU stock is still down almost 45% over the last six months.  However, I reiterate that JBLU stock is not a bad one for your portfolio. The carrier is consistently ranked as one of the best in customer service and came into this crisis with the second-best balance sheet in its peer group. The company and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) have recently announced a partnership that will help during the recovery period. Don’t get me wrong I know that the company is also risky, considering that it will take time for demand to return, and airlines will have to change how they operate — leading to higher costs. But on balance, there isn’t enough to suggest that JetBlue is in hot water. To protect passengers, JetBlue has launched an initiative to make sure social distancing is maintained on its flights. Steps include temperature checks, mandatory face masks for the cabin crew and passengers, and blocking specific seats within the aircraft. These initiatives are not unique to JetBlue — all major airlines are taking steps to ensure passenger safety during this time. In many ways, it was a given that this needed to happen because cruise lines and airplanes have people in close quarters for a very long time, and that’s why there was no workaround concerning these costs. However, these costs will also lead to depressed bottom lines for the foreseeable future. JetBlue stock lost a lot of value from mid-March onwards due to panic-induced selling. I believe that was a bit strange, considering the carrier went into the crisis with one of the best balance sheets in its peer group. Although the company has raised a lot of cash during the pandemic, there’s no reason to believe it will become unmanageable. At the end of May, the company had cash of $3.1 billion in its kitty. That should provide it with ample liquidity through this crisis. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE Meanwhile, cash burn is coming down.

Too,"      Nicholas Dobroruka | July 21, 2020 | More on: BB AC BB It shouldn’t come as a surprise to see Air Canada (TSX:AC) trail the Canadian market this year. Canada’s largest airline stock has dropped more than 60% since the beginning of the year, in comparison to S&P/TSX Composite Index, which is now down just 5%. Many companies have enjoyed an incredible run since the last week of March, which has only diminished my interest in picking up shares of Air Canada stock. What makes me bearish on this stock is the uncertainty that not only surrounds Air Canada, but the entire airline industry. COVID-19 cases are beginning to spike again in some parts of the world, and until we have a vaccine for the virus, I’m hard-pressed to believe we are anywhere close to seeing Air Canada return to pre-COVID-19 revenue levels.  I will admit that it’s hard to ignore the potential value play here. Trading at a price-to-book of just over 1, Air Canada is seriously undervalued. There’s also the possibility that Air Canada will emerge from this recession with an even larger market share, as smaller competitors not able to survive may be forced into declaring bankruptcy. There are definitely bull cases out there to make for Canada’s largest airline, I would just prefer to invest my money in companies that I believe have stronger growth potential. Many companies have seen its stock price surge over the past four months, and now trading at all-time highs. While BlackBerry (TSX:BB)(NYSE:BB) may have gone on an impressive run over the past couple of months, the stock is far from trading at an all-time high.  The tech company has enjoyed a run of more than 60% since the end of March. While it may be a few more years before BlackBerry is back to trading at an all-time high, I believe there’s a very real chance that the best is yet to come for this tech stock.  The $3.5 billion company once known as a top player in the smartphone industry has since made a radical change in strategy. Today, BlackBerry provides intelligent security software and services to customers across the globe.

o far in 2020, the trajectory of American Airlines’ [AAL] share price has largely mirrored that of the wider aviation industry. As the largest carrier in the US, American Airlines’ share price has set the precedent for the industry. While the peaks and troughs vary a little among the other players in America's wider airline sector, American Airlines’ share price dropped 63.15% between 21 Feb and 23 March as more and more flights were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. After a brief rebound at the end of March, its share price reached new lows at the beginning of April. More volatility followed before American Airlines’ share price finally bottomed out at $9.04 in mid-May — more than 70% off its 2020 high of $30.47. But in early June, as restrictions around travel began to ease, an industry-wide rally helped American Airlines’ share price climb 82.8% in the first eight days of the month. This included its best ever day of trading on 4 June, with the stock climbing 41% in just one day. But it soon became clear that American Airlines stock, like the wider industry, had been overbought. Up to 21 July, the share price has fallen 43.5% from that 8 June high. What will the upcoming earnings reports mean for American Airlines’ share price?     Looking to earnings Analysts are expecting American Airlines to report a big fall in sales and earnings-per-share compared with the same period in 2019. Zacks consensus estimate is that the company will report a loss an EPS loss of $6.92 for the quarter and sales are estimated to be $1.48bn.
