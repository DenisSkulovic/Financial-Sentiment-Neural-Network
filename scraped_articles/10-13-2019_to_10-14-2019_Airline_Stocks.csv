0,"4 Airline Stocks to Buy Despite Trump's Tariffs: UAL, AAL, LUV, DAL | InvestorPlace",4 Airline Stocks to Buy Despite Trump’s Tariffs. Upcoming earnings reports and the potential for tariff delays can bump these," Source: Shutterstock Airline stocks have been suffering over the past few years as bankruptcies, fluctuations in the price of oil and more recently, trade disputes and labor demands, have weighed on the sector. However, in the case of airline stocks it appears that history isn’t an indicator of the future, as the segment looks poised for a rebound.  Earlier this year the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max jet was grounded for safety reasons and although BA is working to get the plane back in the sky, there’s no way to predict how long that will take. On top of that, the latest World Trade Organization ruling gives President Donald Trump’s administration clearance to impose a tariff on European goods that would make the price of Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) aircraft 10% more expensive. That tariff is seen coming into effect Oct. 18 and consequently has weighed on the industry. Worries about rising costs are certainly founded, but the market’s knee-jerk reaction could be a great buying opportunity for value investors. Here’s a look at the top four U.S. carriers and their ability to weather this storm. 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021  At the end of December, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock fell off a cliff on the tariff news. Delta stock is down 12% from its September highs despite what appeared to be a relatively solid third-quarter earnings report. Delta’s sales were up 6.5% and the firm’s margins expanded in the third quarter. Management said revenue is seen rising by more than 5% in Q4. Worries bout the sector overall kept investors focused on the fact that the earnings per share forecast was below expectations. And DAL stock suffered. It’s true that Delta’s costs are going up. Aside from the impact of Trump’s tariffs, Delta is also dealing with pay increases and rising maintenance costs that will hurt the Q4 results. DAL stock is also likely to be one of the hardest hit by the Airbus tariff — the firm had 254 outstanding orders with Airbus at the end of August. However there’s still a chance that the tariffs will be renegotiated, or at least delayed, in the days to come. Dr. Tenpao Lee, an economics professor at Niagara University said in an email interview that tariffs ultimately worsen conditions for both sides. He believes the trade tension with Europe is fundamentally different from what’s happening with","Oct 14, 2019",https://investorplace.com/2019/10/airline-stocks-to-buy-trump-tariffs-wto/
1,3 Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Goldman Sachs,. . . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY.,"                                                   Undervalued stocks are nothing new on Wall Street. And Goldman Sachs making a bullish call to defend a company’s shares is not exactly news either. But combine the two and add in price charts that confirm a bottom, and it’s clear that there’s plenty of potential in some underloved stocks. Specifically, I’m talking about the diversified and superior potential in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN). There are bulls in investing and then there’s Goldman Sachs. One of the market’s most storied investment firms certainly maintains reasons for being generally optimistic in its market calls. That’s not to say Goldman isn’t making prop side bets or that it’s always bullish. But when it comes to paying customers, underwriting and the likes, a bull market is good for business. Given how this well-oiled machine operates, a buy recommendation from Goldman isn’t exactly a rarity. Nevertheless, when the firm’s chief U.S. strategist acknowledges major market headwinds, but sees superior upside potential in several undervalued stocks — such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) — with 50% or more upside, it’s time to take notice.

With that said, let’s dive a little deeper into what makes AAL, UAA and REGN stock worth a buy. As most investors may be aware, AAL stock has been left behind over the past few years while the broader market has continued to rally to all-time-highs. Shares are also down several percentage points since Goldman’s initial call. But now AAL looks ready to take-off!

2,3 Stocks Warren Buffett Was Wrong About | The Motley Fool,3 Stocks Warren Buffett Was Wrong About. Even the greatest investors have their off days.. 1. ConocoPhillips. 2. USAir. 3.,"   This article was first published by MyWallSt. Do you want access to 25 years of market-beating experience in one day? Find out more about MyWallSt's exclusive InPerson November event! Though the Oracle of Omaha is widely considered to be the greatest investor of all time, even he managed to make a few mistakes. Here's a look at three of them. Warren Buffett's decision to buy a large stake in multinational energy conglomerate ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) was not a mistake because he bought it, but rather that he bought the stock at the wrong price. The general idea was that Buffett was making a play for future energy prices, with many believing that oil prices would only increase over the long term. However, this did not play out. IMAGE SOURCE: UNSPLASH. ConocoPhillips was Buffett's way of benefiting from the expected jump in oil prices. The company was and still is very successful, but buying stocks in a great company does not make a great investment. Since crude oil prices were well over $100 a barrel at the time (2008), oil company stocks were already way up. Buffett lost roughly $2 billion as he bought the shares for $7 billion despite only being worth $4.4 billion.  Buffett put this poor investment down to getting swept up in the excitement surrounding oil prices at the time. A more detached investor might have recognized that the price of crude oil has always exhibited tremendous volatility and that oil companies have long been subject to boom and bust cycles. Back in 1989, airline stocks were gaining popularity and none more so than USAir. (The company changed its name to US Airways in the 1990s and later merged with Amercian Airlines.) Buffett bought into this airline, which had achieved tremendous revenue growth since its founding 50 years earlier. Buffett purchased $358 million of USAir preferred stock with 9.25% dividend, mandatory redemption in 10 years, and right to convert into common at $60 a share. The investment quickly turned sour, as USAir didn't achieve enough revenue to pay the dividends due on his stock, and approached bankruptcy. Only down to a stroke of luck, Buffett was able to offload his shares at a small profit at a later date. Buffett still regrets his first foray into the airline industry to this day. In a 2007 letter to shareholders, he stated that he bought the","Oct 14, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/14/3-stocks-warren-buffett-was-wrong-about.aspx
3,Spirit Airlines Stock Rebounds on Better-Than-Feared Guidance Update | The Motley Fool,"Spirit Airlines Stock Rebounds on Better-Than-Feared Guidance Update. Spirit Airlines stock has been beaten down over the past few months,","   In late July, Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) provided a disappointing forecast for the third quarter of 2019, implying that its profit margin would contract and adjusted earnings per share would be roughly flat year over year, despite the airline's double-digit capacity growth. The airline's forecast got even worse in an early September guidance update, primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Dorian. As a result, Spirit Airlines stock plunged by about 40% between late July and early October. Fortunately, Spirit performed better in September than it had expected at the beginning of the month. As a result, the company was able to improve its Q3 forecast late last week. That news sent Spirit Airlines stock soaring as much as 11% on Friday, before ending the day with a 6% gain.  SPIRIT AIRLINES STOCK YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. Spirit Airlines grew revenue per available seat mile (RASM) 4.5% year over year in the first half of 2019, while managing its costs well. As a result, adjusted EPS soared 63% to $2.53. By contrast, management's initial guidance for the third quarter called for RASM to be roughly flat year over year -- plus or minus 1% -- and for nonfuel unit costs to surge 7% to 8% due to a runway closure in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and poor operational performance. (Spirit's recent downturn in operational performance has been driven by an unfortunate combination of aggressive scheduling and frequent severe weather events.) Spirit Airlines reduced its forecast further in early September, after Hurricane Dorian added to its woes. At that time, the company said that it expected a 2.5% to 3.5% RASM decline and a 9% to 10% increase in nonfuel unit costs for the quarter. Based on that guidance, analysts were recently projecting that Spirit's EPS could be as low as $1.05 in Q3, down from $1.47 a year earlier. Three months ago, the average analyst estimate stood at $1.84. On Thursday afternoon, Spirit Airlines improved its third-quarter forecast significantly. The company said that RASM fell by about 2% last quarter -- worse than its initial outlook but ahead of its updated guidance -- as Hurricane Dorian did not disrupt bookings as much as expected. SPIRIT AIRLINES IMPROVED ITS THIRD-QUARTER FORECAST LAST WEEK. IMAGE SOURCE: SPIRIT AIRLINES. Additionally, Spirit said that adjusted nonfuel unit costs rose by about 8.5%. This, too, was worse than its original forecast but","Oct 14, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/14/spirit-airlines-stock-rebounds-on-better-than-fear.aspx

8,Is Deutsche Lufthansa AG (ETR:LHA) Investing Your Capital Efficiently? - Simply Wall St News,"Is Deutsche Lufthansa AG (ETR:LHA) Investing Your Capital Efficiently?. Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?. So, How Do","Today we'll look at Deutsche Lufthansa AG (ETR:LHA) and reflect on its potential as an investment. To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business. First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE. ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'. The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) Or for Deutsche Lufthansa: 0.081 = €2.0b ÷ (€43b - €18b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.) Therefore, Deutsche Lufthansa has an ROCE of 8.1%. See our latest analysis for Deutsche Lufthansa ROCE can be useful when making comparisons, such as between similar companies. We can see Deutsche Lufthansa's ROCE is meaningfully below the Airlines industry average of 11%. This could be seen as a negative, as it suggests some competitors may be employing their capital more efficiently. Aside from the industry comparison, Deutsche Lufthansa's ROCE is mediocre in absolute terms, considering the risk of investing in stocks versus the safety of a bank account. Readers may find more attractive investment prospects elsewhere. You can see in the image below how Deutsche Lufthansa's ROCE compares to its industry. When considering this metric, keep in mind that it is backwards looking, and not necessarily predictive. ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. Since the future is so important for investors, you should check out our free report on analyst forecasts for Deutsche Lufthansa.

By Stuart Todd 6 June 2008 South African-based cargo airline African International Airways, which operates two McDonnell Douglas DC-8 freighters, has been put up for sale. African International shareholder Alan Stocks tells flightglobal.com's affiliate ATI: “Myself and business partner, Bernard Keay, are contemplating retirement and this is the main reason for the sale.” Stocks adds that some expressions of interest have been shown in the carrier but declines to comment further. African International started operations in 1985 in Swaziland and went on to provide supplementary capacity on behalf of scheduled airlines, including more than a decade of flying for Alitalia and several years in the service of British Airways World Cargo. It was reorganised in 1988 after Intavia took a stake in the company with a refocus on worldwide cargo charter flights.  Shipments transported have included security paper, fresh produce, flowers, auto parts, humanitarian relief cargo for governments and the UN. Today, AIA’s core business is in the niche market for the carriage of bloodstock. “A recent flight carried a shipment of cattle from Johannesburg to Nigeria and other flights carry horses and polo ponies into South Africa from South America and Australia,” Stocks says.

Warren Buffett has made a fortune by putting his money to work in the stock market, but it looks like he is now afraid that a crash could be in the cards. The Oracle of Omaha has been going cash-heavy and is pulling out of stocks, indicating that the legendary investor might be bracing for a stock market crash. Billionaire Warren Buffett Is Predicting a Stock Market Crash; Is He Right? https://t.co/kEq57EF9Ob — CCN – Capital & Celeb News (@CapitalAndCeleb) October 9, 2019  But what if I told you that there are three stocks that could help Warren Buffett reap rich returns in case a recession arrives next year and sends the stock market into meltdown mode? AutoZone, Dollar Tree, and Ross Stores are three names that you – and Warren Buffett – should own before the next stock market crash begins. Let’s see why. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the last recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. During this period, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed nearly 40 percent. But AutoZone stood tall amid the stock market crash and gained 46 percent, and that was not surprising given the business the company is into.

11,"After a Turbulent Year, Boeing Stock Looks Primed to Gain Some Altitude - RealMoney","After a Turbulent Year, Boeing Stock Looks Primed to Gain Some Altitude. Airbus has risen twice as much in 2019","The more things change with Boeing (BA) , the more they seem to stay the same. The company keeps kicking the can that is the 737 Max fiasco further and further down the road. United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) have canceled 737 Max flights until at least January, while Southwest (LUV) foresees grounding trouble jet into 2020 as well. That puts Boeing's marquee jet on the ground for at least nine months since the second of two fatal crashes raised questions about the 737 Max's safety. Of course, the big winner in all of this has been Airbus (EADSY) . Boeing's net orders were down by 84 jets through 2019's first nine months vs. a 127-plane gain for Airbus. But somehow, Airbus stock has actually underperformed Boeing share since March 11, the day after the second of two fatal 737 Max crashes. True, Airbus was higher by 10% in July while Boeing was down double-digits by mid-August. But the action in Airbus is more concerning than what we've seen in Boeing, and I believe once the 737 Max takes back to the air, Airbus's tumble will continue. Keep in mind that Airbus has rallied 34% year to date -- twice as much Boeing. (Yes, despite the 737 Max mess, BA is still actually up roughly 17% YTD.) However, most of both stocks' gains came in 2019's first two months. The first 737 Max tragedy (Lion Air) occurred last fall, but BA still enjoyed a big rally before a second crash (Ethiopian Airlines) in March. Boeing retraced its early 2019 rally after that, while Airbus held on to its gains. My view is once the 737 Max gets fixed and becomes airborne again, we'll see a reversion to the mean, with Boeing stock regaining ground. That doesn't necessarily mean that Boeing will rise while Airbus falls. They both could fall, but Boeing might fall less. Or they both could rise, but Boeing would rise more. Or, the two stocks might meet somewhere in the middle. Assuming the 737 Max gets off the ground in January or February, this scenario could lead to a 10% outperformance by Boeing relative to Airbus during 2020's first half. But if the 737 Max's grounding drags into March -- putting its time out of service to a full year -- then that outperformance will get kicked further down the road. Meanwhile, Boeing appears to","Oct 14, 2019",https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/boeing-stock-looks-primed-to-gain-some-altitude-15125558
12,Qantas Airways (ASX:QAN) Takes On Some Risk With Its Use Of Debt - Simply Wall St News,Qantas Airways (ASX:QAN) Takes On Some Risk With Its Use Of Debt. What Risk Does Debt Bring?. How Much Debt,"The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Qantas Airways Limited (ASX:QAN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky. Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Qantas Airways The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Qantas Airways had debt of AU$3.98b at the end of June 2019, a reduction from AU$4.75b over a year. However, it does have AU$2.16b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about AU$1.83b. We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Qantas Airways had liabilities of AU$8.58b falling due within a year, and liabilities of AU$7.37b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of AU$2.16b and AU$1.10b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling AU$12.7b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined. When you consider that this deficiency exceeds the company's AU$9.82b market capitalization, you might well be inclined to review the balance sheet intently. Hypothetically, extremely heavy dilution would be required if the company were forced to pay down its liabilities by raising capital at the current share price. We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover","Oct 14, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/transportation/asx-qan/qantas-airways-shares/news/qantas-airways-asxqan-takes-on-some-risk-with-its-use-of-debt
13,Norwegian Airlines Doubles Down On US Market And Its Own Survival By Adding Flights,MORE FROM FORBES. Norwegian Airlines Doubles Down On US Market And Its Own Survival By Adding Flights. 3 Takeaways For,"AIRPORT FIUMICINO, ROME, ITALY - 2018/09/02: Norwegian Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner landing at Rome ... [+]  For Norwegian Airlines, perhaps the largest long-haul low-cost airline still operating, the American leisure traveler has always been a key demographic. Now Norwegian is doubling down on the U.S. market by adding additional flights from many US cities to popular European destinations. Norwegian, which flew 37 million people in 2018, will add frequency to U.S. long-haul routes to many cities in Europe. For example, the airline is increasing the number of Los Angeles-Paris flights to 10 per week. The airline had previously been flying the popular route daily; the new schedule will add flights twice on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Norwegian will now fly New York-Paris to 9 times per week, up from daily, and San Francisco-London daily, up from five times per week. Routes such as Los Angeles-Barcelona; Los Angeles-Madrid; Tampa-London, San Francisco-Barcelona; Austin-London; Fort Lauderdale-Oslo,Denver-London; Los Angeles-Rome and Boston-Paris will also enjoy a beefed-up flight schedule. PROMOTED “Our nonstop routes to Paris, London and Barcelona have been in very high demand by American and European travelers alike, and we continue to bolster capacity to meet the demand. Paris, in particular, now served by seven U.S. gateways, has seen rapid growth in recent years and we see potential for more,” said Matthew Wood, SVP Commercial at Norwegian. Norwegian’s enhanced European schedule is set for the summer 2020 season. The announcement of the aggressive summer schedule seems designed to quiet persistent doubts about the airline’s long-term survival, and show that Norwegian remains a strong contender. Norwegian, named World’s Best Low-Cost Long-Haul Airline for the past five years by SkyTrax, is a popular budget alternative to the traditional carriers. In fact, Norwegian has grown to be the largest foreign airline in New York City. The budget carrier is also the largest airline in terms of European flights from both the Bay Area and Los Angeles, as well as Florida. Many of these flights are served with its modern long-range Boeing 787 Dreamliners. LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 06: Norwegian Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner at LAX on February 06, 2017 in Los ...

Guess who,"Stocks once again traded lower this week after a chaotic week of trade war headlines and negotiations between the United States and China ultimately resulted in little concrete progress. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 took a hit on reports the White House is considering limiting government pension investments in Chinese stocks. The Trump administration has previously denied reports it plans to limit U.S. investment in China. On Wednesday, reports that China is open to a partial trade deal sent stocks higher. Shortly thereafter, the South China Morning Post reported that deputy-level U.S.-Sino trade negotiations made “no progress.” On Thursday, President Donald Trump confirmed he would be meeting with China’s Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Friday, quashing reports that Liu would be returning to China on Thursday evening. Despite a lack of progress in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, investors got some potentially good news on Brexit deal negotiations on Thursday. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said they could both see a “pathway to a possible deal” ahead of the looming Brexit deadline of Oct. 31. Despite a third-quarter earnings beat, Delta Airline’s stock traded lower on disappointing fourth-quarter guidance. Apple shares were higher on the week after encouraging iPhone 11 sales data prompted Longbow Research to upgrade the stock and Canaccord Genuity to raise its price target by 8.3%. Federal Reserve meeting minutes revealed “a few participants” at the September meeting argued the markets are pricing in greater future accommodative measures than appropriate. This week, third-quarter earnings season gets into full swing with reports from the big U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup on Tuesday and Bank of America on Wednesday. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said between the low-rate environment and slowing economic growth around the world, he’s expecting more of the same from the banks this earnings season. He’s hoping one CEO in particular can strike a positive note. “Jamie Dimon had a positive outlook last quarter. He’s kind of the dean of the group. His confidence is incredibly important, and you want to hear him strike a positive note that a slowdown in Europe and Asia is not impacting results.” Overall, Kinahan is excited that earnings season will give the market a break from the trade war. “That’s why I can’t wait for earnings season,” he said. “We actually","Oct 13, 2019",https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2019/10/13/stock-market-us-china-trade-war/3942408002/
15,INSIDE DETAILS! What Turkish Airlines is doing with IndiGo to spread wings in India | Zee Business,INSIDE DETAILS! What Turkish Airlines is doing with IndiGo to spread wings in India. Global passenger carrier Turkish Airlines wants," In an effort to spread its wings in India and tap into the rising transfer passenger traffic from the country, global passenger carrier Turkish Airlines wants to expand its codeshare agreement with the largest domestic player IndiGo.  What is codeshare agreement? How does it help?  A codeshare agreement allows two airlines to sell seats on each others' flights in order to provide passengers with a wider choice of destinations. The Istanbul-based airline is in a unique position as it not only has a codeshare agreement with IndiGo, but also with Air India. The airline has commenced talks with IndiGo over the possibility of enhancing their present agreement, which was reached in 2018.  Turkish Airlines-IndiGo codeshare pact The current codeshare and mutual cooperation agreements between Turkish Airlines and IndiGo enables passengers of both the carriers to fly to various destinations in India, Turkey and beyond. Significantly, the agreement has been beneficial for Turkish Airlines, as it gets a healthy traffic flow from IndiGo for its extensive network in Europe. Nonetheless, the enhanced agreement might see addition of other European destinations, including London, along with routes from Istanbul to the US East Coast. New Delhi-Istabbul flights On the other hand, it is expected that out of the two daily flights from New Delhi to Istanbul, IndiGo might start one service from another Indian city. At present, Turkish Airlines operates 14 times a week to both New Delhi and Mumbai from Istanbul, while IndiGo operates two daily services between Delhi and Istanbul. IndiGo had commenced its services to Istanbul earlier this year. Turkish Airlines Turkish Airlines has over 300 passenger and cargo aircraft flying to more than 300 destinations worldwide. The airline launched its operations in India with flights to New Delhi in 2003 and to Mumbai in 2006. IndiGo On its part, IndiGo has a fleet of over 240 aircraft and offers almost 1,500 daily flights connecting 60 domestic and 23 international destinations.

We are ready to extend any type of co-operation.""

18,Air India privatisation: Govt to make national airline debt-free before sale - The Financial Express,"Air India privatisation: Govt to make national airline debt-free before sale. As on March 31, 2019, AI’s debt and other","The Centre will likely make the ailing Air India (AI) virtually debt-free by taking over an additional Rs 20,000 crore from its books before offering it afresh to bidders by the end of this month. The government had taken over Rs 29,464-crore of AI debt earlier this financial year through a special purpose vehicle (SPV). AI’s assets, largely its fleet of aircraft, are estimated to be about Rs 20,000 crore, equivalent to the residual debt to be taken over by the prospective buyer, along with the entire government stake in the airline. As on March 31, 2019, AI’s debt and other liabilities had stood close to Rs 70,000 crore. With the debt overhang over, the much-anticipated AI privatisation might materialise this year and contribute a substantial amount to the Centre’s disinvestment receipts. The premium bilateral rights owned by the national carrier are what the prospective buyer will have to really pay for. AI’s assets include a fleet of 128 aircraft and its valuable bilateral flying rights, landing rights and parking slots at airports across the world. Air India owns 70 planes, including wide-body Boeing 787-800 Dreamliners, and the remaining planes are on lease. It is expected that a foreign airline may tie-up with an Indian airline/investor to bid for the national carrier. The current FDI rules allow foreign airlines to buy up to 49% stake in domestic carriers. AI is surviving on taxpayer bailouts after losing money continuously since FY08 after the merger of the erstwhile Indian Airlines with Air India. While efforts have been made to revive the airline in the past, AI has not reported a profit in at least a decade; in FY16 it posted an operating profit of Rs 105 crore and reduced its net loss to Rs 3,837 crore compared with Rs 5,859 crore in FY15 and a whopping Rs 7,635-crore loss in FY19. Retaining the airline in its fold is a much more expensive proposition for the government than transferring the ownership. To enable the sale, the government would require to infuse amounts much higher than the Rs 50,000 crore proposed under a revival plan for AI, which entails it to continue as state-run entity. The Centre has already infused about Rs 30,000 crore in the airline over the past seven years. In June last year, the government called off the proposed sale of 76% stake in AI after no buyer showed interest.
