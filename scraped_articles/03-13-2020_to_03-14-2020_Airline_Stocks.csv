On a price/earnings basis they appear cheap—Delta trades at 5.6 times earnings, while United and American go for less than four times earnings. But airlines have been cheap for the entire bull market, so those numbers really don’t matter. “With the positive airline story uncertain or even broken, there likely is no supportive valuation metric for investors,” says Helane Becker, a veteran industry analyst with Cowen.

2,Airline stocks rebound on hopes for financial relief from the coronavirus impact,"Airline stocks soar on hopes for financial relief from coronavirus, Delta up 13%. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Shares of major U.S. airlines got a respite Friday on expectations that the government will provide targeted financial relief from the coronavirus impact.  Delta Air Lines climbed 13.7%, American Airlines jumped 6.3%, and United Airlines climbed more than 12%. Airlines are among the hardest-hit industries due to the travel restrictions to slow down the spreading of the novel coronavirus. Major airlines have cut domestic and international flights because of the dented demand.  The stock market rallied on Friday after suffering its worst day since the “Black Monday” in 1987. Investors grew more optimistic that economic relief in response to the outbreak is on the horizon. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said U.S. lawmakers and the White House were close to a stimulus deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said the airline industry is among the priorities of the government. He said airlines face a similar situation to the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. He also listed cruise lines, hotels and small business in general. Cruise line stocks also soared on Friday, with Carnival and Norwegian up 17% and 15%. Trading of these two stocks was halted in morning trading due to heightened volatility.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   Warren Buffett likes airline stocks despite the recent dramatic sell off so don’t expect Buffett to dump his shares. “I won’t be selling airline stocks,” he told Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer this week. According to recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) holds large stakes in several airlines: more than 53 million shares of Southwest (LUV), 42 million shares of American (AAL), 21.9 million shares of United (UAL), and 71.8 million shares of Delta (DAL) after buying almost a million new shares two weeks ago. Berkshire Hathaway purchased the additional 976,000 shares of Delta at about $46 a share on February 27th. At the close of trading Thursday March 12th, Delta shares had fallen roughly 27.5% in just two weeks driven down by coronavirus related cuts in capacity and reservations. “Well, it’s going to be terrible. I’ve always felt a pandemic would happen at some time,” Buffett said. He’s long suspected a pandemic could interrupt progress in the United States and globally. But Buffett predicts ultimately, “It won’t stop the progress of the country or the world.” United Airlines President and incoming CEO Scott Kirby recently told investors, “Our current dire scenario planning option is for revenue to be down 70% in April.” While he doesn’t expect the revenue hit to actually be that bad, he says United’s goal is to “raise liquidity, cut capex, and reduce capacity to position ourselves to bounce back when the crisis ends.” But Kirby made those predictions a day before President Trump announced travel restrictions on passengers flying from Europe to the United States. Analysts at Stifel in a note published March 12th advised clients, “we view that dire revenue scenario as more likely.” Delta CEO Ed Bastian says North America accounts for 1/5th of the global airline market but 2/3rds of the profits. The Stifel analysts wrote, “We expect the travel restrictions to have a greater financial impact on the European airline industry rather than the U.S.”                  ","Mar 13, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-i-wont-be-selling-airline-stocks-142849303.html

As of January 7, 2021, you will be redirected to Reuters.com. Learn more about these changes here. Discover Thomson Reuters By Marcelo Rochabrun 4 MIN READ SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The airline stocks that suffered the most after U.S. President Donald Trump barred continental Europeans from traveling to the United States do not even operate flights between those two regions. Brazil's largest airline, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, GOLL4.SA and its smaller rival, Azul SA AZUL.N, saw their shares tumble over 30% on Thursday, a record for each. Year to date, both companies' New York-traded shares are down more than 70%. To be sure, the world’s top 20 airlines’ shares are all deep in the red this year. But the two Brazilian carriers’ share price losses are in a league of their own. It may seem surprising at first glance, because both are focused on domestic flights within Brazil and only Azul operates direct routes to the United States or Europe. Neither operates flights to Asia. In other words, they are not directly exposed to the worst travel disruptions. But analysts say their negative performance is tied to Brazil’s broader economic woes and to a general panic over riskier, more volatile shares. “You may have portfolio managers with clients who want their money back now,” said Stephen Trent, an analyst at Citigroup. “Emerging markets are risky, and airlines are riskier than other assets. There’s not a huge connection to their fundamentals.” In addition, Brazil’s currency, the real, is the world’s fourth worst performing so far this year, a key pressure point for emerging market carriers who pay many fees in dollars. “Anytime that the dollar goes up, that affects (over half) of our costs,” said Eduardo Sanovicz, who heads Brazil’s airline industry group ABEAR. “It’s not a positive thing.” And no major stock exchange has fallen more than Brazil’s so far this year. Refinitiv data shows that Gol and Azul have been traded more than average in recent days. “Gol and Azul are super liquid shares,” said Azul’s CEO John Rodgerson on Thursday. “And they are being used that way.” But the carriers’ negative performance also highlights that the airline business in Brazil has struggled for years to be profitable, weighed down by a","Mar 13, 2020",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil-airlines-an/why-brazilian-airline-shares-are-hardest-hit-by-the-coronavirus-panic-idUKKBN2101GG
6,The Extreme Distress of Airline Stocks as Shown in Three Charts,. . . . . . . . . . . . . BloombergQuint. The Extreme Distress of Airline Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Airlines are arguably among the hardest hit sectors in the global coronavirus pandemic as they are highly exposed to travel restrictions and have a strong correlation to the state of the overall economy. Earlier this week, multiple U.S. airlines said they would cut capacity and withdrew their forecasts for the year. Then matters took a worse turn Wednesday when U.S. President Donald Trump said he will significantly restrict travel from Europe for the next 30 days. Meanwhile, cities and companies have continued to encourage working remotely and conferences, entertainment and sporting events have been shut down. “At this point, we see duration as the biggest factor in a potential recovery versus intensity of the virus,” Cowen analyst Helane Becker wrote in a note, adding that there are similarities with the demand-shocked environment that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Read more: World’s Airlines Savaged Anew by Trump Travel Clampdown The pain facing airline stocks can be summed up in these three charts: The nine-member S&P Supercomposite Airlines Industry Index has never before seen a plunge this deep and quick. As the chart shows, all the prior drops of comparable or bigger magnitude took much longer to play out. On Thursday, the index sank as much as 17%, its biggest intraday drop since September 2001. The top decliners were SkyWest, United, Hawaiian and Delta. While airlines around the world are feeling the pain, shares of U.S. carriers are taking the biggest hit. The S&P Supercomposite Airlines index has fallen 43% over the past six months. The widespread meltdown that is threatening to tip the world into an economic recession has also changed some familiar rules, at least for now. Jet fuel has historically been one of the biggest costs for the aviation industry, which is why airline stocks and oil prices are typically on an opposite trajectory - when oil goes up, airline shares suffer, and vice versa. However, the massive crash in oil since Saudi Arabia kicked off a price war last weekend hasn’t bolstered airline shares, suggesting uncertainties about the virus outbreak are now the biggest investor concern. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

(NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B), helped propel markets from their two-year lows.  According to the Aggregated Portfolio of Gurus, a Premium feature, four airline stocks with high guru ownership include Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE:DAL), Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE:ALK), Spirit Airlines Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) and Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV). U.S. government announces stimulus deal, targeting airlines like Berkshire’s Delta House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said U.S. lawmakers and the While House were near a stimulus deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin added that the airline industry is “among the priorities of the government.” Mnuchin also said airlines are facing a situation like was seen after Sept. 11, 2011. On the heels of the stimulus deal, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 23,185.62, up 1,985 points or 9.36% from Thursday’s close of 21,200.62. The 30-stock index recovered all but 367.60 points from Thursday’s monster drop, which sent the Dow close to the December 2018 lows.  As such, investors might seek opportunities in airline stocks broadly owned by our value investing gurus.

Look for,"March 13, 2020 7:00 PM GMT+2      Subscribe to Fortune’s Outbreak newsletter for a daily roundup of stories on the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on global business. Let’s be clear: Unless it’s absolutely necessary, you’re probably not getting on an airplane anytime soon. The reach of the new coronavirus, a.k.a. the COVID-19 virus, is expanding by the minute, not only infecting people—more than 133,000 worldwide, at the time of this writing—but also affecting the way we travel, with some countries on lockdown (Italy), others not accepting those with foreign passports (India), and President Trump suspending travel from Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, to the U.S. for 30 days.  That said, if you’re willing to bet that—like every pandemic to date—this, too, shall pass, then it’s a great time to book future travel. Airline stocks are down, many of the flights that are in the air are close to empty, and mileage redemption deals abound. Below, Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of The Points Guy, an online how-to guide for maximizing airline miles and credit card points, shares his advice for availing yourself of deals now in hopes of kicking back, sans face mask and hand sanitizer, in the months ahead. “As much as I want to be on the front lines saying it’s fine to travel, right now, it’s not ideal,” says Kelly. “I think things will start rebounding over the summer.” “There has, frankly, never been a better time to redeem miles at the low ‘saver’ level,” says Kelly. “If you’ve got miles, and you’ve been dreaming of going to Australia, now is the time to go the website of your carrier of choice and look for deals. It’s just like the stock market—when there’s fear, that’s the best time to get in. You can even book 11 months in advance. For January and February 2021, we’re seeing a lot of availability on routes where it’s normally tough to get award tickets: New York to Singapore, for example.” Nick Ewen, a senior editor at The Points Guy, also notes that some airlines that are typically stingy with their business-class awards, like United, are opening up historic amounts of inventory. Take United’s nonstop flights from Chicago-O’Hare to Frankfurt, Germany, in July and August: 50 of the 62 days have business-class awards for up to eight passengers, which, he says, “is unheard","Mar 13, 2020",https://fortune.com/2020/03/13/coronavirus-flights-airfares-refunds-buy-tickets-now/
