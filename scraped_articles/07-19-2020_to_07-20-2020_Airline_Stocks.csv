2,When Will the Airline Stocks Recover? | The Motley Fool,When Will the Airline Stocks Recover?. 2020 has been turbulent for airlines. Will the airways calm in the second half,"   Airlines were hammered in the coronavirus market downturn, which caught the attention of contrarians and deep-value investors. Many people felt like geniuses for buying on the dip ahead of a May rally, but the plot has since thickened with much of those gains being erased. Shares of Delta Air Lines are down 55% year to date, while American Airlines dropped 60%, United Airlines has fallen 64%, and Southwest has managed to relatively shine at a mere 38% decline. Long-term investors should consider the evolving industry fundamentals and compare these to historical figures. What results do the airlines need to report to demonstrate true recovery? Air travel nearly came to a complete halt in April, and the resulting revenue shock fueled worries that large carriers would be unable to meet their monthly debt and lease obligations. Bankruptcy threats are usually enough to rattle cages in the stock market, and that certainly held true in this case. The JETS ETF (NYSEMKT:JETS) dropped from $32 in February to $12 in March, far outpacing major indices. The ETF was volatile for several weeks following the low, before a rally pushed shares as high as $22 in May. That joy was short-lived, as JETS has since dipped to $16. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Preliminary data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics indicates that airline passenger volume fell 96% year over year for the month of April, following a 51% drop in March. Major airlines carried 3 million passengers in April, the lowest monthly total in the 45 years of industrywide data tracking. This has obvious implications for top lines across the industry. Major U.S. airlines generate roughly 75% of revenues from passenger fares, while baggage fees, upgrade and itinerary change fees, and cargo represent the remainder of revenue. No business can casually absorb multiple months of lost revenues, but airlines are especially vulnerable in this scenario. These companies have significant fixed expenses and cash outflows due to their business models and capital structures.  Airlines generally maintain narrow margins. Industry average operating margins were around 7% in 2019, with net profit margins around 4% to 5%, so a 10% decline in revenue could wipe out profits entirely. Some major expenses for airlines will decline with lower volumes, such as fuel costs, which represented about 20% of total operating expenses in 2019. Nonetheless, labor costs make up 35% of total expenses, and it's","Jul 19, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/19/when-will-the-airline-stocks-recover/

Good evening, Bull Sheeters. This is Fortune finance reporter Rey Mashayekhi, filling in this week for Bernhard Warner with a special PM edition of the newsletter.   The airline industry‚Äôs hopes for a steady post-COVID recovery have been dealt a blow with the news that U.S. air travel is once again slipping. The total number of people who passed through checkpoints at U.S. airports fell last week for the first time since April, indicating more pain in the cards for carriers as the coronavirus‚Äôs spread continues to scare off travelers. Airline stocks reflected such fears on Monday, with the major publicly-traded names all taking a sizable hit. Delta, which is looking to cut pilots‚Äô guaranteed minimum pay, and Southwest, where nearly 17,000 employees have signed up for buyouts and partially paid leaves of absence, each fell more than 3%. American‚Äôs stock dropped nearly 4%, and United shares lost almost 5% of their value. That‚Äôs bad news for investors who were hoping to capitalize on a beaten-up sector‚Äîone presumably primed for a rebound should a successful COVID-19 vaccine be developed and/or the virus be brought under control. But with cases in the U.S. continuing to escalate, and even the most advanced vaccine candidates still in the trial stage, that ‚Äúdip‚Äù appears to have evolved into a longer, lingering rut with no clear end in sight. *** That‚Äôs all for today.

Suddenly, they‚Äôre having second thoughts ‚Äì and racing for the exits. By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. Millennials have fallen out of love with airline stocks. After retail investors piled into the sector in late May and early June, the tide suddenly turned. Share prices are falling, and Robinhood traders are rapidly jumping ship. This reversal follows a resurgence of the pandemic in the U.S., and it precedes a slew of earnings reports from domestic carriers. Neither promises airline stock investors positive news. The growing number of cases has raised the prospect of further curbs on air travel. And the quarterly results are expected to expose staggering losses. Airline stocks took a brutal plunge in March. By mid-May, it looked like the worst was over for the sector. The JETS ETF ‚Äì  an index fund that tracks the air travel industry ‚Äì started to rally. It was up nearly 90% off its lows by early June. As airline stocks staged a recovery, Robinhood‚Äôs army of millennial investors started piling in. (The platform‚Äôs median user is 31.)

6,Fasten Your Seat Belts. Airlines Are About to Disclose Their Losses. | Barron's,Fasten Your Seat Belts. Airlines Are About to Disclose Their Losses.. Jets sit idle at McCarran International Airport near Las,"  Airline stocks are likely to be more turbulent than usual this week. Several carriers are set to report second-quarter results. And the outlook for the industry appears to be worsening with the rise in coronavirus cases. As cases rise sharply, airlines are once again paring back on flight schedules. Delta Air Lines (ticker: DAL) cut another 8% off its schedule in August and cut 16% of its international flights, according to the Cranky Flier blog. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Allegiant Travel (ALGT) have also reduced their schedules, while Southwest (LUV) is one of the few airlines adding flights for August and September. Fare prices, meanwhile, appear to be falling. According to Cowen‚Äôs fare tracker, domestic fares averaged $296 for the week ending July 13, down 2.2% week-over-week, and sliding from a peak of $324 in the week ended June 15. A stall in the recovery is also showing up in passenger checkpoint data. The number of travelers passing through security checkpoints was down 74% for the week ending July 16, essentially flat with the prior week at a 73% decline, compared with 2019 levels, according to data from the Transportation Security Administration. Seven companies are set to report second-quarter results this week, starting Tuesday with United Airlines Holdings (ticker: UAL) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU). The low-cost carriers Spirit and Allegiant report on Wednesday. On Thursday, it will be American Airlines Group (AAL), Alaska Air Group (ALK), and Southwest‚Äôs turns. None of the airlines is expected to report a profit.

July 20, 2020  If you‚Äôve listened in to some of my interviews or online presentations since the start of the pandemic, you may have heard me discuss Robinhood, the no-commission trading app favored by millennials. According to the company, the median age of users is 31. Many are first-time investors. In the first quarter, the startup reported that some 2 million new accounts were opened, which was more than Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E*Trade combined. For some investing veterans, the narrative has been that Robinhooders are clueless kids living in their parents‚Äô basements, whose haphazard day-trading has destabilized stock prices. They took their $1,200 pandemic relief checks (which contributed to record disposable income growth in April) and loaded up on tech stocks, making markets frothy, some might say.   click to enlarge I won‚Äôt make the case that there‚Äôs no truth to this characterization. Tech stocks are indeed among the biggest movers so far this year, with electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla and teleconferencing app Zoom on top. Not only has the rally made Tesla CEO Elon Musk $41.2 billion richer this year, but the combined market caps of the ‚ÄúBig 5‚Äù tech firms (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Facebook) now account for more than 21 percent of the total market cap of the S&P Composite 1500. click to enlarge A recent Bank of America survey, in fact, found that three quarters of fund managers believe tech stocks are the ‚Äúmost crowded‚Äù trade in history. As if to underline this belief, as many as 40,000 Robinhood accounts added shares of Tesla during a single four-hour period last Monday, according to Bloomberg. (According to third-party Robintrack.net, which compiles trading activity data on Robinhood, Tesla was the second-most popular stock of the past week, following biotech firm Moderna, which released promising results of an experimental coronavirus vaccine last week.)

9,LUV Stock: Southwest Airlines Has a Credibility Issue Ahead of Earnings | InvestorPlace,Southwest Airlines Has a Credibility Issue Ahead of Q2 Earnings. The airline industry‚Äôs flip-flopping may end up hurting LUV stock.," Due to the unprecedented novel coronavirus pandemic and resultant governmental response, all industries suffered. However, few sectors absorbed the kind of damage that the air travel industry did. Even fiscally stable entities like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) were not safe from the fallout. Worse yet, what was once perceived to be a break in Covid-19 infections has turned into a nightmare, leaving LUV stock hanging in no-man‚Äôs-land.  If that wasn‚Äôt enough pressure, consider that Southwest is scheduled to release its second quarter of 2020 earnings report on Thursday, July 23, before the opening bell. On paper, covering analysts expect the company to deliver an earnings per share loss of $2.66. Individual estimates range from a loss of $3.75 to a loss of $1.30 per share. In the year-ago quarter ‚Äî and without the specter of a debilitating pandemic ‚Äî Southwest delivered an EPS of $1.37 against a target of $1.34. However, the disappointment isn‚Äôt unexpected. For the period covering Q2, U.S. air passenger volume averaged only 11% from 2019 levels. Thus, you shouldn‚Äôt expect LUV stock to move much based on EPS alone. The same goes for the revenue front. Analysts expect Southwest to ring up $930.3 million. Estimates were all over the map, ranging from $429.6 million to $1.8 billion. For context, the company generated $5.9 billion in Q2 2019. Therefore, whatever number is produced, it will look comparatively ugly. So no, don‚Äôt expect any ‚Äúpaper‚Äù fireworks from LUV stock. Instead, Wall Street is seeking answers, notably solidifying expectations for the rest of the year. If management produces a credible story, shares might swing higher as a reactionary move. But the more I dive into the details for airliners, the less optimistic I become. On June 4, most if not all airline stocks jumped substantially higher. On that day, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) announced that they intended to add back more domestic and international flights. Based on its analysis at the time, management felt confident in consumer trends. According to Vasu Raja, American‚Äôs senior vice president of network strategy, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a slow but steady rise in domestic demand ‚Ä¶ After a careful review of data, we‚Äôve built a July schedule to match.‚Äù Over the next few weeks, other airliners made similar encouraging statements, including Southwest in its ‚ÄúWOW Fall Fare‚Äù sale.

10,DAL Stock: Delta Air Lines Is on the Path to Profitability | InvestorPlace,"Delta Air Lines Is on the Path to Profitability. Management has a plan for Delta to become a smaller, more"," Chalk another headline up to this weird year. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) announced it lost a whopping $5.7 billion in the second quarter, and the market celebrated by sending DAL stock higher.  Crazy headlines like that can only happen during the year of the novel coronavirus. These are unprecedented times, particularly for airline stocks. The Covid-19 pandemic decimated air travel as billions of people heeded ‚Äî at least for a time ‚Äî stay-at-home orders and social distancing in an effort to reduce infection rates. For example, in mid-April, the Transportation Security Administration saw only 87,534 travelers go through its checkpoints. That‚Äôs just 4% of the traffic TSA had a year before. The traffic is coming back, ever so slowly. TSA reports that at the beginning of the July 4 holiday weekend, nearly 765,000 people flew. That‚Äôs 36% of the traffic seen a year ago. Delta and its peers are losing billions to be sure, and that‚Äôs not going to change in Q3. But there is renewed optimism that Delta has enough cash socked away to help it survive until a Covid-19 vaccine is released. Delta reported its second-quarter earnings last Tuesday. Revenue came in at $1.46 billion, with adjusted losses per share at $4.43. Analysts expected revenue of $1.4 billion and a loss of $4.12 per share. A year ago, the company‚Äôs revenue was $12.54 billion. The company said it lost $5.72 billion on the quarter ‚Äî its biggest quarterly loss since 2008. A year ago, Delta reported a second-quarter profit of $1.44 billion. Citing the continuing effects of Covid-19, Delta announced it is scrapping plans to add another 1,000 daily flights in August. It will instead add only 500. The Atlanta-based airline is unfortunately in the epicenter of the second wave of coronavirus infections. Why? Many of the nearby states either reopened too early or failed to heed the advice of medical experts in the spring. ‚ÄúDemand has stalled as the virus has grown, particularly down here in the South, across the Sun Belt, coupled with the quarantine measures that are going in place in many of the Northern states,‚Äù CEO Ed Bastian said on CNBC. ‚ÄúThose two factors are causing consumers to pause.‚Äù Delta isn‚Äôt providing guidance for the third quarter or the full year, citing uncertainty related to the pandemic.

A few select,"      Victoria Hetherington | July 20, 2020 | More on: AC Last week was a good one overall for the TSX. While financials and energy still trended lower, industrials and materials responded favourably to fresh vaccine hopes. The pattern was reassuringly familiar. Especially encouraging was the potential breakthrough made by biophama outfit Moderna. The response of the markets gave a glimpse of what a full-blooded recovery might look like, with beaten-up names seeing some gains. It‚Äôs been a turbulent time for Air Canada (TSX:AC). It hardly needs repeating how tough the pandemic has been for airlines. But Air Canada rallies have been supported by a contrarian bullishness that has typified the markets since the March selloff. The market crash created some historic value opportunities overnight. Airlines in particular have been generating a lot of contrarian interest. Then came Air Canada‚Äôs quiet segue into the cargo-only space. This saw the flag-carrying airline muscling in on Cargojet territory. But before a new buy thesis could emerge from this development, the news came out that Air Canada ‚Äì among other operators ‚Äì would be selling middle-aisle seats. The reaction was generally negative: Air Canada is still negative by 9% for the last four weeks. But last week saw a return of bullishness on the TSX. The Moderna breakthrough lifted Canada‚Äôs main market by more than 2%. At one point, Air Canada was enjoying five-day gains of 8%. It ended the week overall positive by 5%. Monday saw Air Canada remain flat. It might not have been much of a victory over all. But it was a taste of things to come. Investors should rest assured that a full, post-pandemic market recovery will include Air Canada. So, Air Canada is tied positively to vaccine rallies. But this also means that it will be tied to vaccine letdowns. Additionally, since growth is never going to be massive (expect a muted, staggered return to social normalcy) investors should not expect anything too amazing from Air Canada. A brief period of appreciation may be forthcoming, as the world gets a handle on the coronavirus. Air Canada upside is therefore likely to be somewhat limited as well as unspectacular. But then again, the pandemic has been making heroes of unlikely names. Bulls have been running stocks without a strong thesis other than momentum for momentum‚Äôs sake.

COVID-19 has,"      Stephanie Bedard-Chateauneuf, MBA | July 20, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock hit a record high at the start of this year but started plunging sharply when the pandemic put a halt to travel. The stock has been anchored for months, as investors continue to worry about the future of air travel in a profoundly changed world. Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu said in an interview with the Financial Post that the COVID-19 pandemic has been ‚Äúhundreds of times worse‚Äù for airlines than other events in history such as September 11, SARS, and the 2008-2009 financial crisis. There is an opportunity for a huge return with Air Canada if and when the airline industry recovers, but it is a high-risk bet. Air Canada stock jumped nearly 4% on June 29, as the company announced that flights for economy class customers were reaching capacity due to flexible re-booking options. The announcement came as Air Canada and WestJet said the week before that they would abandon the practice of keeping middle seats empty as part of an effort to maintain social distance on flights, as the pandemic of COVID-19 extends. The two companies appealed to recommendations from the United Nations Aviation Agency and the International Air Transport Association trade group, which said that the spread of COVID-19 could be adequately combated through other measures, such as surface cleaning, pre-boarding temperature checks, and mask requirements on flights. Air Canada is trying to get back on its feet after being shut down for months. With COVID-19 cases on the rise in the United States and other countries around the world, it‚Äôs very difficult to know when customers will want to fly back to a level close to the levels they were barely six months ago. The lack of clarity could be a buying opportunity for the airline if you‚Äôre willing to take the risk. If you believe that people will start traveling to a large extent within the next two or three years ‚Äî and they could well ‚Äî then Air Canada could be a buy at current levels. What could really help Air Canada and other airlines is a vaccine. Air Canada gained almost 14% on July 15 on positive news about a vaccine.

Early-stage human trial data on a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by this group will be published on July 20, The Lancet medical journal reported on Wednesday. This hint of good news was enough to drive stocks higher. And it was the riskier stocks that took flight. Literally.  Here was the price action for the major US airlines, for Wednesday July 15, 2020:  Even restaurant stocks got into the act. Restaurant Brands International, the owner of Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeyes, traded up some 3.8% on Wednesday. (Fun fact: That stock trades on the TSX as ticker QSR.

Airlines and cruise lines and restaurants are all‚Äîlet‚Äôs go ‚Äúinside and gather during a pandemic‚Äù stocks.  Investors (or perhaps make that traders) were rushing into restaurants just as many States in the U.S. were closing the doors of these same restaurants due to recent COVID-19 outbreaks.  And as an added complication to this theme, only 55% of Americans stated they would be willing to take a SARS‚ÄìCoV‚Äì2 vaccine. Even in Canada only 68% said they would take the vaccine. It will take the widespread trust of the public for any vaccine to be truly effective in stopping the virus in its tracks.

UAL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because United Airlines is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings ‚Äî with the most up-to-date information possible ‚Äî is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for UAL in this report.

In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of $7.18 per share for UAL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $9.13 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for UAL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +21.37% heading into earnings season.

Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).

Given that UAL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today‚Äôs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for United Airlines, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

In terms of client sentiment, 95% of IG client accounts with open positions in this market expect the price to rise, while the remaining 5% of clients envision a price decline. On 10 July, JP Morgan analyst Karen Li reiterated an ‚Äòunderweight‚Äô rating on the SIA stock, over concerns of the group‚Äôs associated Covid-19 capacity dilution impact, as well as potential challenges in ramping its return profile back up in the medium term. She thus maintained a ‚Äòcautious view on SIA‚Äôs near-term operational outlook‚Äô, noting that the airline group‚Äôs capacity cuts, coupled with its oil hedge position, ‚Äòcould lead to meaningful losses near-term, particularly given the current low oil price environment‚Äô. In addition, she gave SIA a share price target of S$4 per share, based on a target price-to-book multiple of 0.55x that she said is in line with trough-level valuations. Reversely, Li said that downside catalysts include a faster-than-expected recovery in travel demand/consumer confidence post-Covid-19 and a rapid recovery in oil prices in the near term.

They added that realised fuel hedging losses for the quarter could rise sharply to S$570 million, with oil prices falling below US$30 per barrel for most of April and May. Last Wednesday 15 July, SIA Group reported that its passenger carriage for the month of June 2020 across all its airlines declined 99.5% year-on-year.

Sign In Barstool Sports founder and mouthy trader Dave Portnoy got plenty of heat last month for calling Warren Buffett an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù after the Berkshire Hathaway boss unloaded his airline stocks and missed out on a big rebound in the beaten-down sector. According to Shane Parrish of the popular Farnam Street blog, that‚Äôs all part of the plan: ""You have to be willing to look like an idiot in the short term to get the best long-term results. I‚Äôd suggest that because the future has become increasingly uncertain, he‚Äôs preparing for the widest range of possible futures."" That‚Äôs how Parrish, hailed as ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äôs biggest influencer,‚Äù described Buffett‚Äôs current investment strategy in a recent interview with Business Insider. ‚ÄúWhen you don‚Äôt understand with a certain degree of certainty, you sit out until you do,‚Äù Parrish added, addressing criticism that Buffett has raised cash when he should be taking a more active role in profiting from the chaos. Parrish, who has hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers and has interviewed some of the biggest names on Wall Street, has been obsessed with Buffett for years. His blog is named after the street address of Berkshire‚Äôs corporate headquarters. ‚ÄúBuffett has taught me to be conscious about happiness, be conscious about being optimistic about the future based on the past, and just constantly having a smile and having fun with life,‚Äù Parrish once wrote in a post about Buffett‚Äôs impact on his life beyond just investing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about being purely rational about every minute of your day and optimising your time. It‚Äôs about living life.‚Äù And with that, Parrish said he‚Äôs confident in the direction Berkshire is headed.
