hile the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies. Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits. Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now. One company to watch right now is United Airlines (UAL). UAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 7.46, which compares to its industry's average of 9.32. UAL's Forward P/E has been as high as 9.80 and as low as 6.70, with a median of 7.49, all within the past year. UAL is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.37. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. UAL's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.66. Over the last 12 months, UAL's PEG has been as high as 0.45 and as low as 0.30, with a median of 0.36. Another notable valuation metric for UAL is its P/B ratio of 2.09. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.33. Within the past 52 weeks, UAL's P/B has been as high as 2.78 and as low as 1.86, with a median of 2.26. Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. UAL has a P/S ratio of 0.55.","Nov 13, 2019",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-value-investors-buy-united-airlines-ual-stock-2019-11-13

Why 266 Million Americans will buy this device by the end of the year. Get the Details! Sponsored The shares of United Continental Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) are trading at $92.71 this morning, after UBS initiated coverage on the airliner with a ""buy"" rating and $110 price target. The analyst in coverage glowed about the company's cost management profile in comparison to sector peers.  UAL is now trading within a chip-shot of its Dec. 3 record high of $97.85. It's been a turbulent 2019 for the airline stock, with the $81 level emerging as a solid floor in the last three months. Since its last test of that region in early October, the security has tacked on 14%.  Recent options traders have made calls quite popular lately. Specifically, the 10-day call/put volume ratio at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) stands at 1.89 and ranks in the 86th annual percentile. In the wake of UAL's earnings report last month, implied volatility levels have imploded, making near-term options attractively priced at the moment. The stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 22% sits in just the 7th percentile of its annual range, meaning now is an opportune time to speculate on the equity's short-term trajectory with options. What's more, UAL had been an attractive target for premium buyers over the last 12 months. This was per its elevated Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) reading of 88 (out of 100).

2,"Buy JetBlue Stock, United, but Avoid American, Says UBS | Barron's","Buy JetBlue and United, but Avoid American as the MAX Jet Returns, Says UBS. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. This Week's Magazine. Capacity","  This weekly email offers a full list of stories and other features in this week's magazine. Saturday mornings ET.  Tough times
are ahead for U.S. airlines
in 2020, according to UBS analyst Myles Walton, who launched coverage of the sector on Wednesday.   His pessimistic view is partly driven by anticipated above-average growth in capacity. The Boeing (ticker: BA) 737 MAX, for instance, is expected to return to service
in the first quarter of next year. With pressure on fares from more available seats, Walton recommends investors stick with airlines he believes offer the highest potential growth in earnings and cash flow over the next few years.  In particular, he rates shares of JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airline Holdings (UAL) at Buy. On the other hand, Walton says investors should avoid American Airlines (AAL). He is Neutral on Delta Air Lines (DAL). Both his picks offer the strongest combination of earnings and cash flow growth through 2021, based on his estimates. He expects American’s cash flow to improve too, but also believes per-share earnings will remain stuck. His target prices for JetBlue and United are $25 and $110, implying respective gains of about 28% and 17%. Walton believes American shares are worth $27, about 13% lower than recent levels. “With the return to service of previously parked aircraft and the concentrated delivery to US carriers by Boeing,” writes Walton “we’d expect pricing pressure to peak during [mid-2020].” Boeing has made about 300 MAX jets and parked them, without handing them over to customers. When the plane is allowed to fly again, all that capacity will hit the industry relatively quickly. Overall, he sees 2020 capacity growing at 5%, well above historical averages. The return of the MAX jet is obviously a challenge for the industry, but it’s a bigger risk for American, says Walton. American has 24 MAX jets parked and more on the way. Of course, the MAX’s return to service will also help lower American’s operating costs—it’s a more efficient plane—and allow it to win back some lost market share, given up because the airline didn’t have seats available. The case for buying JetBlue shares is more straightforward. Walton’s financial models indicate that earnings will be higher than Wall Street expects. He believes the stock will rise when other analysts catch up. For United, Walton expects an improvement in margins

3,LUV Stock: 3 Reasons Why Southwest Airlines Stock Can Climb Above $60 Soon | InvestorPlace,3 Reasons Why Southwest Airlines Stock Can Climb Above $60 Soon. LUV stock is up 16% over the past 3," Three months ago, in the height of the summer travel season, I wrote on that stabilizing oil prices, firming global air travel demand, and renewed optimism about Boeing 737 MAX planes returning to service in 2020, would propel Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock to $60 in no time.   At the time, LUV stock was trading hands around $48. Three months later, LUV stock has rallied an impressive 16% to year-high levels just shy of $60. The SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (NYSEArca:XTN), by comparison, is up 9.4% in that same time. Why? Oil prices have been stuck in neutral, so the outlook for Southwest’s margins has improved. At the same time, the upstart (still) airline reported strong third quarter numbers which supported the idea that global air travel demand remains vigorous. It has also become increasingly clear that Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 planes will return to service in 2020, and this optimism about a 737 boost in 2020 has investors buying LUV stock ahead of that catalyst. Net net, the fundamentals have improved over the past few months. As they have, Southwest stock has rallied. The big question now is will the rally continue? I think so. The fundamentals supporting LUV stock project to keep improving for the next few quarters. At the same time, the valuation underlying Southwest stock implies that shares have more room to run. Ultimately, then, the red-hot rally in the air carrier’s shares, which has propelled them to near $60 over the past three months, will persist and push the stock above $60 soon. Back in mid-August, the bull thesis on LUV stock was surprisingly simple. Thanks to various headwinds (surging oil prices, sluggish demand, and 737 noise), LUV stock had plunged into dirt-cheap territory. But, surging oil prices were set to stabilize going forward. Sluggish demand was set to rebound with increasing global economic momentum. And the 737 noise was set to pass as those planes came back into service in 2020. As such, much like its headwinds, the dirt-cheap valuation in LUV stock wasn’t going to last. Today, the bull thesis remains simple. Oil prices are still set to remain stable over the next few years. Yes, demand will come back into the picture in a big way as easing U.S.-China trade tensions spark a rebound in global manufacturing activity.

MORE IN TRADING,"The S&P 500 is having its best year since 2013. But one widely used strategy will likely block investors from profiting from the market’s record strength going forward, according to Crossmark Global Investments’ Victoria Fernandez. The firm’s chief market strategist, who has $5 billion in assets under management, is advising investors to avoid picking S&P groups and go for individual names instead. “We’re very weary of doing a broad paint-brush stroke for sectors in general because we see that there are many names within each that are going to perform differently,” she said Monday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” Fernandez uses semiconductors Intel and Texas Instruments as examples. They both belong to the same group, but Intel had a far better earnings report for the third quarter. Intel is now up 13% over the past month while Texas Instruments is down 8%. It reported disappointing quarterly numbers late last month linked to the U.S.-China trade war. She cites retail as another example. “It’s a very different story for someone like a Walmart versus someone who is more of a mall-based retailer,” said Fernandez. “Some are driven more by online than others. So, that’s why we think looking at individual companies makes more sense because there are idiosyncratic factors.” Despite her warning about going all in to sectors, Fernandez is positive on the stock market as a whole. “We’re actually optimistic for the market going forward especially from now till the end of the year going into the beginning of 2020,” said Fernandez. Her S&P 500 target for this year is 3,100 and 3,300 for year-end 2020. In early trading Tuesday, the index reached an intraday record high of 3,101. The Dow was up slightly Tuesday. The benchmark on Monday hit a fresh record close of 27,691. “You’ve had the recession and the slowing growth issues. You’ve had a consumer that’s been strong. You have the Fed, and what they’re going to do. The trade issues. All of these things have been uncertainties,” Fernandez said. “I feel like they’re starting to pull back a little bit, maybe starting to trough on some of the global earnings numbers and global growth numbers.” Disclosure: Crossmark’s Victoria Fernandez has positions in the stocks mentioned during the segment.

5,United Airlines Stock: Is It Worth Buying Right Now?,United Airlines Stock: Is It Worth Buying Right Now?. Why the underperformance?. United Airlines growing despite challenges. What’s ahead for,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO United Airlines (UAL) was one of the top airline performers in 2018. However, the stock hasn’t kept up pace with the broader market this year. With the YTD (year-to-date) return of 11.7%, the stock has lagged behind major US indexes. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones indexes have risen 23.1% and 18.7%, respectively, YTD. United Airlines stock has also lagged behind the iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT), which has risen 20% this year. Notably, IYT has allocated about 20% of its funds in the passenger airline industry. United Airlines stock is the third-highest gainer this year among major US carriers. Southwest Airlines (LUV) stock has the highest YTD return of 25.3% followed by Delta Air Lines’ (DAL) return of 14.6%. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) has lost 33% of its market value. American Airlines (AAL) is another big US carrier that saw a fall of 4.7% in its share price this year. We think that the underperformance of United Airlines stock is mainly due to investors’ concerns about its premium valuation. Last year, the stock was one of the outperformers in the airliner industry with YTD gains of 24.2%. As a result, the company’s valuation was way higher than its top peers. A variety of macroeconomic factors, including the government shutdown, global slowdown concerns, and trade war worries, also kept the stock highly volatile YTD–mostly in the negative territory. Investors became increasingly cautious of United Airlines stock following the worldwide grounding of Boeing’s (BA) 737 MAX planes. Notably, global regulators imposed a flying ban on the 737 MAX in mid-March following two deadly accidents within five months. The MAX grounding has caused thousands of flight cancelations and seating capacity losses every month. United Airlines, which owns 14 MAX planes, has reportedly suffered over 7,000 flight cancelations so far. Southwest and American, which together operate 58 MAX aircraft, have faced over 50,000 flight cancelations and millions of seating capacity losses. United Airlines has shown its ability to grow despite the negative impact of Boeing’s grounded MAX planes. The airline has improved its seating capacity and financial results despite the MAX grounding. Last quarter, United Airlines’ overall seat capacity grew 1.9%—in contrast to other players facing the MAX issue. Southwest recorded a YoY decline of 2.9%, while American’s seating capacity rose 0.1%. Moreover, United Airlines’ pre-tax margins are increasing at a much higher pace than its rivals.

9,Is United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) A Risky Investment? - Simply Wall St News,Is United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) A Risky Investment?. Why Does Debt Bring Risk?. How Much Debt Does United Airlines Holdings,"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk. It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings As you can see below, United Airlines Holdings had US$14.1b of debt, at September 2019, which is about the same the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. On the flip side, it has US$5.13b in cash leading to net debt of about US$9.02b. We can see from the most recent balance sheet that United Airlines Holdings had liabilities of US$15.7b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$25.2b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$5.13b in cash and US$1.62b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$34.2b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined. When you consider that this deficiency exceeds the company's huge US$23.5b market capitalization, you might well be inclined to review the balance sheet intently. In the scenario where the company had to clean up its balance sheet quickly, it seems likely shareholders would suffer extensive dilution. We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover","Nov 13, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-ual/united-airlines-holdings/news/is-united-airlines-holdings-nasdaqual-a-risky-investment-2
10,"Is Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) A Great Dividend Stock? - Simply Wall St News","Is Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) A Great Dividend Stock?. Payout ratios. Dividend Volatility. Dividend Growth Potential. Conclusion. Discounted cash","Today we'll take a closer look at Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) from a dividend investor's perspective. Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter. One way to look into the risks is to look at a snapshot of Delta Air Lines's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health. Investors might not know much about Delta Air Lines's dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last seven years and offers a 2.8% yield. A low yield is generally a turn-off, but if the prospects for earnings growth were strong, investors might be pleasantly surprised by the long-term results. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 5.8% of market capitalisation this year. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Delta Air Lines for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Delta Air Lines! Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Delta Air Lines paid out 20% of its profit as dividends. We'd say its dividends are thoroughly covered by earnings. We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Of the free cash flow it generated last year, Delta Air Lines paid out 28% as dividends, suggesting the dividend is affordable. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously. From the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Delta Air Lines has been paying a dividend for the past seven years. Its dividend has not fluctuated much that time, which we like, but we're","Nov 12, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-dal/delta-air-lines/news/is-delta-air-lines-inc-nysedal-a-great-dividend-stock

Boeing 737-300 overruns,"Posted on November 13th, 2019 by Russian Aviation Insider in Air Transport, Russia, Trending In a boost of confidence for the airline’s partners and its passenger customers, Russia’s biggest state-controlled bank has agreed to support the financially-stricken large Russian carrier Utair which, at the same time, posted more than one billion roubles (US$15.5 million) of net income in the first nine months of 2019. Sberbank, Russia’s largest financial institution, has confirmed that it has no intention to pull the plug on its Utair Airlines customer and has instead approved a new debt-restructuring plan. After the confirmatory statement from Herman Gref, Sbarbank’s chief executive, Utair’s stock went up by 14 per cent on the Moscow Stock Exchange. Sberbank is Utair’s largest creditor. “Regarding Utair, we have no intention of calling it bankrupt. Utair submitted a plan for its financial turnaround and we have approved it. Now we’re waiting for approvals from all [other] creditors,” Gref stated. In September, Utair approached its other creditors, a syndicate of different banks, with yet another proposed solution for its debt trap, which proffered the acquisition of more than 50 per cent of its entire debt for 39.1 billion roubles. The plan was for creditors to purchase the seven-year-term credit for 20 per cent of its nominal value, and the 12-year-term credit for six per cent – and it agreed to buy both of its credits for 4.5 billion roubles, or 11.5 per cent of their aggregated value. Apart from these debts, Utair owes an additional 17.4 billion roubles to Sberbank alone. Meanwhile, encouragingly, Utair posted a net income of more than one billion roubles in the first nine months of 2019, compared to the 1.9 billion roubles loss it suffered in the same period of last year, according to the airline’s latest report. Its revenues (by Russian accounting standards) improved by 3.2 per cent year-on-year in the period, reaching 46.8 billion roubles, an almost 1.5 billion improvement on the same months of 2018. This achievement comes as the result of a “continuous effort to improve operational efficiency.” However the airline nevertheless “shares a pessimistic outlook on the Russian air travel industry’s perspectives, due to low GDP growth rates and the effects of currency and fuel cost risks,” Utair’s general director Andrey Martirosov insisted. In the first nine months of 2019, the airline reduced its fuel spending by three per cent and, compared to last year,","Nov 13, 2019",http://www.rusaviainsider.com/russias-utair-navigates-around-bankruptcy-for-now/
13,United Airlines Social Media Crisis | by Rylee Thorson | Medium,"Sign in. United Airlines Social Media Crisis. Rylee Thorson. Nov 12, 2019·2 min read. . More from Rylee Thorson. More","United Airlines Social Media Crisis United Airlines received an overwhelming amount of criticism in April of 2017 following a video posted by a passenger on social media. The post contained a video which showed a passenger being violently dragged off of a United Airlines plane due to an overbooked flight. The video is quite disturbing as viewers witness the United Airlines passenger refusing to give up his seat, and then being forcibly dragged off the aircraft by security while people scream in terror in the background. As if the video was not enough bad publicity for the airline, United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz did nothing to help ease the tension following the crisis. He issued an extremely brief apology,https://hub.united.com/united-express-3411-statement-oscar-munoz-2355968629.html and tweeted to the public in response to the event. Below is a tweet released by Munoz the same day as the incident. Following the release of this tweet, Munoz made the mistake of release an internal letter to his employees which quickly went public that reaffirmed his support for employees while describing the passenger who was treated as a savage aboard the plane as “disruptive and belligerent.” This makes United Airlines seem tone-deaf and insensitive as a brand. As a result of what happened in April of 2017, United Airlines stocks took a huge hit (falling $250 million dollars). United also made several policy changes in attempt to “make up” for what happened on the flight that went viral, but still the brand’s reputation was severely tarnished. https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/10/travel/passenger-removed-united-flight-trnd/index.html In my opinion, United seemed rather insensitive when dealing with this crisis. Munoz issuing an internal message to employees stating that he disagreed with the public was a huge misstep, and serves as a poor representation of the brand. While the brand did take responsibility for the traumatic event, and issued apology statements right away, they never took noticeable action to demonstrate their true commitment to making sure a situation like this never happens again. While policy changes were implemented, they seems insincere. People want to see change happen, and in my opinion, United failed to show compassion and establish true change following this event.

Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader. Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock. Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there’s no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of the largest Macy's trades and the fact there were so many large trades make it likely that at least some of the trades were institutions hedging against large positions in Macy's stock. The large option trades in Macy's come after a new UBS survey found that 25% of U.S. apparel sales are now made online. UBS said that share is expected to grow to 31% by 2023.

is moving to match competitors by offering a new basic economy fare for passengers who are willing to give up early seat selection and the ability to change a flight. JetBlue said Tuesday it would begin rolling out “Blue Basic” fares on a couple of routes. The lower, no-frills tickets are expected to be available on more routes starting next year. Passengers who choose the cheaper tickets will board last, won't be able to pick a seat until 24 hours before the flight and aren't permitted to change a flight without forfeiting the cost of the ticket. Most JetBlue flight searches Tuesday didn’t yet turn up the Blue Basic fares, so it’s hard to compare the new prices. One route where a search did show Blue Basic fares was Fort Lauderdale to Nassau, Bahamas. A Blue Basic one-way fare to Nassau in mid-December showed up for $69, about $15 cheaper than JetBlue’s other less-restricted fares. The JetBlue Blue Basic fare for that one-way Fort Lauderdale to Nassau flight on a Tuesday was the cheapest found on a site searching multiple air fares, coming in about $3 less than a Bahamasair flight.

, which have also introduced reduced, no-frills fares. JetBlue and other airlines offering such low fares typically intend to make money by upselling customers who want to avoid the inconveniences of the cheaper flights, hoping fliers will choose to pay extra to check bags or choose a seat. JetBlue does expect the new fare category to bring in about $150 million in revenue next year, the airline said on the company's last earnings call. Blue Basic fare fliers still will have access to free Wi-Fi, snacks and drinks on flights. They can also bring one free carry-on, the same as customers who bought the more expensive fares. Most fare tiers charge for checked bags. ""Our new","Nov 13, 2019",https://www.benzinga.com/news/19/11/14800024/jetblue-rolls-out-blue-basic-a-cheaper-no-frills-fare
