Shortly after noon Eastern time, American Airlines’ stock was down 5.2% for the day and 9% since closing last Thursday.  United shares were down 4.5% for the day and 7.8% since Thursday’s close, and Delta was down 3.4% Monday and 5.8% since Thursday’s close.  Hawaiian, which no longer serves China but does have a substantial network in the Asia-Pacific region, was down 4.4% on Monday. The coronavirus, which appeared last month in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has thus far killed 82 people and authorities have confirmed 2,800 cases, according to CNN. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed five cases involving travelers who arrived in the U.S. from Wuhan -- two in California and one each in Arizona, Washington and Illinois.  The outbreak has led Chinese authorities to place 15 central China cities with a combined population of nearly 60 million people under partial or full lockdown. The Wuhan airport has also been closed.  The CDC is screening travelers from Wuhan at Chicago O’Hare, New York JFK, Atlanta, Los Angeles and San Francisco airports.  China Southern, with flights to San Francisco and JFK, is the only carrier that was providing nonstop service between Wuhan and the U.S. prior to the airport closure. The carrier codeshares with American. American and United are both offering refunds on booking to and from Wuhan. American, United and Delta have waived change fees on bookings to other Chinese destinations.  Historically, travel from Wuhan to the U.S. has been modest, according to the flight data analytics company OAG. During the first quarter of 2019, 13,267 people flew either nonstop or indirect from Wuhan to the U.S. At the time, San Francisco was the only nonstop destination.

4,Why Shares of Travel Stocks Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Shares of Travel Stocks Are Falling Today. Fears of a growing coronavirus outbreak from Wuhan, China, are causing a","   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) fell more than 8% on Monday morning, and shares of other travel companies, including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL), opened down more than 5%, following a weekend of scary headlines concerning the coronavirus outbreak. It is still far too early to know how dangerous this virus will ultimately prove to be, but investors have seen enough to move to the sidelines on key travel names. The coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, China, captured international attention and moved markets last week, and the news only grew more alarming over the weekend. The virus is now blamed for more than 80 deaths, and there are more than 2,700 confirmed cases on China's mainland, with more than 30,000 people under observation. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. As researchers learn more about the virus, fear is growing that it has a slow incubation period, meaning it is possible people infected with the virus can spread it before they have noticeable symptoms. The S&P 500 fell more than 1.3% at the open on Monday, in part because of concerns about the virus, and a number of travel stocks were hit particularly hard. American Airlines was the low flier among airline stocks because it is the U.S. carrier seen as most vulnerable to an unexpected drop in demand. American has the highest debt burden among major airlines. It is already facing labor unrest and is among the airlines most affected by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX. American Airlines shares are now down more than 13% in the last month, and other travel stocks are not far behind. Delta has actually held up better than some, but the airline is the target of concern because it owns a stake in China Eastern Airlines and has targeted that region for growth. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) also traded down more than 4%.  YEAR-TO-DATE TRAVEL STOCK DATA BY YCHARTS China also accounts for about 5% of global cruise capacity and tends to be the destination for some of the higher-margin trips for cruise operators such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean, with China accounting for nearly 9% of Royal Caribbean's total revenue over the past 12 months.

Steps to limit travel to China came after the death toll rose to 81, with more than 2,740 people infected by the virus. In Germany, Studiosus, a specialist online travel agent which sells holidays of up to 20 days to China for about 3,665 euros ($4,065) has cancelled trips until the middle of April, it said on its website. The move affected several hundred travellers, according to a spokeswoman for the company which last year had 2,300 customers travelling to China. The company’s next tour would have started on March 15. Customers with a reservation leaving before May 31 can rebook or cancel their visit, it said. Also in Germany, travel company DER Touristik will refund or change bookings for trips to China up to the end of March, it said in an email. At the moment, it has about 100 customers in China. The body representing France’s tour operators, SETO, has recommended members suspend tours to China until at least Feb. 21 and offer customers the option of changing their booking. Stocks in Asia and Europe fell sharply on Monday, with airlines and airport operators, hotel operators and luxury goods companies hit the hardest as investors worried about the impact of the virus on the global economy.

Past epidemics have had only a small impact on headline stock indexes,"," Are stock markets overreacting to the coronavirus threat? Possibly—but there is a real threat to companies in the travel sector. On Sunday, officials brought up to five the total number of people in the U.S. diagnosed with the infectious new virus that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has led to travel bans and lockdowns across China. European nations are also trying to contain the spread of the disease. Financial markets have taken a hit, threatening the momentum that has carried them since the start of the year. On Monday, European stocks fell around 2% in morning trading, led by airlines and China-oriented sectors such as resources and luxury. That followed the worst calendar week for global stocks since October. The broader panic may be short-lived. Historical evidence from cases like the outbreak of Ebola in 2014, the avian flu in 2009 or SARS in 2003 suggests there won’t be much long-term impact on the global economy or headline stock indexes. There are still reasons for caution at the macroeconomic level: China’s infrastructure is much better than it was during the SARS epidemic in 2003, which could enable a faster spread of the coronavirus. Also, the crisis comes at an awkward time for the Chinese economy, whose weakness has already hit manufacturers across the world.","Jan 27, 2020",https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-is-no-small-threat-to-travel-stocks-11580126981

15,How will the coronavirus hit Chinese stocks? | Morningstar,"How will the coronavirus hit Chinese stocks?. Morningstar analysts look at the sectors that will be affected by coronavirus, comparing","   The coronavirus that originated in China is spreading quickly, with cases confirmed throughout Asia as well as in the United States. Companies in the Chinese travel and tourism industries are the most likely to be affected by the coronavirus outbreak, Morningstar analysts predict; airlines and airports, casinos, resorts, and online travel agencies will be hardest hit. For example, casino operators in Macau, China’s answer to Las Vegas, are considering closing casinos if the situation deteriorates. To gauge the effect of this contagion on our coverage, we compare it to the 2003 outbreak of SARS, a similar coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people. Since SARS did not have a long-term effect on the financials of the companies we covered at the time, we believe this most recent outbreak is likely to lead to only short-term risk.  The current coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, though we can’t rule out the possibility of a mutation. Although the Chinese government has taken steps to combat the virus earlier this time than it did with SARS, mobility in China is greater than before, especially with high-speed railways and the continued growth in air travel. Looking back at the effect of SARS on the travel industry, we think this coronavirus could lead to a sharp, but short, shock to air travel demand, resulting in traffic declines for airlines and airports over the next few months. Airline stocks vulnerable Routes to and from Wuhan, where the virus originated, will be hit the hardest. Among the three largest carriers, China Southern Airlines (ZNH) is most exposed to the Wuhan civil aviation market, followed by China Eastern (CEA) and Air China (00753). On a company level, though, the Wuhan market is only a small portion of China Southern’s business, around 5% of the airline’s passenger-carrying capacity. However, given the public fear that the coronavirus has already spread to other regions in China and other countries, we expect to see a wider effect. With SARS, the number of airline tickets and hotel rooms sold through Chinese online travel agency Trip.com (TCOM) slumped in early 2003, while revenues and profits also crumbled. But all these metrics swiftly rebounded as demand for travel returned, helped by government subsidies to companies affected by SARS. Should the outbreak of this current coronavirus become as serious as SARS, we would expect operating profit to","Jan 28, 2020",https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/199068/how-will-the-coronavirus-hit-chinese-stocks.aspx

Investor fears grew on the potential economic fallout from the outbreak. The death toll in China has climbed to 81, according to Chinese officials. More than 100 people in 26 states are being monitored for the virus, a U.S. health official said Monday. The National Health Commission said more than 2,700 people are infected. More than 40 of those cases have been confirmed in a dozen other countries, including five in the U.S.  The latest developments sent stocks tumbling worldwide, hitting everything from airlines to resort operators. “The coronavirus is the number one threat to financial markets currently as global investors are becoming jittery on the uncertainty,” Nigel Green, chief executive and founder of financial consultancy deVere Group, said in a note.
