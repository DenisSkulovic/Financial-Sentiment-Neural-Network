BTC-USD.,"                                                   On May 2nd at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting (also known as Woodstock for Capitalists), in rather dramatic fashion, Warren Buffett announced publicly that Berkshire had unloaded its entire positions of airline stocks. It amounted to a roughly $4 billion fire sale of the leading domestic players – United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. As you know, Mr. Buffett isn’t known for making rash or snap decisions on his holdings. It’s been widely known that his favorite holding period is forever. In Buffett’s mind, this about-face boiled down to a belief that the world had quickly changed for airlines, which have essentially seen demand for air travel evaporate in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Betting against Warren Buffett on any investment has historically been a very poor decision – despite a rough five-year stretch, Berkshire Hathaway’s average annual return of 20.3% since 1965 has trounced the stock market’s 10% over that period. So why consider a bullish bet on the airlines? Global investment firm Deutsche Bank sees value in the airlines that Buffett recently shunned. Lead analyst Michael Linenberg noted, ""We are of the view that [airline] stocks have likely seen their low points based on where they traded following 9-11. As we have indicated in past reports, valuations have become untethered from any sort of reasonable framework, particularly since 2020 is shaping up to be a “lost” year for the industry. As such, we are now starting to focus on next year when we expect the industry to experience a significant recovery."" To this end, the 5-star analyst cites three stocks that are particularly well-positioned to weather the storm. We cross checked the vital analyst information for these names on TipRanks database to get the rest of the Street’s take. United Airlines Holdings Inc. (UAL) Chicago-based United Airlines is the hardest hit of the four largest domestic airlines. Its share price has plummeted from over $95 to a recent $25.42. That’s a more than 73% hit from its highs and has pushed its market cap down to $7.4 billion.

1,Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Today. As broader market optimism fades, so too do the airline stocks.. What happened. So","   Airline shares drifted lower on Monday along with the broader markets as investors appear to be having second thoughts about the speed with which the U.S. economy is reopening and the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Markets, and airline stocks, were in the green last week as states began to talk about how to reopen, but it is clear there will be no quick recovery. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) opened down 7.7%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) all opened down 5%. The shares recovered some of those losses by midday, but it looks like another volatile day for airline stocks. Airlines have been hit hard by the pandemic, with the U.S. industry losing billions in the first quarter and expecting even worse losses in the second. The industry has grounded planes and cut schedules, and airlines have added liquidity through equity sales, debt offerings, and government support, but they still face an uncertain future. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The airlines have enough liquidity to get through the summer, but at some point will need traffic to return to avoid a cash crunch. Until we have more clarity on when post-pandemic normalization will occur, and what the economy will look like when it does reopen, there are going to be doubts hanging over the shares. For now, it appears the major airline shares are moving up and down with broader market sentiment about the recovery. Abroad, the news is not much better. International Consolidated Airlines Group CEO Willie Walsh told United Kingdom regulators on Monday that he does not expect operations to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 or 2024 and said it could be 2026 for some. Walsh has a good view at the pan-European outlook, as his company is the parent of British Airways, Spain's Iberia, and Aer Lingus of Ireland, among other airlines. Although the U.S.-based airlines are more focused on when domestic markets will reopen, sustained weakness in transatlantic flying would cost American, Delta, and United the opportunity to generate more lucrative international business. The good news for airline investors is the seemingly daily 10% drops at the height of the crisis may be in the past, but it is going to be hard for the stocks to really gain momentum with so much uncertainty about where things go from here.

2,3 Airline Stocks That Can Power Through Market Turbulence | InvestorPlace,3 Airline Stocks That Can Power Through Market Turbulence. Traders who aren't afraid of risk can aim high with these," Source: Shutterstock It’s interesting how a sector of the economy can be stable for years before a black-swan event sends investors reeling. In the particular case of airline stocks, the spread of the novel coronavirus added a measure of volatility that hardly anyone saw coming. To make matters worse, legendary investor Warren Buffett famously dumped his shares of some very well-known names in the aviation industry. Three of those names are: Was the Oracle of Omaha right to give up on these airline stocks? Or is there still hope, and perhaps even serious profit potential, for these investments? Let’s take a closer look and see if these three aviation-sector names could be tomorrow’s high flyers. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  With air traffic down 90% or more on a year-over-year basis, it’s understandable that Buffett lost his resolve to hold onto DAL stock. On the other hand, there may be a lifeline coming in the form of a government bailout. As the company reports: “The agreement with [the] Treasury includes $5.4 billion from the payroll support program. The payment includes an unsecured 10-year low-interest loan of $1.6 billion, and Delta will provide the government with warrants to acquire about 1 percent of Delta stock at $24.39 per share over five years.” That’s a massive relief package and could be enough to sustain Delta for a while. Moreover, the company is enacting cost-cutting measures. These include “a companywide hiring freeze and offering voluntary leave options with 37,000 employees taking short-term unpaid leave.” Hopefully these proactive measures, along with the government’s bailout money, will enable Delta to get through this challenging time. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  Another investment worth considering, assuming you can handle the risks involved, is AAL stock. Like Delta, American Airlines should receive a much-needed boost from government funding. Because of the passage of the Cares Act, American Airlines can access $10.6 billion worth of funding from the U.S. Treasury. Even prior to that, the company was in a strongly cash-positive position with $6.8 billion worth of liquidity available at the end of 2020’s first quarter. And also like Delta, American Airlines is taking measures to cut costs. For instance, the company has retired around 80 of its planes, including some older ones. In fact, American Airlines even retired its fleet of 15 Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY)","May 11, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/05/3-airline-stocks-that-can-power-through-market-turbulence/
3,"Major Airlines Will Emerge From the Economic Tailspin in Good Shape, Analyst Says  | Barron's","Major Airlines Will Emerge From the Economic Tailspin in Good Shape, Analyst Says. “We think it is a case of","  It’s tough to see much upside in airline stocks. Avianca, one of the largest carriers in Latin America, just filed for bankruptcy protection. Travel in the U.S. remains down more than 90% from precrisis levels. And the economy seems to be in a tailspin, with unemployment surging to Depression-era levels. The hope now is that a recovery starts to take hold in 2021, fueled by a reopening of the economy and progress on containing the virus. That would imply there is some upside in the stocks, though investors may need to sit tight for a while until it materializes. “While the recovery remains hard to forecast, we think it is a case of ‘when’ not ‘if’ travel demand recovers,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon wrote in a note published Monday. “When it does, the airline industry will come into the next recovery with higher debt levels, but lower capital requirements, leaving a path for equity to appreciate.” Vernon cut his price targets and slashed earnings estimates on the big four U.S. carriers: Delta Air Lines (ticker: DAL), United Airlines Holdings (UAL), American Airlines Group (AAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV). He maintained Outperform ratings on Delta, United, and American, and held Southwest at Neutral. Delta has the most upside in his model, with potential to gain 77% from recent prices. The crux of Vernon’s argument is that airlines have most likely raised enough cash and liquidity to make it through the crisis, avoiding a scenario of operating under bankruptcy protection. While they have amassed more debt and diluted their equity (through issuing additional shares and granting warrants to the U.S. Treasury), their capital requirements and cost structures will be lower next year. That should set the stage for the equities to gain value as travel rebounds. The big unknown is the shape of the recovery. Vernon sees it happening in two stages. Phase one is from crisis levels—where we are now with demand down more than 90%—to a recession-era level. That could start to occur in late 2020 as demand picks up with a reopening of the economy and easing of travel restrictions between countries. Demand could bounce back to 40% of precrisis levels in that scenario—still bad but more sustainable than the current situation. The second phase he sees is from recession to recovery. Under that scenario, demand recovers to 50% to 60% of precrisis levels. When that happens","May 11, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/major-airlines-pandemic-economic-crisis-margins-debt-equity-travel-recovery-51589211954

Weirdest Economy Ever Here’s what US airlines are going through: The TSA has been reporting the number of daily checkpoint screenings. This is the number of people in the US who got on a plane for at least the first leg of a trip. A connecting flight would not trigger another screening. This is a rough indication of passenger air traffic. Between March 1 and May 9, 2019, the TSA checkpoint screenings ranged between 2 million and 2.6 million per day. This year between March 1 and May 9, they have collapsed to as low as 90,000 screenings, and though they have ticked up, they remain abysmally low:  Airlines reported that some flights have only a handful of passengers, some just one passenger. On these flights, crew members outnumber passengers. And this comes despite massive cuts in flight schedules. For example, United Airlines has cut its original schedule from the beginning of this year by 90%. During the worst days, screenings were down 96% from the same weekday last year. Friday was the best day so far, with 215,444 screenings, down “only” 91.7% from Friday a year ago. Saturday, screenings, at 169,580, were down 91.5% from the same Saturday last year. So a tad up from abysmally low levels, but still at abysmally low levels:  And this plunge in passenger volume has already had an impact on airline revenues in the first quarter, though the plunge in passenger traffic didn’t start until early March. Revenues for the top seven airlines in the US combined fell by 17.5% in Q1, largely due to the collapse of the last three weeks of the quarter: In the second quarter, the full brunt of the collapse in passenger traffic will be felt. TSA screenings so far in the second quarter, from April 1 through May 9, have plunged by 94.8%, from 91.1 million screenings last year to 4.8 million this year. The chart below shows operating revenues by all US airlines, including domestic and international flights, provided by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The BTS has not yet updated its data for Q1. So I estimated Q1 based on the actual year-over-year revenue decline at the top seven US airlines in Q1 of 17.5%, assuming that this would be the combined percentage decline","May 10, 2020",https://wolfstreet.com/2020/05/10/it-gets-rough-for-us-airlines-why-buffett-dumped-his-airline-stocks-thought-there-was-blood-on-the-tarmac-which-should-have-been-a-buy-signal/

7,Why Buffett Was Wrong to Dump Airlines | ETF Trends,Why Buffett Was Wrong to Dump Airlines. Recovery in Air Travel Is Well Underway. Incredible Buying Opportunity. . FREE DAILY,"By Frank Holmes, CEO and CIO for U.S. Global Investors Warren Buffett is arguably the most respected and accomplished investor in U.S. history. He turned Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company, into a multibillion-dollar holding company. Since 1987, Berkshire’s Class A shares have delivered an impressive compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 14.91 percent. That doesn’t mean all of his investing decisions should be seen as gospel. He famously doesn’t like gold, for one. And in 2018, he admitted that he was wrong to underestimate Amazon and Google early on. “I was too dumb” to recognize the opportunity, Buffett explained. He added that he and Charlie Munger, his longtime business partner, “miss a lot of things, and we’ll keep doing it.” I believe we can add another misstep to Buffett’s otherwise successful career. This past week, the “Oracle of Omaha” revealed that he recently dumped his entire stake in the big four U.S. airlines—Delta, American, United and Southwest. As of the end of December, the position collectively stood at around $10 billion. Buffett’s decision to exit airlines seems to have stemmed directly from the coronavirus lockdown and its impact on the travel industry. In other words, it had nothing to do with how the carriers were being managed. “We were not disappointed at all in the businesses that were being run and the management,” the billionaire investor told Berkshire shareholders on Saturday. “The world changed for airlines,” he added. While I agree with Buffett that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for airlines, I disagree with his decision to dump airline stocks for that reason. Few industries have escaped unscathed from the virus’ impact, after all. Berkshire is highly exposed to banks and insurance—banks are bracing for a wave of defaults and bad loans while COVID-19 could potentially bankrupt the insurance industry—and yet we haven’t seen Buffett cut Bank of America or Travelers from his portfolio. I wouldn’t be surprised if his divestiture was also prompted in part by a general concern of the virus itself. Last week I shared with you data showing that the average age of deaths in confirmed COVID-19 cases is 82. Buffett will be turning 90 in August, putting him in the riskiest age bracket. The truth is that few industries have been as resilient to external shocks as airlines. Between 2005 and 2008, about 70 percent of U.S. carriers were operating under Chapter","May 10, 2020",https://www.etftrends.com/innovative-etfs-channel/why-buffett-was-wrong-to-dump-airlines/
8,Buffett sold all his airline shares: should you sell too?,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Warren Buffett sold all,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Anna Sokolidou | Monday, 11th May, 2020 Warren Buffett, the legendary American investor, has decided to get rid of all of his airline stocks. This is presumably because he thinks it will take ages for the industry to return to profitability. The Oracle of Omaha chose to sell his entire stakes in United, American, Southwest and Delta Airlines. But I’m asking myself whether the future is really so grim for the airline industry as a whole? And how about top UK companies operating in this sector? In an interview Warren Buffett said” “I don’t know that three, four years from now people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year… You’ve got too many planes.” This is essentially about the long-term demand for flights, sales revenue and profit.  5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... There’s a good chance that the airline industry will recover after the end of the global economy’s lockdown. Restrictions will be removed and many people will, arguably, start traveling again both for work and leisure. But there’s a problem. In the UK, as like all over the world, the Covid-19 crisis is the sharpest recession on record. Many people have lost their jobs and some economists argue that the worst is not behind the world yet.  Many companies will not hire their workers back. As a result, the unemployment rate will remain high and many people won’t have enough cash to spend on holidays. So demand for holiday flight may not recover for a long time. And how about travel for work? Well, many enterprises are cutting their costs and will probably continue to do so for a while. These costs include paying for their employees’ business trips.  If all the arguments mentioned above turn out to be true, the demand for flights will stay limited for a long time. This will lead to the industry and its players shrinking in size.

Yelp — Yelp shares dropped 5.6% after an analyst at BMO Capital Markets downgraded them to market perform from outperform, noting there were “no silver linings” from the company’s disappointing quarterly results. AbbVie — AbbVie’s stock climbed 1.5% after Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of the biopharmaceutical company with an overweight rating. “We view Humira erosion fears as overly discounted and Abbvie’s prospects as underappreciated.

This year’s Rose Bowl, one of the two CFP semifinal matchups,","  BUSINESSAIRLINES By Kyle Arnold 6:00 AM on May 11, 2020 CDT American and Southwest airlines have taken on billions in new debt from private and government sources, burning through $30 million to $70 million a day in order to get through the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic when virtually no one is flying. Airlines had few choices, but what happens when the bills come due for all the new borrowing?   For Fort Worth-based American, its debt load totals around $40 billion. Dallas-based Southwest is in the best position of all the major airlines, taking out $7 billion in new debt since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Airlines are looking at significantly lower profits for years to come as a combination of health concerns and a deepening recession is predicted to keep many travelers off airplanes until 2022 and beyond. And carriers will have to use more of that profit to pay off loans taken due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One analyst said American won’t get through without significantly more help from the government or bankruptcy, an experience its leaders are all too familiar with. Another analyst downgraded the stock and put a $1 target price, showing little faith that it will have future value. American is responsible for the paychecks of 130,000 employees through at least September and Southwest has 60,000 workers nationwide. Both received government bailouts to keep workers on their payrolls until then.

The Straits Times Index (STI) opened at 2,597.85 and closed at 2,611.31, up 19.43 points or 0.75 per cent. Trade was relatively quiet, with 1.42 billion securities worth S$1.20 billion changing hands. Brokers said they were bombarded with queries from clients still confused over the intrinsic value of the mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) that Singapore Airlines (SIA) had also issued together with its rights issue. “There is still a lot of confusion after Friday’s wild swings,’’ said one broker.   Another said given the uncertainty facing airlines, most of his clients are waiting to sell their rights come Wednesday.  By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.

Priced at S$1 each, the bonds do not bear a coupon. If SIA does not redeem the 10-year MCBs before maturity, they may be converted into shares based on a conversion price of S$4.84. Last Wednesday, Societe Generale (SocGen), issuer of daily leverage certificates on SIA, announced that the theoretical ex-rights price of SIA shares based on the previous close would be adjusted to S$3.71, instead of S$4.16 as many had assumed. Jingyi Pan, IG’s market strategist, warned the next couple of weeks would be crucial in the assessment of the sustained Covid-19 impact. “As global economies continue in efforts to ramp up economic activities once again, two biggest near-term risks perhaps persist in the form of Covid-19 case resurgence and further US-China tensions,’’ she said.

15:15 After initial gains, European stock markets headed lower today amid fears over a second wave of coronavirus infections in some countries that have relaxed their lockdowns, such as South Korea, China, Germany and Lebanon. In London, airline and energy stocks have been worst hit, with easyJet the biggest faller, after the UK government announced a new measure to quarantine passengers arriving from abroad by air. Meanwhile, Halfords shares and sales have surged during the lockdown, with Boris Johnson urging people to walk or cycle instead of using public transport. Wall Street is also down. Oil prices have tumbled, with Brent crude now down 0.77% at $30.73 a barrel. Good-bye and thank you for all your comments. We’ll be back tomorrow. Updated at 3.21pm BST 11 May 2020
14:56 The Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane said there is a risk that the coronavirus pandemic will cause a long-term hit to spending by businesses struggling with higher debts, and households worried about their job security. He said on a Royal Economic Society webcast: All crises leave scars and this crisis assuredly will be no exception. Last week, the central bank said Britain’s economy could shrink by 14% this year, which would be the worst slump since the early 1700s, due to the government’s coronavirus shutdown, before bouncing back with 15% growth in 2021. The Bank warned that it could be even worse. On a brighter note, Haldane said he had seen signs of stabilisation in some spending measures recently, although they remained at very low levels. He added: Apparently Spotify downloads of the REM song “It’s the end of the world as we know it” peaked two weeks after the lockdown began and have been declining since. So perhaps, perhaps, we are seeing some stabilisation. 11 May 2020
