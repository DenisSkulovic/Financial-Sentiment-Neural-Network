0,The Dangers Southwest Airlines Stock Faces From the 737 MAX’s Return | Barron's,The Return of the 737 MAX Might Not Be All Good News for Southwest Airlines Stock. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. Review &,"  Every weekday evening we highlight the consequential market news of the day and explain what's likely to matter tomorrow.  The grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX jet has negatively affected more
than just the troubled aircraft manufacturer’s
business.   Airlines with the new model in their fleets have been forced to cancel flights and tighten capacity, missing out on potential sales and earnings
. They have been unable to fly 737 MAXes since March, when the plane was grounded by aviation authorities worldwide after two deadly crashes.  Along with concerns about slowing economic growth, the 737 MAX issue has held back airline stocks
in 2019. In the group, only Southwest Airlines (ticker: LUV) has matched the market: The stock has returned 24%, including dividends, this year through Wednesday’s close, equal to the S&P 500.  That compares with a 9.5% return for United Airlines Holdings (UAL), a 5% loss for American Airlines Group (AAL), and a 14% return for Delta Air Lines (DAL), which doesn’t have any 737 MAXes in its fleet. Recent signs have been pointing
to a return to the air in the first few months of 2020
for the Boeing (BA) jet. That’s help boost airline stocks in recent weeks, on expectations that the ungrounding will mean a lift in capacity growth in 2020 and lower operating costs per passenger thanks to the MAX’s greater number of seats than other models.   Investors have a particularly rosy view of Southwest, whose shares trade for 11.3 times next year’s earnings estimates. That’s a hefty premium to the other large U.S. airline stocks: American trades for 5.7 times, United for 7.1 times, and Delta for 7.8 times. But there’s another way to look at the coming return to service of the 737 MAX that paints a much less positive picture for airline fundamentals, and Southwest in particular. In a report on Thursday, Bernstein analyst David Vernon downgraded Southwest stock to Market Perform from Outperform. He sees expectations getting ahead of themselves for improvement in the company’s performance in 2020 and expects a slower and most costly return of Southwest’s 106 737 MAXes. “Changing out 14% of the active fleet with an aircraft that is kind of but not the same as your existing fleet is bound to come with unanticipated costs,” Vernon wrote. “This is a huge undertaking, and one that is ‘unprecedented’ at any airline at any time.

Let us bring the summary of the day’s most important news,"  Mumbai: Shares of grounded carrier Jet Airways India Ltd have surged inexplicably more than 50% in the last eight sessions even as the airline has not been operating for more than six months. The stock hit the 5% upper circuit for eight consecutive trading sessions, gaining 50.5% during the period. At 11.24 am, the stock traded at ₹22.60 on the BSE, up 5% from its previous close. So far this year the scrip has declined a massive 92%. On 17 April, Jet Airways suspended operations following an acute cash crunch. A consortium of 26 banks led by the State Bank of India has approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover dues of more than ₹8,500 crore. The airline has had negative net worth for long and has run up losses of more than ₹13,000 crore over the past few years. Its total liabilities amount to more than ₹15,000 crore. Lenders of Jet Airways have been trying to sell the beleaguered airline as a going concern for the past five months, with no success as yet. While the lenders saw initial interest from potential bidders such as Etihad Airways PJSC, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, none placed binding bids.

Jet Airways IANS  |  Mumbai 
Last Updated at November 1, 2019 22:37 IST It would seem beyond common investing logic, but the grounded Jet Airways is still flying on the bourses. Since October 18, Jet scrips on the BSE have gained over 44 per cent and closed on Friday at Rs 24.40 apiece. The stock, which could be out of most investors' portfolios by now, steadily gained nearly 45 per cent in just the past nine trading sessions, surprising analysts and investors alike. This is primarily owing to the October 18 announcement that the company shall be the first to undergo insolvency proceedings under the Cross Border Insolvency Protocol included under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), said Amit Gupta, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), TradingBells. ""This could speed up the bankruptcy proceedings, thereby increasing the chances of bringing some quick relief to its shareholders. Those believing that the market has undervalued the debt-ridden company would continue to buy, pushing up the stock prices,"" Gupta added. Gupta said that Jet Airways is a distressed stock, undergoing bankruptcy proceedings managed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Although non-operational, Jet is not yet unlisted from the stock exchange and there are people holding on to these shares as trading instruments. The share price had continuously fallen from Rs 265 levels in April 2019 to Rs 15.45 on October 18, 2019, post which it has been hitting the upper circuit on a regular basis. In a major breakthrough for India's insolvency mechanism, which is still in its evolving stage, Jet Airways would be the first Indian company to undergo insolvency proceedings under the Cross Border Insolvency Protocol. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had allowed the Dutch court administrator of Jet Airways to attend the meetings of the bankrupt airline's Committee of Creditors (CoC). The resolution professional and the Dutch administrator, however, filed an application seeking an amendment to the September 26 order providing approval to the Dutch administrator, which the appellate tribunal has accepted. The grounded Jet Airways owes over Rs 8,000 crore to its lenders.

Last Updated at October 31, 2019 00:58 IST STOCK PRICE - CLICK HERE FOR MORE BSE 1,650.859.55 (0.58%) NSE 1,651.058.50 (0.52%) Indian budget airline IndiGo headed for its biggest gain in more than three years after placing a blockbuster order with Airbus SE worth over $30 billion at sticker prices. Shares of IndiGo’s operator InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. surged more than 8% in Mumbai, in line for their best daily advance since early 2016. The stock is still below a record high of 1,898.85 rupees ($26.76) hit on Sept. 30, after slipping through October. IndiGo’s order for 300 jets from the A320neo family, including the XLR long-range variant, sets it up for a sustained expansion and could help consolidate its lead in India, the world’s fastest-growing major aviation market last year. Asia’s biggest budget carrier by market value has ordered more than 800 Airbus jets in the past 15 years as it embarks on an ambitious overseas expansion. “IndiGo may be trying to gain beneficial pricing in a difficult sales year,” said George Ferguson, a senior aerospace analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. That “obscures a poor year for aircraft sales, as airline profits slow in most markets except the U.S.”
IndiGo has specialized in bulk orders since it started operations in 2005, helping it win big discounts and lucrative maintenance deals with Airbus. The airline typically sells aircraft to lessors and then leases back, making a profit in the process and keeping a young fleet that consumes less fuel. The airline, founded by ex-US Airways Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Gangwal and former travel agent Rahul Bhatia, has quickly outpaced rivals in India. Yet the picture isn’t entirely rosy: IndiGo posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss last week and the two billionaire founders are engaged in a legal battle. The Indian aviation market has lured the likes of Singapore Airlines Ltd. and AirAsia Bhd. to set up local units. But provincial taxes make the subcontinent one of the most expensive places to buy jet fuel and intense competition has often driven fares below cost, making profits elusive","Oct 31, 2019",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/indigo-shares-gain-most-since-2016-on-30-bn-airbus-aircraft-order-119103100017_1.html

9,Southwest Stock: Why Bernstein Has a Different View,Southwest Stock: Why Bernstein Has a Different View. Why did Bernstein downgrade Southwest stock?. Peers suffer from the MAX grounding.,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Southwest Airlines (LUV) stock fell 1.6% on Thursday after a prominent Wall Street analyst downgraded the airline. Bernstein analyst David Vernon cut his rating on the stock to “market perform” from “outperform.” However, the analyst raised his target price on the stock to $61 from $58. His revised target price reflects an 8.7% return over the next year. Vernon’s rating downgrade on Southwest Airlines is surprising. Several other analysts upgraded the stock and raised its target price in recent months. On October 25, Wolfe Research set a target price of $62 on Southwest Airlines stock with a “buy” rating. Credit Suisse (CS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) also raised their target prices. Credit Suisse increased the target price by $5 to $60, while Morgan Stanley raised it to $63 from $60. In September, Southwest Airlines stock received rating upgrades from two prominent Wall Street analysts. Macquarie analyst Susan Donofrio upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “outperform.” She also raised the target price on the stock to $67 from $52. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Didora upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral.” He revised the target price to $65 from $58. Didora thinks that Southwest has a better cost structure than other US airlines including Spirit Airlines and American Airlines. He thinks that Southwest could expand its margins despite higher capacity and slower demand next year. Vernon thinks that investors are too optimistic about the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX’s return and Southwest’s performance in 2020. Notably, the Boeing 737 MAX has faced a global flying ban since mid-March following two deadly accidents within five months. The analyst warned that although the MAX’s return to the skies is good news, it could disrupt Southwest’s business on the cost or unit revenue front, according to Financial Insider. Currently, Southwest Airlines owns 34 Boeing 737 MAX planes. The company will likely receive another 70 MAX aircraft next year. Vernon stated that the return of 34 grounded MAX aircraft might put cost pressure on Southwest Airlines. The low-cost carrier would have to incur significant expenses to make the grounded planes ready to fly again. The delivery of 70 MAX planes next year would increase the company’s capacity drastically, which would put pressure on airfares. On October 1, Southwest Airlines raised its one-way domestic ticket fares by $5.

12,5 Top Stocks to Buy in November | The Motley Fool,5 Top Stocks to Buy in November. These five stocks have little in common --- except for having good potential,"   November is a great time to take a long, hard look at your investment portfolio. If you have stocks that have performed poorly and you no longer have confidence about their long-term prospects, selling them before the year is over potentially allows you to harvest the losses for a tax benefit. It also frees up cash to invest in other stocks with a greater potential for delivering great returns. We asked five Motley Fool contributors which top stocks they think are great picks for investors to buy in November. Here's why they chose Bookings Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF), MediPharm Labs (OTC:MEDIF), MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Dan Caplinger (Booking Holdings): Travel around the globe has expanded dramatically in recent decades, with a rising consumer class in many emerging markets adding new travelers to the market at a breakneck pace. Moreover, the success of airlines over the past decade has helped to spur greater capacity to allow people to go where they want more conveniently. Meanwhile, the rise of the internet has forever changed the way people do commerce, and allowing people to arrange for travel online has become a fast-growing business. Booking Holdings is at the intersection of the travel and e-commerce trends. As the leading online travel website, Booking has put together a strong combination of businesses under a single corporate roof. Starting with its Priceline ""name your own price"" travel website, Booking has made acquisitions like international hotel specialist Booking.com, online travel website aggregator tool KAYAK, and restaurant reservation service OpenTable. Booking.com was arguably the most important acquisition the company made, and that led it to change its name from Priceline Group to Booking Holdings in 2018. Growth at Booking has slowed recently, worrying some who follow the online travel giant. Much of the drop in revenue growth has come from the strong U.S. dollar, to which Booking is particularly susceptible because of its extensive international business and exposure to foreign currency movements. However, the company still has ambitious plans to expand. China has been a big target for Booking's growth, as it's made substantial investments in companies such as online travel platform Ctrip.com International, food delivery app provider Meituan Dianping, and ride-hailing specialist Didi Chuxing. China's economy has slowed recently, but its growth is still considerably faster than you'll find in many other parts of the world, and","Oct 31, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/31/5-top-stocks-to-buy-in-november.aspx
13,Canadian North - Wikipedia,Canadian North. Contents. History[edit]. Destinations[edit]. Charter operations[edit]. Fleet[edit]. Current fleet[edit]. Retired fleet[edit]. Corporate affairs[edit]. Programs and services[edit]. References[edit]. External links[edit].,"Canadian North is a wholly Inuit-owned airline headquartered in Kanata, Ontario,[5] Canada. It operates scheduled passenger services to communities in the Northwest Territories, Nunavik and Nunavut. Southern gateways include Edmonton, Montreal and Ottawa.[6] The company slogan is Fly the Arctic. The airline was established in 1989 as a subsidiary of Canadian Airlines, to focus on the transportation needs of northern Canadian communities. In September 1998, Canadian North was purchased by Norterra, a wholly Northern aboriginal-owned holding company,[7] and renamed Air Norterra, whose ownership was divided equally among the Inuvialuit Development Corporation, representing the Inuvialuit people of the western Canadian Arctic, and Nunasi Corporation, representing the Inuit people of Nunavut. After utilizing three different livery schemes, the airline adopted its final pre-merger logo in 2003. Its logo displays three of the distinctive symbols of the North: the polar bear, the midnight sun and the Northern Lights. Canadian North's slogan was changed from ""Your North. Your Airline"" to ""seriously northern"" (all in lower-case), with advertising changed to reflect different aspects of the company (serious service, serious delivery, etc.).[8] In June 2007, Canadian North began serving the Kitikmeot communities of Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak, Kugaaruk, and Kugluktuk.[9] In April 2008, flights began to seven communities in the Qikiqtaaluk Region (Baffin Region) of Nunavut.[10] On April 1, 2014, the Inuvialuit Development Corporation (IDC) representing the Inuvialuit of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region bought the 50% share of NorTerra held by Nunasi. This purchase of NorTerra gave the IDC complete control of Canadian North, Northern Transportation Company and other companies that were jointly held.[11][12] On April 11, 2014, Norterra and the Makivik Corporation, owners of First Air announced that they were in negotiations to merge the two airlines.[13][14] According to a website set up the same day the new airline would be owned equally between the two companies and ""a merger would create a stronger, more sustainable business, provide better service to customers and lead to new economic development opportunities across the North. We believe the two companies would complement each other's strengths.""[15] In October 2014, it was announced the merger would not go through,[16] but Canadian North would still codeshare on some flights with First Air until 16 May 2017.[17] On February 23, 2017, the Inuvialuit Development Corporation (IDC) announced that arrangements had been concluded to transfer ownership of Canadian North directly into Inuvialuit Development Corporation.[18] On September 28, 2018, Makivik Corporation and the Inuvialuit Corporate","Nov 1, 2019",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_North

Ryan,"      Motley Fool Staff | November 1, 2019 | More on: ATD.B BAD BMO CJR.B CRON ENB FTS MRU NA NWH.UN PDL PPL SRU.UN TOY WCN Overshadowed by the Big Five banks, National Bank Of Canada (TSX:NA) doesn’t get the respect it deserves. With a $22.58 billion market cap and total assets of $276 billion as of July 31, 2019, it is reasonable to think that National Bank could catch up to fifth-place CIBC one day. National Bank is the leading bank in Quebec, and has been around for 160 years. It has a dividend streak that has lasted for 39 years and is sitting at a current dividend yield of 4.04%. National Bank has exciting international growth prospects in the works. The company owns 100% of ABA Bank, which is Cambodia’s largest financial institution. With a GDP growth rate of 7.5% in 2018, Cambodia is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. The company also has a presence in Africa, U.S, and Europe. Fool contributor Christopher Liew has no position in any stock mentioned. My top stock for November is Cronos Group Inc (TSX:CRON). If you’ve been waiting to get into the cannabis industry, now might be your chance. Pot stocks can be volatile, but most analysts agree that the market could surpass $100 billion in sales by 2030. Down nearly 70% since its March highs, Cronos stock is priced at 2017 levels despite securing a lucrative partnership with tobacco giant Altria Group Inc. With Altria by its side, Cronos now has the resources and influence to be a long-term cannabis leader. Fool contributor Ryan Vanzo has no position in Cronos Group Inc My top stock this month is one that makes up for its rich valuation with its defensive attributes.  In fact, this company’s biggest strength is its steady and predictable (defensive) business that will thrive no matter the economic environment.  I think this is a real strength, especially now with an economic cycle that appears to be on its last legs. Waste Connections Inc. (TSX:WCN) is the third largest solid waste company in North America.  There will always be waste and we will always need a way to get rid of this waste, and this company has risen to the occasion.

17,Would it be smart to buy stock in the Virgin Galactic (SPCE)? - Quora,,"I’ll tell you two things honestly; Virgin Galactic has been so glacially slow getting the issues worked out of their sub-orbital joy ride that most people have forgotten the excitement of the first SpaceShipOne flights. If they remember anything about Virgin Galactic, they remember the terrible accident of the SpaceShipTwo breakup and crash. After that accident, their improvement program slowed to a crawl. They definitely had issues to work out, but it took them a long time.

 won't have to make any major fleet decisions for at least six years after completing a $30 billion, multiyear modernization program, positioning American to significantly increase free cash flow and returns to shareholders, according to company executives. Since 2013, the Dallas-based airline has replaced nearly 500 aircraft and now has about 934 mainline planes. The renewal program transformed its aging fleet into the youngest of the global U.S. network carriers. Two months ago American, the third-largest U.S. carrier in terms of passengers boarded, retired the last 26 McDonnell Douglas MD-80s, its domestic workhorse for about 30 years. By 2021, it will have phased out its 15 remaining Boeing 767-300 widebody planes and will have 24 Boeing 757 narrowbodies, down from 34 today. Last year, American ordered 47 additional Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 long-range jets to replace the 767s and other older widebody aircraft. And in June, it ordered 50 extra-long-range Airbus A321XLR planes that the manufacturer says will burn 30% less fuel than previous generation planes. Deliveries begin in 2023.  ★★★★★
