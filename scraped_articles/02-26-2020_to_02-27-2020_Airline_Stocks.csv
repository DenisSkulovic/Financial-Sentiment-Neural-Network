0,Coronavirus Is Punishing Airline Stocks. It Might Be an Opportunity to Buy. | Barron's,Coronavirus Is Punishing Airline Stocks. It Might Be an Opportunity to Buy.. . . Airlines stocks are bearing the brunt,"    Airline stocks are bearing the brunt of the markets’ coronavirus fears. That makes sense, to some extent. Global health fears and events such as the 9/11 attacks have, in the past, sent airline traffic plunging, and people on planes, after all, is the lifeblood of the industry. Travel always bounced back, but not before airlines started to buckle under the weight of their debt loads. But investors might be using an old playbook to trade the sector. The stocks are trading at distressed levels, but the sector isn’t losing money, yet. That is something for investors to consider as they weigh how bad the coronavirus will hit consumers’ travel plans. And while others are keeping their distance from the industry, this could be a time to buy for when things do eventually turn around. After all, today the sector is more consolidated and profitable. And debt compared with earnings for the sector is in line with other industrial companies. But the price-to-earnings ratios that investors pay for the stocks don’t reflect the improvement. The sector trades for 6.4 times estimated 2020 earnings, a huge discount to the S&P 500 multiple. Many backward-looking financial metrics, such airline load factor and profit margins, look good, but the problem is what happens next to traffic—and right now, traffic is declining, rapidly. Travel declines are what pushed Buckingham Research analyst Daniel McKenzie to downgrade seven airline stocks Thursday. “Until we can get our arms around what demand and revenue will ultimately look like, we’re stepping to the sidelines,” wrote the analyst in his research report. Airline stocks are already down about 21% year to date, on average, far worse than the decline of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. McKenzie, however, slashed his price targets by about 50%, on average Thursday. He believes things could get worse before they get better. “The downgrades are data-backed,” McKenzie tells Barron’s. He points out that bookings from Asia to the U.S. have collapsed in recent weeks and believes that pattern could be repeated from Europe to the U.S. if reported coronavirus cases continue to grow across the Atlantic. The industry can lose money if the shock is severe enough. How bad does it have to get, traffic-wise, for airlines to lose money? It’s hard to say. McKenzie models profits for the sector in 2020, but there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding all","Feb 27, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-airline-stocks-51582828125
1,Miton: EasyJet has 'structural advantage' as airline stocks tumble,"EasyJet has ‘structural advantage’ as airline stocks tumble, fund manager says. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","British carrier easyJet has a “structural advantage” over its peers as airline stocks continue to be hammered by coronavirus fears, according to Miton Group Fund Manager Eric Moore. As the outbreak begins to ripple through Europe and threatens to become a global pandemic, European airline stocks have plunged. Germany’s largest airline, Lufthansa, on Wednesday announced a sweeping cost-saving program which will involve the suspension of recruitment and an offer of unpaid leave to employees. EasyJet shares are down by around 20% this week alone, but Moore, who holds the stock in the Miton Income fund, said it is “structurally more advantaged” than the likes of Lufthansa. He suggested easyJet has a “sustainable cost advantage” and was “taking market share” from the so-called “flag carrier” airlines. Speaking to CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” Wednesday, Moore suggested that while there would undoubtedly be a short-term hit to demand, the stock’s prospect would depend on whether the outbreak fundamentally alters consumer behavior. “EasyJet itself has very short visibility, maybe six weeks forward visibility, so it is definitely going to be difficult, but if you think we are just going to push things to the right and in the long run, consumer behavior won’t change, people will still want to go on their holidays, people are going to take business trips, then it is a buying opportunity,” Moore said. While the U.K. has mostly contained its instances of the virus so far, Moore projected that the situation will get worse, given this week’s rate of new cases across Europe, and that airline stocks will likely be even cheaper in a few weeks’ time. EasyJet shares were down another 1.9% on Wednesday during afternoon trade. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

World's best airline stock now worst as virus stymies travel.,"  MORE  Latest Videos  Most Popular Content Feb 26, 2020  Divya Balji, Bloomberg News   Air Canada lost US$3.9 billion in market capitalization from its January peak, making it the worst-performing airline on the Bloomberg World Airlines Index this year. Its shares have slumped 28 per cent on deepening fears that the spread of the coronavirus will hinder travel. On Tuesday, the carrier extended the cancellation of all flights between Canada and China to April 10 over concerns about the virus known as Coved-19. It also stopped daily non-stop flights between Toronto and Hong Kong until April 30 due to reduced market demand. New clusters of cases have emerged in Italy, Iran and South Korea. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans should prepare for significant disruptions to daily life if the coronavirus begins to spread locally in the U.S. Donald Trump’s administration was also considering whether to adopt more restrictions on air travel because of the outbreak, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said. United Airlines Holdings Inc. -- the biggest U.S. airline to China before American carriers temporarily suspended flights -- withdrew its 2020 profit forecast late Monday, citing uncertainty from the virus. Last year, Air Canada won the global equity crown among airlines after rising 87 per cent with plans accelerate its global presence in leisure travel with the acquisition of tour operator Transat AT. Revenue from outside Canada grew to 64 per cent of total sales last year from 59 per cent in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About one-fifth of the airline’s capacity is on Pacific routes. In its fourth quarter results last week, Air Canada reported earnings per share that missed the lowest analyst estimate.

4,Airline Stocks Plummet Amid Coronavirus Fears | One Mile at a Time,Airline Stocks Plummet Amid Coronavirus Fears. Airline stocks down amid coronavirus fears. American stock hits post-bankruptcy low. FREE EMAIL NEWSLETTER.,"Travel in the Time of COVID: The news, resources, & information you need I enjoy dabbling in the stock market. I think the whole thing is kinda silly (I recognize that’s an oversimplification), but it’s easy enough to observe some macro trends and buy and sell based on that (if only Elon Musk’s insanity were easier to predict). Everyone needs a hobby, and for me it’s more fun than going to the casino and playing blackjack. This doesn’t really come as a surprise, but it’s pretty noteworthy the extent to which airline stocks are taking a beating amid coronavirus fears, with one airline in particular reaching the lowest post-Chapter 11 stock price. As of the time that I’m writing this post:  As noted by @xJonNYC, American has been the hardest hit, and their stock has fallen by about a third in the past couple of weeks. American’s stock is now at an all time low while trading under “AAL” — “AMR” (American’s old ticker symbol) was at this price in September 2013, when the company was still in bankruptcy protection, before the merger with US Airways. American’s big drop in stock price is in spite of the fact that American has less exposure in Asia than United, for example. To me this points to American probably being the most vulnerable in the US market in the event that coronavirus spreads here. Anyway, I’m certainly no expert on stocks (and I’m not suggesting anyone should buy or sell stocks, or trying to provide any sort of advice), so I’m purely sharing this because I’m always looking to buy when I think the price is right. Personally I still don’t think we’ve seen the worst (because I don’t think the US is safe from coronavirus). But for those who think the worst is behind us and who like to buy airline stocks, the massive recent drops in stock prices are worth being aware of… To those who invest in airline stocks — are you buying now, or do you think it’s getting worse?

5,Coronavirus - Lessons from SARS for investors - Investors' Corner,Coronavirus – Lessons from SARS for investors. HOW DID FINANCIAL MARKETS REACT THEN? HOW MIGHT THINGS EVOLVE THIS TIME?. HONG,"The official blog of BNP Paribas Asset Management There are inevitably more differences than similarities between the current coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic and the outbreak of SARS in 2003, but there are still lessons to be learned. To begin with, 17 years ago the US was building up to its invasion of Iraq and concern about the impending war was the primary market driver. Moreover, China now accounts for 17% of global GDP compared with 4% in 2003, 40% of global trade versus 5%, so its equity market is now several times larger, so the economic impact of the epidemic will be felt far more this time around the world compared to the regional impact SARS had previously. While SARS broke out in November 2002, it did not begin to affect markets until March 2003. Hong Kong equities started to underperform global equities noticeably after the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert about a new infectious disease in Vietnam and Hong Kong. Even though the crisis was declared over by summer, the factor that turned equity market performance around was the Hong Kong government’s announcement of a USD 1.5 billion relief package to boost the domestic economy. The local market subsequently outperformed global equities over the next several weeks. The equity indices which did the worst not surprisingly concerned those markets most tied to the travel and leisure industries, and to retail demand. Given that SARS hit the local market when global equities were rallying, US Treasury yields were rising and gold was falling, there was no obvious safe haven trade. The best performing of the Chinese domestic industries was pharmaceuticals: it gained 11% on anticipated demand for medication. Once the broader market rebound began, three out of the five worst-performing sectors moved to the top-5 of the best: airlines, diversified financial services, and software. The remaining top performers – metals & mining and chemicals – had not fallen by as much during the downturn. The current COVID-19 outbreak is taking place at a time when there are few other big factors for the markets: GDP growth is generally steady, central bank policy is broadly on hold, and the latest company earnings reports have provided few big surprises. Moreover, equity markets had already rallied sharply since early October and valuations had become stretched. Arguably, markets were just looking for a catalyst to correct. In contrast, early 2003 saw markets","Feb 27, 2020",https://investors-corner.bnpparibas-am.com/investing/coronavirus-lessons-from-sars-for-investors/

7,Norwegian Air punished as investors' worries over virus deepen | Reuters,Norwegian Air punished as investors' worries over virus deepen. . . . . . . . . . . .,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Terje Solsvik, Tommy Lund 3 MIN READ OSLO (Reuters) - Shares in Norwegian Air NWC.OL plunged a quarter in value on Thursday, leading airline stocks lower as investors bet the debt-laden budget carrier would be the most vulnerable to a coronavirus pandemic. The slump in Norwegian shares to an 11-year low of 16.80 crowns came despite the company trying to reassure investors by reiterating its financial guidance. The stock has now lost 52% since the start of this week as the coronavirus has spread around the world, threatening an extended period of disruption to international travel. “This (share price slide) is the worry that corona depletes demand and that (it) creates a cash flow crunch at Norwegian,” Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote in an emailed comment. He added, however, that Norwegian’s ongoing cost cuts and planned asset sales could see the company through. Norwegian, which has repeatedly had to raise cash from its owners to survive, said at its quarterly results on Feb. 13 that it expected to report a profit in 2020 after three consecutive years of losses. “As of today, the company maintains the guidance and outlook presented in relation to the Q4 reporting on 13 February ... The company is monitoring the market situation on a regular basis,” Norwegian said in a statement on Thursday. It said it had put out the statement in response to “market speculation” and subsequent inquiries from shareholders. A pioneer in low-fare transatlantic air travel, Norwegian’s rapid expansion has left it in the red and heavily in debt, forcing it to cut unprofitable routes and slash operating costs. Rattled by the coronavirus, airlines have rushed to cut costs in recent days. Still, shares in Scandinavian carrier SAS SAS.ST fell by 12.3% on Thursday, while Easyjet EZJ.L was down 11.0%, Ryanair RYA.I 5.7%, Lufthansa LHAG.DE 7.2%, Air France AIF.PA 10.6% and British Airways parent IAG ICAG.L fell 10.0%. Norwegian raised cash from its owners in late 2019 for the third time in less than two years, and issued convertible bonds at the same time to help shore up its finances. The bonds have so-called covenants linked to the finances of a key subsidiary, Arctic Aviation Assets (AAA), which must keep its book equity and debt levels within certain minimum levels.

MORE FROM,"There's at risk, and then there's really at risk. Even after this market has been clubbed for five days, we find situations where things could get appreciably worse, and things could only get worse. I think that's where the focus has to be -- loss mitigation -- because there are too many companies that could see earnings hammered and stay hammered, while others will see them hammered once or twice or maybe three times only until their stocks represent too many estimate cuts and that's when they will bottom. To call a bottom before then might be possible in some individual stories, but certainly not the averages. If you are investing in S&P funds, you should know that if you have cash you probably have to pick at something, just add a little to the market. If it really bounces hard, you can lighten up. But the idea of buying in stages, lower, has worked for all financial crises and biological crises, and this one will be no different except we are early in the epidemic here. We have put a sliver of money to work from my Charitable Trust, Action Alerts PLUS, but we haven't even dented the cash we raised on Monday's stronger opening and Tuesday's bounce. That's going to be put to work today if we find bargains. But let's deal with a typical individual stock of a company that's in the blast zone. Let's deal with Southwest Air (LUV) . I am picking on Southwest because it is the best of the best, with solid management from Gary Kelly and a long history -- unlike other airlines -- of profitability. This company's been profitable 45 years in a row. That's astounding in any industry, not just this once-hapless sector. Plus Southwest has long been Warren Buffet's favorite airline: He owns 10%. An amazing endorsement from the best there ever was. Let me first state my view that ever since this Covid-19 nightmare began, I have said we will not be immune and our markets are not set up for what could occur. You can call me bearish. You can call me disconcerted. But I think I have probably been the biggest bear about this disease when it comes to those on TV, and I have despised anything travel and leisure related.

10,Why Airline Shares Are Down Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Down Today. Wall Street analysts are beginning to assess the damage coronavirus has done to the,"   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) fell more than 9% on Thursday morning, and shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) each fell more than 6%, on continued coronavirus worries. Investors have been concerned for weeks that the virus would impact travel plans, and Wall Street analysts are beginning to try to get a sense of the damage done to the businesses. Airline stocks are a natural target for a coronavirus-related sell-off, with companies sure to see revenue declines in the first quarter due to cancelled flights. The more recent concern is that the spread of the virus into new regions would stunt global demand, and might weigh heavy on the minds of U.S. consumers as they book summer vacation travel. On Thursday a number of airline stocks were downgraded by Deutsche Bank and Buckingham due to coronavirus concerns. Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg said that there is an increasing risk the coronavirus will impact travel patterns in the U.S., affecting peak travel periods including spring break, Easter, and summer. It could also impact business travelers, which tends to be a more lucrative business for airlines. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Buckingham analyst Daniel McKenzie said his firm's booking survey found a ""near-collapse"" of demand to Asia, and worried recent warnings by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were likely to impact U.S. travel. McKenzie said he initially had expected airline stocks to fall 10% to 15% further, but the pullback could be stronger and for longer than he had assumed. American is under particular pressure because the company is seen as the most vulnerable major U.S. carrier to a prolonged slowdown in travel demand. American has the highest debt burden among U.S. airlines, and had intended to use 2020 profits to accelerate debt payments. Shares of American have now lost more than one-third of their value in the last two weeks. Delta, meanwhile, has substantial exposure to Asia and owns a stake in one of China's top airlines, while Southwest is closely tied to U.S. leisure travel and is likely to feel a pinch if spring break travel is curtailed. For the airlines, the question isn't whether the coronavirus will impact operations, it is how much they will impact and for how long.

11,Why Shares of Sabre Are Down Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Sabre Are Down Today. The travel software company confirms that the coronavirus is going to materially affect,"   Shares of Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) fell more than 15% on Wednesday after the travel software company said the coronavirus will have ""a material impact"" on its 2020 financial results, though it is not yet able to tell how big that impact will be. Sabre, a onetime subsidiary of American Airlines Group, still runs the back-end reservation systems for many airlines. With American and other airline stocks falling due to concerns the coronavirus outbreak will eat into travel demand, it is only logical that Sabre would feel the pinch as well. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Sabre on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter results in line with expectations but confirmed that the outlook for 2020 is uncertain due to the coronavirus. The company provided initial guidance for 2020 earnings of between $1.10 and $1.30 per share, with the midpoint below analysts' $1.24-per-share consensus, but said it has not yet incorporated the impact of the coronavirus into those results. Airlines in late January canceled flights into China due to the country's virus-related shutdown, and in recent days, as the outbreak has spread to new regions, there has been growing concern that anxiety about the virus could cause a depressed summer travel season. If so, the impact of the coronavirus would last into the second half of the year, bringing down results for airlines and for companies like Sabre that serve them. Even before the coronavirus outbreak, Sabre was having a hard time getting investors interested in its shares, with the stock basically flat over the five-year period leading up to Wednesday's earnings announcement and underperforming the S&P 500 by about 50 percentage points during that period. The company has a plan to spur growth, having acquired Radixx to expand its services to low-cost airlines. It has also announced plans to build a full-service property management system with hotel giant Accor. ""The travel ecosystem is continuing to shift as the needs of our airline, hotel and agency customers change,"" Sean Menke, CEO of Sabre and the former head of Frontier Airlines, said in a statement. ""We must continue to evolve retailing, distribution and fulfillment of travel to help our customers drive revenue growth and increase traveler loyalty."" That's all well and good, but it is going to take time to play out. Given the near-term uncertainty involving the coronavirus, investors on Wednesday aren't interested in waiting around to see what happens.

China's coronavirus is bringing pain to the transportation sector, but don't"," Source: Shutterstock The mood on Wall Street has soured, and for good reason. Investor sentiment is being tested hard. The coronavirus from China is spreading like wildfire around the globe, creating panic among world leaders. Consequently, countries are closing borders and businesses are shutting down. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) updated investors about the outbreak’s impact on PC sales yesterday. The airline stocks in particular were hit very hard. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), for example, is down 20% from recent highs. Most of that drop came in the last few days. It continues to cancel flights to and from impacted areas. It’s not suffering alone, as Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is also 15% below its January levels. Investors are right to be nervous, but sometimes they overreact. Today we will examine the opportunities in these two stocks. Perhaps they have been punished too harshly and maybe there are levels where they will find footing. In addition, we will also look at the Transportation sector via the iShares Transportation Average ETF (BATS:IYT) as an alternative to betting on single stocks. Before we delve into some details it is important to note that the goal today is not to call a bottom. My point here is to assess the upside potential and quantify the downside risk. Catching falling knives is a dangerous practice, especially when the tickers in question are in the direct line of the virus. Travel and leisure stocks will probably be last to recover, and they started suffering first. Supply chains may have some leeway, but travel will remain challenged until the solution comes.

Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg reduced his rating to hold from buy. “We are lowering our ratings to hold on most of our buy-rated U.S. airline stocks (AAL, ALK, DAL, JBLU, SAVE and UAL), as it is becoming increasingly more likely that the spread of Covid-19 will disrupt travel patterns beyond China,” he wrote in a report. “We are also concerned that the coronavirus crisis will start to negatively impact peak travel periods such as spring break, Easter travel and early summer, which we believe is already starting to manifest itself in lower booking trends,” the analyst added. Corporate travel restrictions also are a problem, Linenberg said.

The airline extended its halt of flights to Beijing and Hong Kong until May. Israel has banned foreigners who were recently in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Italy, and ordered Israelis returning from those countries to self-quarantine. The Health Ministry urged Israelis Wednesday to seriously consider refraining from traveling abroad, becoming the first country to issue such a statement. The Health Ministry said Thursday that an Israeli man who returned from Italy for the disease, the first case of an infection in the country outside of a hospital quarantine, raising fears he may have infected others.

Today. Terry","Coronavirus knocks markets Airline stocks among worst affected Financial markets around the world have endured a turbulent week amidst ongoing fear about the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, known as Covid-19. This followed a spike in the number of cases in Italy, and reports that Iran’s deputy health minister has tested positive for the virus. Airlines and travel companies were among the stocks worst affected, as we explore in our news pages this week. The oil price was also in decline. In an interview with CNBC, US National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow indicated that the stock market sell-off could represent a buying opportunity for longer-term investors.   Countrywide and LSL in merger talks Discussions ongoing Countrywide (CWD) and LSL Property Services (LSL) confirmed that they are in talks over an all-share merger at the start of the week. Shares in the former troubled estate agency services group – which had agreed the sale of its commercial business in November – were down 4 per cent in early trading on the release of this news. Discussions between the two parties are ongoing, and – at this stage – the groups said that there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made for Countrywide.   Urban house prices rise Up 3.9 per cent House prices in all cities in England have climbed above their 2007 peak for the first time since the financial crisis, according to the latest Zoopla UK Cities House Price Index. The annual rate at which property values are rising across all UK cities reached a 33-month high of 3.9 per cent in January 2020. Richard Donnell, head of research and insight at Zoopla, said: ""An imbalance between supply and demand is supporting the current rate of house price growth – a trend we expect to remain in place in the first half of 2020”.   GSK and Clover join forces on coronavirus Research partnership China-based clinical-stage biotech company Clover has entered into a research partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for its protein-based coronavirus vaccine candidate, ‘COVID-19 S-Trimer’. “We are proud to contribute to cutting-edge research from scientists at Clover Biopharmaceuticals in China as part of our strategy to make our adjuvant technology available to selected partners who have a promising vaccine candidate against the newly emerged coronavirus,” said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines.

17,Why Coronavirus Is Causing Airline Shares To Plummet In Value - Simple Flying,Why Coronavirus Is Causing Airline Shares To Plummet In Value. Airline stocks take a battering. Constant continuous shock syndrome. Problem," Amid fears that the coronavirus is spreading beyond China, share markets are in retreat this week and airline share prices are no exception. United Airlines opened on the Nasdaq on Monday morning at a touch over USD$78. They closed on Tuesday evening at USD$70.58. IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, opened on the LSE on Monday morning at 623.00p. They closed last night on 551.40p. American Airlines’ share price dropped 8.5% on Monday, closing at USD$25.45, a four-month low. The slide continued on Tuesday, closing at USD$23.12. It was a pattern repeated at stock exchanges around the world on Monday and Tuesday. Some stock exchanges have already opened for Wednesday trading and share prices continue to fall. Airlines, vulnerable as they are to external forces, are always amongst the first companies to feel the effects of wider economic downturns. You may need to keep buying food to eat but the vast majority of us do not need to keep flying. One airline boss said that, even before coronavirus, the wider aviation operating environment was constantly challenging. He said an airline needed to be structured so as to keep flying in the face of continuous challenges. He called it constant continuous shock syndrome, saying an airline needed to be very robust to survive. The Chinese carriers are the most heavily impacted, with more than 200,000 flights to, from and within China already canceled. But any airline operating services to and within Asia is adversely affected. The problem is set to get worse before it gets better. There are reports of coronavirus outbreaks in South Korea and Italy and talk of closing borders to citizens of more countries. There are no indications that the coronavirus outbreak has peaked. The problem for airlines is multi-faceted. As existing flights are canceled and/or suspended, airlines are foregoing revenue from future ticket sales and incurring expenses by issuing refunds on prior ticket sales. Further, there are signs of deep discounting to stimulate short term future travel. Last night, I was to able to buy a ticket from Australia to South East Asia for under USD$100. This is great for me, but the problem for the airline is foregone revenue. Before the coronavirus outbreak and slumping travel demand, that ticket would have sold for around USD$250. As the discounting looks set to spread, it represents rich pickings for bargain hunters and bad news for","Feb 26, 2020",https://simpleflying.com/why-coronavirus-is-causing-airline-shares-to-plummet-in-value/
