0,Why This Under-the-Radar Stock Is a Buy in Today’s Market | The Motley Fool,Why This Under-the-Radar Stock Is a Buy in Today’s Market. This company is poised to weather any storm.. Change in,"   In a bull market where dazzling IPOs and tech stocks tend to capture the spotlight, it can be easy to lose sight of steady performers like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). Southwest has a history of financial strength and a reputation for a rock-solid balance sheet. The company's fundamentals, consistent performance, and low P/E ratio that is about half of the S&P 500 make it a premier value stock in today's market. The past decade was nothing short of revolutionary in terms of investor sentiment toward airline stocks. All six major airline stocks ascended over 200% in the 2010s, beating the S&P 500 during one of the best bull markets in history. In years past, even top investors like Warren Buffett criticized the cyclical nature and capital intensity of airlines. That changed in 2016 when Berkshire Hathaway purchased shares of four major airlines. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Despite droves of airline bankruptcies in the early and mid-2000s, including United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, followed by American Airlines in 2011, Southwest has remained profitable for 46 consecutive years. But Southwest was truly tested in 2019 as arguably the biggest loser from the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX groundings. ""This is our 49th year and ... at least in my experience, there is no more remarkable year than 2019,"" said CEO Gary C. Kelly during the fourth-quarter conference call. ""The grounding of effectively 75 of our airplanes, which is about 10% of our fleet, presents a crisis-like challenge, and our people are ready for it with the best planning, tools and technologies in our history, but more importantly with the right fortitude and the right resolve to get through this crisis."" Southwest is an unfortunate recipient of the fallout from Boeing's groundings. As an exclusive operator of Boeing aircraft, Southwest has been forced to endure headache and heartache by canceling and redrawing flight schedules and downright improvising during peak travel seasons due to an undersized fleet. It is for this reason that Southwest Airlines is a true under-the-radar stock in today's bull market. It's easy for the company's record third quarter in 2019 to go unnoticed if all anyone is talking about are the MAX delays. It's undeniable that Southwest will face short-term headwinds from the MAX issues. That being said, lower fuel prices as a result of oil and gas oversupply and the coronavirus outbreak in China actually benefit Southwest's","Feb 21, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/21/why-this-under-the-radar-stock-is-a-buy-in-todays.aspx

3,The Coronavirus Shouldn’t Scare Airline Investors Away - U.S. Global ETFs,The Coronavirus Shouldn’t Scare Airline Investors Away. Be the first to know what’s new!. Get our latest research that relates,"As the coronavirus continues to spread globally and airlines cancel most flights in and out of China, investors are probably wondering – should airlines be avoided for the near future? Not necessarily. We view it as a buying opportunity. The economic repercussions of this global health emergency will no doubt have a big impact on airlines and tourism, but we expect the industry to return back to normal levels after the virus is contained. If investors are seeking a precedent to compare to the recent coronavirus, they need only look back 10 years, when the H1N1 Swine flu made it the U.S. via Mexico. An estimated half a million people died as a result of the virus, 12,000 in the U.S. alone. Major U.S. carriers were impacted, with Delta Air Lines reporting between $125 million and $150 million in lost revenue, according to a note from Credit Suisse. But the virus was relatively short-lived, and the industry promptly recovered. Before that, in 2003, was the SARS epidemic. Air traffic to China fell by nearly half year-over-year in the second quarter of that year, which may have had a negative impact on airline earnings. Credit Suisse points out it’s hard to estimate SARS’ impact on airlines since there was also the Iraq War, not to mention a weak macro environment at the time. Airlines, as measured by the NYSE Arca Global Airline Index, were quick to recover once the threat of SARS dissipated, and carriers were citing normalization of trends, including capacity growth, in the second half of 2003. However, The International Air Transport Authority (IATA) estimated that the 2003 SARS outbreak cost Asia Pacific carriers $6 billion in revenue. Analysts already forecast that the economic hit from coronavirus will be far greater than that of SARS, given the higher death toll and quarantine of the world’s second largest economy. Chinese Travel Demand Remains Strong To be clear, we see incredible opportunity in the travel sector. Chinese tourism has seen explosive growth over the years as incomes have risen. At the end of 2018, the size of China’s middle class stood at approximately 400 million, larger than the entire U.S. population. The number of outbound Chinese tourists in 2019 was an estimated 166 million, while travel spending topped a whopping $280 billion. Airlines globally have been cancelling services in and out of China over fears of the virus spreading further, which","Feb 21, 2020",https://www.usglobaletfs.com/insights/the-coronavirus-shouldnt-scare-airline-investors-away/

These 8 Sensex companies' valuation zoom","ANKIT GOHEL @anky_gohel Shares of SpiceJet Ltd. have fallen over 21 percent so far in 2020 but ICICI Securities sees an upside of 59 percent on the stock going ahead. The brokerage maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 140. The scrip trades at around Rs 88 on the BSE. “We believe most of the issues faced by SpiceJet are transient in nature and are likely to recover within the next six months. The extreme situation of severe liquidity crunch is unlikely considering benign crude prices and compensation expectations from Boeing,” ICICI Securities said in a report.  The airliner was able to post a net profit of Rs 78 crore in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on the back of the assumption that it will receive compensation worth Rs 246.4 crore from Boeing for expenses incurred due to the grounding of MAX aircraft. A total of 13 MAX aircraft of SpiceJet are grounded in India since a global ban on the aircraft in March 2019 following two fatal accidents involving B737 MAX planes. The airline has assumed that Boeing will pay a compensation of Rs 537.2 crore for the expenses it incurred during the April-December period on ""aircraft and supplemental lease rentals and certain other identified expenses relating to the Boeing 737 Max aircraft."" ICICI Securities believes there is a limited balance sheet risk for SpiceJet considering some tangible progress seen in the compensation talks with Boeing and a benign crude price. The brokerage expects spreads to improve for the airliner in FY21/22E driven by cost efficiency achieved from Max increase in Revenue per Available Seat-Kilometer (RASK) of around 2 percent led by modest supply growth and pickup in demand. However, the impact of novel coronavirus is a near-term risk that can impact Q4FY20 earnings, the brokerage said. “Cost performance through impressive has not been able to offset this impact on account of an older fleet in the absence of MAX. Our change in earnings expectations in FY20/21 largely stems from this lower RASK,” the brokerage said. Going ahead, it does not expect any mismatch between passenger and capacity growth as Passenger load factor (PLF) formed a low base in FY20 which should be maintainable in FY21/22E. ICICI Securities expects cost ex-fuel to decrease by 4 percent between FY19 and FY22 factoring the return of MAX sometime in FY21.

CNBC,"Some of the highest-paying dividend stocks are the worst performers this year -- Macy’s, Schlumberger, Altria, Ford and Kraft are all in the red in 2020. Is the hunt for yield worth the cost? Matt Maley, chief market technician at Miller Tabak, said at least one of those names is worth a second look. “The one that looks the best, on a technical basis anyway, is Schlumberger. It’s the only one of those names that is above its trend line going back to the middle of 2018. And it’s also the only one that’s made any kind of a higher high in the last few months,” Maley said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”  “If it can make a higher low above $30 and follow that up with another higher high above $40 that’d be really, really bullish for the name. I must admit I’m still looking for another washout in crude oil so the higher low might come still in the low $30s rather than the mid-$30s. But of all those stocks, that’s probably the one that looks the best,” said Maley. Schlumberger is currently trading at $34.13. A higher high above $40 implies at least a 17% rally from current levels. It briefly traded above $40 in early January. John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, said it’s still too early to buy into any of these stocks. “All the companies mentioned really have structural issues,” Petrides said during the same segment. “If you’re going to invest in this group of securities your question is ‘what’s your, what’s your investment intention?’ If you’re looking purely for incoming yield, I would stay away from these stocks because the quality of the income is not very high.” Macy’s, for instance, yields 9%. But, concerns over sales and viability in a changing retail space have pushed the stock 34% lower over the past 12 months. “These stocks are a show-me story first, they’re a turnaround play first, and the yield is all gravy if management gets it right,” said Petrides.

6,Coronavirus takes heavy toll on airlines and shipping firms | World news | The Guardian,Coronavirus takes heavy toll on airlines and shipping firms. How can I protect myself and others from the coronavirus outbreak?.,"Companies count cost of China flight cancellations and weaker travel demand across Asia Joanna Partridge Thu 20 Feb 2020 13.21 GMT
First published on Thu 20 Feb 2020 Air France-KLM, Qantas, and the global container shipping company Maersk have become the latest businesses to warn about the financial impact from the spread of coronavirus. The airlines have cancelled flights to and from China and are experiencing weaker demand for travel in Asia. If flights remain suspended until April, the Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM expects the Covid-19 outbreak to wipe between €150-200m (£130-170m) off its earnings.      Qantas, which predicts annual profits will be A$150m (£77m) lower, plans to reduce flights to Asia by 15% until at least the end of May. While its planes remain grounded, Australia’s flag carrier will put employees on leave and freeze recruitment. Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Qantas, said there was a similar drop in demand for flights during the Sars outbreak in 2003, which affected the airline for six to eight months. Qantas believes it can manage for at least six months without cutting jobs. “We are keeping the capability to have the rebound, keeping the aircraft, keeping the people, because we think it will happen eventually,” Joyce said.

Only the Guardian can see your contributions and one of our journalists may contact you to discuss further.   Maritime transport is also counting the cost of the outbreak. The Danish firm Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped by sea, forecasts a weak start to 2020. It has not predicted the cost of lower demand and difficulties delivering to some ports. “It is still early days to measure the overall impact,” Maersk said. “However, the weekly container vessel calls at key Chinese ports were significantly down compared [with] last year during the last weeks of January and the first weeks of February. Freight rates are expected to decrease due to dropping demand for containerised goods transport.” The Chinese government has announced new stimulus measures to support the economy.

7,Cover Story: Fear of losing Fernandes outstrips that of coronavirus for AirAsia investors | The Edge Markets,. . TRENDING NOW. Cover Story: Fear of losing Fernandes outstrips that of coronavirus for AirAsia investors. Subscribe to Mid-day,"        IT is just the second month of the year and the world is already reeling from the raging wildfires in Australia, the death of basketball legend Kobe Bryant and the Wuhan novel coronavirus epidemic. The coronavirus outbreak is said to be one of the biggest viral epidemics of the new millennium, alongside the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2005/06 and the H1N1 in 2009. To date, the death toll from the coronavirus epidemic has exceeded 600. The epidemic has almost crippled air travel in Asia, especially to and from China. Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea are some of the countries that have imposed some level of restrictions on air travel and travellers from China. The viral outbreak is bad news for airlines, which have to stop flights into and out of China, and this has caused their stocks to be battered. A comparison of Asian airline stocks shows that Singapore Airlines Ltd has lost more than 5% of its share price so far this year while Thai Airways International PCL lost 18.8% of its market value in the same period. AirAsia Group Bhd and AirAsia X Bhd (AAX) are the biggest losers so far among Asian airlines, due to the double whammy of the coronavirus and their top executives being embroiled in bribery allegations involving European aircraft maker Airbus SE. AirAsia’s stock has lost 22.9% of its market value while its long-haul arm has suffered a 16% drop in its share price up to Feb 7. Even Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Ltd, probably the largest international airline most affected by the coronavirus outbreak, suffered less than AirAsia and AAX in terms of share price changes. The airline, which recently announced no-pay leave of three weeks for all 27,000 of its staff, lost 10.2% of its value as at Feb 7. AirAsia’s share price plunged more than 19% within just three trading days — from Jan 31 to Feb 4 — to RM1.15 per share, after news broke on Feb 1 that its sole aircraft supplier, Airbus, has agreed to settle with the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over a corruption investigation. Last Tuesday, its co-founder and group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes and co-founder and executive chairman Datuk Kamarudin Meranun, allegedly being AirAsia Executive 1 and 2 named in the SFO report against Airbus, announced that they were stepping down from their","Feb 21, 2020",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-fear-losing-fernandes-outstrips-coronavirus-airasia-investors

Industry stands to lose $5 billion in revenue in first quarter,"," HONG KONG—Airlines around the world are counting the cost of the coronavirus that has led to thousands of China flights being canceled, with several Asian airlines teetering on the brink of ruin if the nation’s shutdown persists. Many carriers have taken emergency measures in hope of offsetting expected losses resulting from the continuing slump in global traffic. In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. —already feeling the impact of the city’s antigovernment protests—has asked all its staff to take three weeks’ unpaid leave, while Hong Kong Airlines Ltd. has sacked more than 400 workers. Asiana Airlines Inc., South Korea’s second largest carrier, also asked thousands of staff to take unpaid leave. Even flights not passing through China have been axed from schedules. Australia’s Qantas Airways Ltd. said Thursday it was reducing services to Hong Kong and Singapore in addition to suspending flights to mainland China until at least the end of May, while Thai Airways International PCL has cut flights connecting Bangkok with Seoul and Singapore, as regional customers lose their appetite for travel. China’s rise to the world’s second busiest aviation market after the U.S. has been a strong source of growth for all the world’s major airlines, which have expanded direct services to Chinese destinations in recent years, some offering dozens of flights a week. American Airlines Group Inc.’s namesake carrier, for example, normally operates 28 weekly flights between the U.S. and China. But that has left them badly exposed to major disruption in China. As the epidemic worsened, many foreign airlines, including the major U.S. carriers, completely halted flights to Chinese destinations last month.","Feb 20, 2020",https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-epidemic-buffets-global-airlines-11582215097

FMAGX delivered average annual total returns of more than 29% to fund investors during his 13-year tenure, clobbering the stock market by over 13 percentage points. A $10,000 investment in Fidelity Magellan Fund starting when Lynch took the reins would have grown to nearly $280,000 by the time he departed. Lynch attributed his success to investing principles he shared in One Up on Wall Street and Beating the Street. His overall strategy, based on a few core concepts, is surprisingly simple. A few of the most salient points: With that in mind, here are 10 stock picks with Peter Lynch qualities. Some of these companies have one or more of the aforementioned traits, while some possess other qualities that the legendary investor prized. 1 of 10 Getty Images Tens of millions of visitors come to Disney theme parks every year, but the company's greatest treasure might be its media library. Walt Disney owns the popular Star Wars and Marvel movie franchises, as well as ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel. When it purchased 20th Century Fox's assets, it picked up thousands of films, not to mention the FX station, a 73% stake in National Geographic Partners and 30% of Hulu, which, added to its own stake, gave it majority ownership. As Disney continues to buy up media assets, it's consolidating power within the movie and TV arenas, giving it a powerful competitive advantage. Moreover, Disney now is monetizing its content library via the Disney+ streaming service, with a goal of acquiring 90 million Disney+ subscribers by year-end 2024. That adds recurring revenue, which Lynch also favored. Disney is expanding into retail, too, via a partnership with Target (TGT). It opened 25 stores-inside-a-store in 2019 and is looking to open 40 more by October 2020. Disney is hardly cheap, trading at 22.6 times analysts' estimates for next year's earnings. However, once you factor in growth expectations for next year as well as dividends, you get to a dividend-adjusted PEG of 1.4. Any stock picks with a PEG greater than 1 are technically considered overpriced, but Lynch writes in One Up on Wall Street: ""In general, a P/E that's half the growth rate is very positive, and one that's twice the growth rate is very negative.""

PAL,"Philippine Airlines (PR, Manila Ninoy Aquino Int'l) raised its authorised capital stock from PHP13 billion pesos (USD256 million) to PHP30 billion (USD592 million) on February 18, its parent PAL Holdings confirmed in a stock exchange disclosure the following day. The move, approved at a meeting by a majority of the company's stockholders, is part of a strategy to sustain profitability and maintain competitiveness, local media reported Philippine Airlines' president and chief operating officer Gilbert Santa Maria as saying. PAL Holdings, which also owns Air Philippines (2P, Manila Ninoy Aquino Int'l), also said in the filing that Chinese Filipino billionaire Lucio Tan had taken over as group president, replacing his namesake son who died in November 2019. The position is concurrent with Tan's existing role as chairman. Also, the number of directors at PAL Holdings will increase from nine to eleven. In November, PAL Holdings posted a net loss of PHP7.86 billion (USD155 million) for the first nine months of 2019, a steep fall from the PHP3.29 billion (USD65 million) loss for the same period in 2018. The company blamed the result on an 8.8% rise in maintenance costs, among other factors. In January 2019, ANA - All Nippon Airways (NH, Tokyo Haneda) acquired a 9.5% stake in PAL Holdings for USD95 million. No definite decision has been made on the future of privately-owned flag carrier, Philippine Airlines (PR, Manila Ninoy Aquino Int'l), according to its parent company, PAL Holdings.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   The post Dropkick Murphys and Rancid Announce New Co-Headlining Tour Dates appeared first on Consequence of Sound. Dropkick Murphys and Rancid are teaming up for the “Boston to Berkeley II Tour” across North America this spring. The co-headlining run is the second time the punk acts have teamed up after their initial trek together in 2017. Scottish singer-songwriter Gerry Cinnamon and Jesse Ahern will support the tour, which kicks off May 3rd at Epicenter Festival in Concord, North Carolina, and ends on May 24th in Lewiston, New York. The name of the tour refers to the bands’ hometowns — Boston for Dropkick Murphys and Berkeley for Rancid — and not the actual tour routing. The route hits a number of major markets, including additional festival appearances at Welcome to Rockville on May 8th and Sonic Temple on May 17th. “We’re excited to team up with our old friends Rancid again for the second edition of the Boston To Berkeley tour,” Dropkick Murphys’ Ken Casey said in a press release. “And we’ll be joined by Glasgow, Scotland superstar Gerry Cinnamon – on his first U.S. tour!” Rancid’s Lars Frederiksen added: “Looking forward to getting out with the Dropkick Murphys again… This is one you won’t wanna miss.” Dropkick Murphys and Rancid will alternate closing out shows, with both bands getting together for a jam and the end of the night. It’s fitting the two acts find themselves touring together deep into their successful careers. It was Frederiksen who helped the Dropkick Murphys get a record deal after passing their debut EP on to Rancid bandmate Tim Armstrong for his Hellcat Records imprint. As previously reported, Dropkick Murphys will precede the newly announced tour with a run of shows in the Boston area during the week of St. Patrick’s Day.

About The Author / Staff. . Comment. Leave","    BBTV sees Insider Buying Is Burcon Nutrascience still cheap? Healthcare stock picks from Mackie       “If it’s going to affect Air Canada, it’ll affect Chorus to some extent but that’s kind of far out there. Maybe that’s why the stock has come off because of that, because all the airline stocks and travel stocks have been hit,” says Kee, senior vice-president and portfolio manager for Cardinal Capital, who spoke to BNN Bloomberg on Thursday. “But I can’t imagine it’s going to affect them very much,” he says. “I think that dividend is okay.” Shares of Chorus Aviation have struggled in recent weeks, along with the rest of the air travel sector, a disappointing turn for a stock that had been on the rise, if slowly, over 2019. Chorus, which operates as Air Canada’s regional service along with having an aircraft leasing business, got a contract extension from Air Canada last January, which firmed up the company’s future and gave a boost to its share price. CHR climbed 43 per cent in 2019 and had been rising over the first couple of weeks of 2020 before the coronavirus outbreak started impacting the sector. Earlier this week, Australia’s Qantas and Air France both announced that the outbreak would impact their upcoming quarterly results, with many airlines suspending flights to mainland China and air travellers being more reluctant to book flights into surrounding Asian regions as well. “Coronavirus resulted in the suspension of our flights to mainland China and we're now seeing some secondary impacts with weaker demand on Hong Kong, Singapore and to a lesser extent Japan,” said Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce to BBC News. Earlier on Friday, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) released a statement saying that dropping passenger demand related to the coronavirus outbreak would likely cost the airline industry almost $30 billion in lost revenues this year, with the majority of those losses hitting airlines in the Asia Pacific region. “The sharp downturn in demand as a result of Covid-19 will have a financial impact on airlines – severe for those particularly exposed to the China market,” read the IATA statement. “These estimates are based on a scenario where Covid-19 has a similar V-shaped impact on demand as was experienced during Sars. That was characterised by a six-month period with a sharp decline followed by an equally quick","Feb 21, 2020",https://www.cantechletter.com/2020/02/chorus-aviation-will-feel-the-pressure-from-coronavirus-this-fund-manager-says/
