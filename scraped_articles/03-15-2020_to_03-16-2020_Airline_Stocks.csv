0,Thinking About Airline Stocks? There’s a Lesson From China. | Barron's,"Here’s How Air Travel Is Recovering in China.. . . 8 Hardware Stocks to Buy for 2021, According to Morgan","    Weary investors are trying to figure out what comes next for the airline sector. In a presentation at the J.P. Morgan transportation investor conference last week. Aengus Kelly, CEO of the aircraft lessor AerCap Holdings, offered up some points to consider, with a historical perspective and a real-time look at what is happening in China.  Airline investors have had to endure a lot lately. Airline shares—battered by the Covid-19 outbreak—are down by between 23% and 50% year to date. The average 44% drop is far worse than comparable declines of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. The most heavily indebted among the domestic carriers, American Airlines (ticker: AAL), is performing the worst. The most financially flexible, Southwest Airlines (LUV), is performing the best. None of the airline stocks, however, are doing very well. Investors are wrestling with just how bad air travel will get and what the recovery will look like. Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian wrote a memo to employees Friday, saying in part that, “demand for travel is declining at an accelerated pace daily, driving an unprecedented revenue impact.” This is as bad as any situation airlines have faced. Delta is reducing capacity by 40% over the next few months, putting 300 planes on the ground because they don’t need them. Delta has about 900 jets in its fleet. “ AerCap disclosed details on how daily flights evolved throughout the crisis so far in China,” wrote J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker in a Tuesday research report. “As it is one of the major three air traffic markets in the world.” The numbers: There were about 14,600 daily flights in China on Jan. 2. The figure grew to 16,000 as Lunar New Year approached, but there were only 4,000 flights on Feb. 20, at the peak of the Covid-19 crisis in China. There were 8,000 flights as of March 5. Capacity dropped 70% at its nadir and is up 100% since then. Capacity is still off about 45% from normal, but some Chinese airline stocks are up—barely—off the lows. Looking ahead, Kelly noted that air traffic has doubled every 15 years, despite other shocks. He doesn’t see any structural changes, long term, because of the viral outbreak. AerCap (AER), as a lessor, owns planes and rents them out to global airlines. Its shares have been hammered too, down 60% year","Mar 16, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/thinking-about-airline-stocks-theres-a-lesson-from-china-51584357300

3,Airline stocks jump after Trump pledges 100% backstop,Trump pledges to backstop airlines ’100%′ in coronavirus response. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"President Donald Trump said Monday he plans to back the airline industry “100%” as it’s been roiled by the coronavirus pandemic.  “We’re going to back the airlines 100% − it’s not their fault,” he said. “We’ll be backstopping the airlines and helping them very much,” he later added. Airline shares came off their lows on Trump’s remarks, though most of them closed at fresh multi-year lows. Delta, United and Southwest closed down 6.6%, 14.8% and 9.1% American Airlines, which was higher before Trump’s comments, closed at the highs of the day amid the press conference, up 9%. It has the most debt of its peers.  U.S. airlines are seeking government assistance of more than $50 billion, including a mix of direct aid and loan guarantees, as the industry reels from the coronavirus outbreak. Airlines for America, which represents carriers including Delta, United, American and Southwest, have recommended passenger carriers immediately receive up to $25 billion in grants to compensate for reduced liquidity and in the medium term $25 billion in low- or zero-interest loans. Trump did not confirm the size and structure of the aid the administration plans on offering the industry but did say he has communicated with the airlines his plans to help them. “We’ve told the airlines we are going to be helping them,” Trump said.  Trump’s words of support for the airline industry come as Congress is already discussing the third package to help ailing companies, states and individuals stricken by the virus. A second package was passed by the House this weekend but has yet to go through Senate. The next package may be monumental in size.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is planning his own aid proposal of at least $750 billion. It would money to help individuals and small businesses, including forbearance on federal loans, a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, assistance for small businesses and emergency child care. The next package may also be politically thorny in an election year, particularly as the pain becomes so widespread. The airline industry has argued, though, the challenges they are facing are not self-inflicted, unlike that which the banks faced in 2008. “It’s not their fault − it’s nobody’s fault unless you go to the original source. But it’s nobody’s fault, and we’re going to be in a position to help the airlines very much,” said Trump.

4,Why Shares of Airlines Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Airlines Are Falling Today. An international consulting firm is warning of dire consequences for the global industry,"   Shares of airline stocks continued their descent on Monday, battered by a fresh round of capacity cuts and talk of financial collapse. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) opened down more than 18% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) was down 15%, with shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) all down 10% or more. The COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak has caused global travel demand to evaporate and has left airlines scrambling to cut costs as quickly as possible. Over the weekend American and United each announced dramatic capacity reductions, following a similar announcement by Delta on Friday. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The outbreak is expected to cost global airlines more than $100 billion in revenue, and with U.S. school districts shutting down and local governments urging citizens to practice social distancing for weeks to months to come, travel is unlikely to normalize quickly. United said the virus-related revenue impact for March alone could be as high as $1.5 billion. With so much uncertainty, many industry watchers are fearing the worst. Australian consulting firm CAPA - Centre for Aviation put out a report Monday warning that absent government intervention, ""most"" of the world's airlines could be in bankruptcy by the end of May. ""Coordinated government and industry action is needed -- now -- if catastrophe is to be avoided,"" CAPA wrote. The longer this goes, the more dangerous it is for the airlines. Fortunately, all of the large companies have shown in recent days they still have access to liquidity, and the airlines have billions in unencumbered assets they can borrow against. The U.S. government has said it is preparing to act to try to prop up the industry. I still believe the U.S. airlines can weather the storm without bankruptcies, but with each passing day the threat is growing, especially for smaller carriers like JetBlue and Hawaiian. And even if the companies can survive without bankruptcy, it is going to be hard for the stocks to find a bottom until some signs emerge that the outbreak is under control and travel can return to normal.

Investing legend and Motley Fool Co-founder Tom Gardner just revealed what he believes are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and JetBlue Airways Corporation wasn't one","Mar 16, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/16/why-shares-of-airlines-are-falling-today.aspx

Adams Financial Concepts LLC.,"03/16/2020 5:00 am EST Focus: TRANSPORTATION Frank Holmes CEO and CIO, U.S. Global Investors, Inc. Airline stocks are on sale; indeed the stocks are the most discounted since 9/11, notes Frank Holmes, CEO of US Global Investors and editor of Frank Talk. Ever on the hunt for a great bargain, billionaire investor Warren Buffett boosted his company’s stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL) once again. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) acquired some 976,000 Delta shares last week for roughly $45.3 million, according to a filing on Monday, raising its total holdings to 17.9 million shares. This was enough to bring Buffett’s ownership of the U.S. long-haul carrier up to more than 11 percent. Once a critic of airline stocks, Buffett has become one of their greatest champions, noting the industry’s strong fundamentals and the fact that it’s protected by an economic moat. Accumulating shares now appears to be a strategic move to capitalize on lower fuel costs — Brent crude oil is down 30 percent so far this year — as well as coronavirus-impacted travel, which has depressed airline stock prices. Buffett isn’t alone in thinking airlines look like a steal right now. In a note to clients this week, Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent maintained his Buy ratings on Delta, United Airlines (UAL) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE), writing that “if coronavirus concerns fade in the coming weeks and the U.S. is able to avoid recession, this scenario could see a recovery in ex-Asia demand, which could lead airline stock prices and earnings streams to stabilize.” What’s more, the domestic airline industry could soon receive fiscal stimulus in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic. Speaking to various business news networks last Friday, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow hinted that the U.S. government is considering “timely and targeted micro-measures” for certain industries, including airlines, hospitality and agricultural. As one the most exposed industries to global travel disruptions, airlines have seen a deeper selloff than the market and now look like an attractive bargain. So far, COVID-19 has had a far greater impact on global airline stocks than the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic did. The chart below shows the daily percent change of the NYSE Arca Global Airlines Index starting on the day of the first reported incident of either infection — November 15, 2002 in the case of SARS, December 31, 2019 in the case of COVID-19.

RELATED," Fund managers are counting the cost of their holding in airline companies as shares in the travel sector have plunged amid the coronavirus pandemic. Airline stocks are among the hardest in today’s renewed heavy falls across stock markets. British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) has fallen to the bottom of the FTSE 100 today, losing a quarter of its value, while EasyJet (EZJ) is down 16.8%, ‘mid-cap’ airline stock Wizz Air (WIZZ) has fallen 20.2% and on the Alternative Investment Market, Dart Group (DTG), which operates the Jet2 airline, is down 40%. Over the last month, International Consolidated Airlines is down 59%, nearly double the FTSE 100’s 30% loss. EasyJet has fallen 56%, Wizz Air has halved in value and Dart Group is down 73%. That has hurt a number of fund managers backing the stocks. Neil Veitch and Craig Jeruzal’s SVM UK Opportunties fund has been among the heaviest fallers in the Investment UK All Companies sector in the sell-off, losing 30.5% in the 15 trading days to Friday. The managers held 5.7% of the £115m fund in Ryanair (RYA.I), down 40% over the last month, 4.1% in Wizz Air and 3.9% in IAG at the end of February, according to the latest factsheet. SVM World Equity, also managed by Veitch, has an even larger Ryanair holding, at 6.1%% of the £19m fund at the end of February.

9,Is This Canadian Airline Stock a Buy Today? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Is This Canadian Airline Stock a Buy Today?. Earnings report. Valuation. Foolish,"      Nicholas Dobroruka | March 15, 2020 | More on: AC After seeing the S&P/TSX Composite Index drop almost 10% during the last two weeks of February, things have not looked any better through the first half of March. The coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is largely responsible for these dramatic fluctuations in price. As the global impact of the virus continues to increase, investors are showing that they would prefer to be on the sidelines until positive news begins to circulate. The travel industry has been taking a beating, as many people across the globe are canceling trips to avoid the virus. Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) can attest to that, as the stock is down 45% since the beginning of 2020. But it isn’t just the coronavirus that Air Canada has to blame. After the stock price ran up 80% in 2019, investors were largely underwhelmed with the 2019 Q4 report announced in February. Revenue came in slightly lower than expected, but the adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.17 was far below the expected $0.38. There’s no question that Air Canada began 2020 facing strong global headwinds. In addition to COVID-19, the company is still dealing with the business impact of a worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX in 2019. Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu is expecting a 2020 Q3 return for the plane. Another catalyst for the steep drop in stock price was the guidance management gave for 2020. In addition to missing 2019 Q4 estimates, the company addressed the significant headwinds that will be faced during 2020. Management projects 2020 Q1 EDBITDA to be roughly $200 million below where it was in Q1 of 2019. The company may have a volatile year ahead of it, but management had an optimistic attitude during the conference call about the future of the company. The Air Transat merger has yet to be factored into any guidance, as it is still in the approval process. Management believes that the added airline will benefit both customers and shareholders through new travel options and benefits. A new loyalty program is also set to be launched at some point during 2020. Although the company has not yet released many details surrounding the program, Calin Rovinescu confidently noted during the earnings call that he expects it to be a top-tier loyalty program. The future may be uncertain for the","Mar 15, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/03/15/is-this-canadian-airline-stock-a-buy-today/

Worst day since. The stock has heard a lot of that over the past few weeks. The market outdid itself again Monday, though not in a good way. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,997 points. That’s the index’s biggest point drop of all time, eclipsing the 2,352-point fall it had on Thursday. For the second time in just three days, the market plunged the most percentage-wise since Oct. 19, 1987. Monday’s 12.9% drop in the Dow ranks third only to the 22.6% plunge in 1987 and a 13.5% drop in October 1929. The stock market’s nosedive came as voices from Wall Street to the White House said the coronavirus outbreak is likely dragging the economy into a recession. The Trump administration joined many state and local governments in encouraging people to practice “social distancing” and to avoid large gatherings. “The real fear is going to be if people are going into hibernation, how long will that be and we have no way of having any knowledge to answer that question,” said Adam Taback, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Wealth Management. EDITORS: This item was corrected to say the Dow had its third-largest percentage drop Monday, not the second largest. ___ 3:30 p.m. The nation’s largest banks face a hit to their profits as the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates and bond yields continue sliding amid the coronavirus pandemic, which is putting the brakes on the economy as businesses and travel shut down. Banks like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and others rely on interest from mortgages and other kinds of loans to make their profits, so when those rates fall sharply, so do their earnings. Yields on bonds like the 10-year Treasury note are used to set rates on mortgages, and those yields have been dropping, pushing mortage rates to record lows. Citi analyst Keith Horowitz expects the low rates to put pressure on the bank finances over the next few years. He estimates a 4% contraction in profits for Bank of America in 2020, followed by no growth next year. Other large banks face similar results. Bank shares have taken a serious hit so far this year. Bank of America has plummeted 40% while JPMorgan plunged 35%.
