How to Buy,"Delta Air Lines has proven to be a resilient corporate entity throughout its 91-year existence. From bankruptcies to mergers and acquisitions, the company has endured in good times and bad times, in wartime and in peace. Delta rebounded even after its stock delisted in 2005 after a tough period and relisted in 2007 — and even had its best 12-year stretch in its history.  By the end of 2019, Delta will have generated more cash flow than any other year in its history. Needless to say, the company is on the upswing.

is one of the premier commercial airline carriers in the world. Collett E. Woolman founded the company in 1928, but passenger transport was not the initial focus. Huff Daland Dusters, the precursor to Delta, began as a crop-dusting operation, primarily eliminating pesky insects from Georgia peach orchards and cotton fields in neighboring southeastern states. It was the first commercial aerial agricultural company in existence.    The rebranded company transported its first passengers, going from Texas to Mississippi. The company later began transporting mail for what was then known as the Post Office Department. After legislation turned over mail delivery to private businesses, Delta’s service stalled. With a new Post Office contract in 1934, the company resumed passenger service and became operating as Delta Air Lines.  Delta later served in the war effort and the years following had several firsts in the industry. During the 1950s, the company spearheaded the use of airline hubs — a centralized airport for passengers to connect to other Delta flights.  Several mergers and acquisitions occurred over the next 50 years, including with Chicago and Southern Air Lines in 1953, Northeast Airlines in 1972 and Northwest Airlines in 2007. Each transaction expanded the company’s reach and fueled its growth. That growth includes servicing nearly 200 million passengers each year on more than 15,000 daily flights, with its 80,000 worldwide employees overseeing it all. It also services 304 worldwide destinations in 52 countries. Delta’s growing business hasn’t come without major stumbling blocks. In 2005, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.","Dec 4, 2019",https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-buy-delta-stock/

MORE. Your Market","   AP  United Airlines shares rose as much as 1% in early Thursday trading after the company announced CEO Oscar Munoz will step down and President Scott Kirby will take his place. The transition will take place in May, with Munoz becoming the airline's executive chairman. Current chairman Jane Garvey will retire from the company's board. ""With United in a stronger position than ever, now is the right time to begin the process of passing the baton to a new leader,"" Munoz said in a statement. ""One of my goals as CEO was to put in place a successful leadership transition for United Airlines.""  Kirby was hired by Munoz in August 2016 after serving as president of American Airlines. The CEO-to-be assisted American Airlines CEO Doug Parker in creating the nation's largest airline through mergers with US Air and America West. Munoz's tenure as chief executive saw the airline recover from back-to-back scandals in 2017 and 2018. United was mired in controversy after security officers dragged a passenger off of an overbooked flight. A video of the event went viral and prompted the CEO to issue a public apology. The airline's reputation was further marred in 2018 when a flight attendant had a passenger place their dog in an overhead bin. The pet died on the flight from New York to Houston, and Munoz issued another apology, vowing United would improve in how it treats its customers. The company has since improved its image for shareholders, boosting net profit to $2.5 billion by the end of 2018 from $2.1 billion in 2017. United's net income over the first three quarters of 2019 has already reached $2.4 billion, and the airline raised its full-year profit forecast in its October earnings report. United closed at $88.17 per share Wednesday, up 5.3% year-to-date.  The airline has 14 ""buy"" ratings, seven ""hold"" ratings, and no ""sell"" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $109.17, according to Bloomberg data.

A Different,"For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 48% over a half decade. And it's not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 40% in the last year. There was little comfort for shareholders in the last week as the price declined a further 3.0%. View our latest analysis for Spirit Airlines While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. While the share price declined over five years, Spirit Airlines actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 12% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past. Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement. In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 14% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity. You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below. We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. You can see what analysts are predicting for Spirit Airlines in this interactive graph of future profit estimates. While the broader market gained around 16% in the last year, Spirit Airlines shareholders lost 40%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 12% over the last half decade. We realise that Buffett has said investors should 'buy when there is blood on","Dec 4, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-save/spirit-airlines/news/those-who-purchased-spirit-airlines-nysesave-shares-five-years-ago-have-a-48-loss-to-show-for-it

Scott Kirby will take over in May; he,"United Airlines Holding Inc. said its chief executive, Oscar Munoz, will step down after four-and-a-half years at the helm, promoting an air-travel veteran to continue one of the industry’s biggest turnarounds. Scott Kirby, who joined United from American Airlines Group Inc. three years ago, will assume the top job in May, the Chicago-based carrier said Thursday. The leadership change follows sustained improvements in the company’s performance, plus aggressive growth—overseen by Mr. Kirby—that moved United past American to become the second-largest U.S. carrier by traffic. Strong profit has helped the company’s stock outperform that of rivals. United has beat analysts’ earnings expectations in 11 of the past 12 quarters.

ver thirty years of working in and around financial markets has turned me into a bit of a news junkie. That is kind of inevitable. So much of life in a dealing room revolves around waiting for, digesting and reacting to news that every snippet of information takes on an exaggerated importance in your mind, and now, as a writer on the subject, nothing makes me look more foolish than missing a piece of news that is relevant to the subject at hand. The problem with that read-and-react style comes when the real news is not what you might think from the headline alone, or when another, contradictory story follows quickly. Both of those things have happened over the last few days with Mesa Air Group (MESA). As a result, even after jumping twenty percent over the last two days, the stock still looks like value. Mesa is based in Phoenix and is one of those airlines that not many people, even regular travelers, are probably aware of as they generally operate flights for other airlines, primarily United (UAL) and American (AAL). The rollercoaster ride for Mesa investors started on Tuesday, when the company announced that they had failed to meet certain performance criteria included in their American Airlines contract. On the surface, that was obviously bad news and it seemed that it had come at the worst possible time. Mesa had hinted at the problems back in August at the same time as they reported that negotiations for contract renewal with United were hitting snags and taking a lot longer than originally anticipated. When that news came out at the time of their earnings release, the stock dropped forty-five percent in two days, so it is no surprise that on confirmation of the problems with AAL on Tuesday, MESA initially shed over six percent. As you can see from the chart, however, it made up that ground and significantly more over the next two days. Two things happened. First, the “bad” news regarding American turned out to be not so bad at all. Then, the contract negotiations with United that had dragged on so long ended, with Mesa’s contract being renewed and extended. The failure to meet American’s performance standards gave them the right to remove two of Mesa’s jets from its fleet. American Airlines, however, decided to defer that option, but did remove one plane from a previous","Dec 5, 2019",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mesa-airlines-mesa%3A-is-this-stock-ready-for-takeoff-2019-12-05

Here’s how one technical analyst is trading it. MORE,"Advanced Micro Devices has not only more than doubled its share price this year, TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon said it has also finally broken out of a nearly two-decade resistance. The technician says the chip stock has moved out of a resistance that sat at around the $38 level since 2000, and that the recent rally has finally taken AMD above that mark.  Not only that, but it’s a sign that the surging shares have more room to run. “This has been one of the best-performing stocks in my portfolio,” he said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “I think we have more upside to go as this name continues to catch market share from its largest competitors.” To take advantage of AMD’s breakout, Gordon wants to buy the February monthly 40-strike calls and sell the February monthly 45-strike calls for a debit of $1.85. This means that if AMD closes below $40 on Feb. 21 expiration, Gordon could risk the $185 he paid for the trade. But if AMD closes above $45 on Feb. 21, then Gordon would make $315 on the trade. AMD has soared 116% this year, outperforming the semiconductors ETF () which has rallied about 51%. Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

USD/JPY.,"                                                    Three years after being dumped by a rival, Scott Kirby will become the next CEO of United Airlines, where he has played a key role in leading a turnaround of the once-moribund carrier. United announced Thursday that CEO Oscar Munoz will step down in May and be succeeded by Kirby, currently the airline’s president. Munoz has led the airline since 2015 during a tumultuous time that included the brutal dragging of a passenger off an overcrowded plane and an aggressive growth plan designed to recapture United’s glory days. Munoz recruited Kirby days after he was ousted as the No. 2 official at American Airlines, where he was widely considered a future CEO. Kirby has figured prominently in decisions including a refresh of United’s fleet and a bold plan — initially resisted by Wall Street — to aggressively add new routes from its hub airports such as Chicago and San Francisco. “When he arrived, United was a hot mess,” said travel analyst Henry Harteveldt. “Scott has focused on improving United reliability and productivity, and it’s a much more reliable airline than it used to be.” Kirby, 52, will lead one of the world’s biggest airlines just as investors wonder whether the historically volatile industry can continue to post strong profits. United faces narrower challenges including a number of union labor contracts coming up for negotiation and the ongoing grounding of its Boeing 737 Max jets, which has caused the airline to cancel thousands of flights since March. Kirby left American Airlines in mid-2016 in what the company described as part of its long-term succession planning. In effect, Kirby was passed over as the heir apparent to CEO Doug Parker in favor of Robert Isom, then American’s chief operating officer. Insiders at American never doubted Kirby’s industry knowledge and intelligence — he claims to have been kicked out of casinos 150 times for counting the cards played in blackjack games — but they say his personality could be abrasive at times.

InterGlobe Aviation,"," Shares of InterGlobe Aviation fell over 6% on Thursday after the airline lowered its capacity growth guidance for FY'20 and designated the 'A320neo issue' as one of the 'revenue headwinds' of 2019-20. Reacting to the presentation submitted post-market hours on Wednesday, the share price of IndiGo opened 1.5% lower today and later fell 6.31% to the day's low of Rs 1,316.55, against the previous close of Rs 1,405.20 on BSE. Market depth data on BSE suggested 95% selling compared to 5% buying on the stock. In terms of volume, 4.81 and 32.71 lakh shares changed hands on BSE and NSE. InterGlobe Aviation shares trades lower than 5, 20, 50, 100 as well as 200-day moving averages. The share price of IndiGo has declined more than 7% in one week and over 8% in one month. InterGlobe Aviation, the parent firm of IndiGo, pointed out multiple factors while listing out the 'revenue headwinds' for the present fiscal in its investor presentation. This included pilot shortage, the NEO issue and uncertainty around the slots and bilateral rights that belonged to Jet Airways, which can lead to lower utilisation and shorter booking window. The airline added these headwinds were likely to disappear by summer of 2020. IndiGo said it was working with the manufacturers Pratt & Whitney and Airbus to acquire sufficient spare engines and 'mitigate the risk', after regulator DGCA ordered the low-cost carrier to replace engines of all its A320neo aircraft before January 31. The airline highlighted this matter as one of the 'revenue headwinds' of 2019-20 and said that the same is likely to have an impact on future capacity. ""Company expects its capacity to grow by 22-23% for FY20,"" the filing said. This was lower as compared to the earlier stated guidance of 25%, which was announced during September quarter earnings. The company has lowered its capacity growth guidance for the second time since October 24, 2019, when the airline submitted its unaudited standalone and consolidated financial results for the quarter and half-year ended September 30, 2019. Consequently, the airline said maintenance cost, which was recorded at Rs 1,530 crore in Q2 FY20, will remain at elevated levels till FY22. ""Despite the mark-to-market (MTM) hit on capitalised lease liabilities, we expect our profits to be similar to Q3 FY19 in Q3 FY20,"" the filing added.
