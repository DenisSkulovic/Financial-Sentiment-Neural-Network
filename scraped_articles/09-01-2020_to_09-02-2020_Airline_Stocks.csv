0,Airline Stocks Are a Mess. Why Southwest Might Be as Good as It Gets. | Barron's,Airline Stocks Are a Mess. Why Southwest Might Be as Good as It Gets.. . . A Southwest Airlines plane,"    If you’re looking for an airline stock to buy, consider Southwest Airlines. The stock is a “less leaky equity bucket” than rivals, according to Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik, which may be as good as it gets in the sector these days. Yanoshik upgraded Southwest (ticker: LUV) to a Buy rating on Tuesday, granting it a $45 price target, up from recent prices around $38. He downgraded American Airlines Group (AAL) to a Sell and Delta Air Lines (DAL) to a Hold, and maintained a Hold rating on United Airlines (UAL). Alaska Air (ALK), meanwhile, joined American, United, and Delta in dropping change fees (to varying degrees). That leaves JetBlue Airways (JBLU), Spirit Airlines (SAVE), and Allegiant Travel (ALGT) as the last major carriers to maintain change fees (along with privately held Frontier Airlines), though all are waiving the fees temporarily. Eliminating change fees could help stimulate demand, but it’s also likely to intensify competition between the legacy and ultra-low-cost carriers, making for more competitive pricing in economy-class fares. Fees aside, airlines are approaching the limits of cuts to capital expenditures and operating costs, Yanoshik writes. Cash-flow break-even is getting pushed further into the distance, even with steep capacity cuts likely this fall. Airlines are likely to furlough tens of thousands of workers after Sept. 30, when payroll support under the Cares Act expires, assuming they don’t receive an extension of federal aid (which appears stalled in Congress). United, for instance, notified employees on Wednesday that it plans to cut 16,370 jobs through involuntary furloughs as soon as October 1. The cuts are less than the 36,000 United said it may cut in July, after payroll support expires. But it will still be a deep cut: United had 95,000 employees at the start of the year, with about 7,000 already planning to leave the airline. United also urged employees to pressure Congress to extend payroll support, writing that “an extension would be the one thing that would prevent involuntary furloughs.” With leisure travel driving the recovery and corporate volumes still down 90%, there doesn’t appear to be much of a catalyst for demand near-term. Airlines are now urging airports and governments to adopt rapid-test procedures and temperature checks to alleviate fears of catching Covid-19 on a plane. New rapid test kits may soon be mass-marketed, including a newly approved test from Abbott Laboratories (ABT). That could help","Sep 2, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/southwest-may-be-as-good-as-it-gets-for-airlines-analyst-says-51599059550

2,Airline stocks set to soar after Labor Day or lose altitude? This top analyst reveals her big call,. . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD.,"                                                    Airline stocks may have too much altitude underneath them given the ongoing realities of the COVID-19 pandemic. “No, I mean, think about it. We’re going into the fall and we are going into a point of time when corporate travel takes over from leisure travel. August is usually a very strong leisure month, and I think we saw that with about 800,000 people traveling. September we don’t think you will see that because corporations aren’t travel,” Cowen managing director and senior airlines analyst Helane Becker told Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade on whether the big run-ups in the sector of late are warranted. To be sure, the speculators descended on the battered airline space in August. Shares of Delta (+23% in August), Southwest (+23), American Airlines (+18%), and JetBlue (+12%) all notched solid gains in August. The NYSE Arca Airline Index — which measures the performance of airline stocks — rose about 18% in August. The S&P 500 gained 7.5% in the month. The ARCA even outperformed the red-hot Nasdaq Composite in August — it only increased 11% in value. The moves come despite the prospect for more airline industry layoffs this fall, dreadful third and fourth quarters on tap and no fresh round of government stimulus. Next up could be renewed bankruptcy chatter, which could place pressure on airline stocks. Says Becker, “I don’t think what you saw last month necessarily reflects what’s happening in real-time. I think what you saw last month was some hope that the government would step in and provide additional financing to the airlines through March of next year, which was obviously still pending.” Indeed the raw data on travel underscores Becker’s concern on airline stocks amid the pandemic. Checkpoint numbers for August 31 out of the Transportation Security Administration came in at 711,178, down sharply 2.3 million for the same week a year ago. The closely watched TSA data showed little improvement from the start of August until the close of the month.

According to research by UBS, over 50% of the respondents to its survey said they would not travel for three months or more. The Swiss banking giant interviewed 6,000 people, split equally between the UK, Germany, France and the US in July and August. Overall, the outlook for the next 12 months looks better with an 8% reduction seen in leisure flights a 17% fall in business travel predicted. UBS says the year-on-year shift is slightly less than it had anticipated internally, which perhaps bodes well for the industry. In the year-to-date, British Airways owner IAG (LON:IAG) has lost two-thirds of its value. It is reportedly burning through £20mln a day, is in a deadlock with the unions and has been forced to tap the market for £1.4bn. The workforce challenges aren’t quite so difficult for budget carrier easyJet (LON:EZJ). Even so, the shares have plummeted 57% since the start of the year amid worries over the leisure travel market.

4,Why Airline Shares Soared Higher in August | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Soared Higher in August. The stocks reacted to some positive developments in the industry's slow recovery from,"   It's been a tough year for the airline industry, with the COVID-19 pandemic decimating travel demand and causing carriers to scramble to cut costs. Airline stocks were hit hard early in the crisis, and in the months since have been moving up and down based on developments in the fight to put COVID-19 behind us. August brought a wave of mostly optimistic headlines about the effort to find a COVID-19 vaccine as well as some positive talk from Washington about additional financial support for the airlines, and the stocks moved higher as a result. Leading the way for the month was Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), up 23.5% according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) were up 21.7% and 17.4%, respectively.  AIRLINE DATA BY YCHARTS The U.S. airline industry saw second-quarter revenue decline by nearly 80% from a year prior, and the traffic is unlikely to come back until there is a COVID-19 vaccine. Airline stocks gained in August on headlines concerning the development of a new quick COVID-19 test that could help reassure uncertain flyers, as well as milestones in vaccine development that suggest we could have a resolution sooner than initially feared. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In the meantime, there are some indications coming out of Washington that lawmakers are open to including the airlines in a second round of COVID-19 stimulus if it means avoiding layoffs. The airlines are bleeding cash during the pandemic, and any additional financial assistance provided by the government would lengthen their runways before they face liquidity issues. The airlines also figure to benefit from a loosening of international travel restrictions, though even with government approval, few are flying internationally at this time. August was a good month, but the stocks are still down between 30% and 55% year to date. Which seems appropriate, given the challenges the industry still faces. A vaccine will arrive eventually, and when it does, I am optimistic travel will begin to return. But in the meantime, expect the industry to get smaller. American has warned it will have to cut 40,000 jobs this fall if there is no additional government assistance, and Delta said it will have to let go of up to 1,941 pilots. Southwest is hopeful of avoiding layoffs, but only because 25% of its workforce has agreed to take extended leave","Sep 2, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/02/why-airline-shares-soared-higher-in-august/
5,Buy Alert: American Airlines Stock Is Headed Higher | The Motley Fool,Buy Alert: American Airlines Stock Is Headed Higher. The airline industry could potentially experience a massive recovery in the imminent,"   COVID-19 has undoubtedly decimated the airline industry due to border closures, safety concerns, high unemployment levels, and business austerity. Indeed, one of the nation's biggest airlines, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), saw its stock fall by as much as 48% over the last twelve months, while the S&P 500 gained 20%.  What's more, pundits are now saying that global air travel may not recover until 2024. However, one key reason may cause the sector to regain its passenger volume much sooner than expected, and American Airlines could be among the best placed to benefit from an industry-wide rebound. Let us take a look. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. During the height of the pandemic in April, when fatality rates were at their highest, American Airlines' fleet operated with as little as 15% capacity, and generated just $0.018 in revenue per available seat mile (RASM). Fortunately, that was the nadir of the company's operations. American Airlines' cash burn has since narrowed from $100 million per day in April, to $56 million per day through May, to $30 million per day in June. Simultaneously, the company's commercial capacity improved to 45% and 64% in May and June, respectively. With decreasing infection rates in the U.S. as of August 30, states may probably decide to lift lockdown measures for good and accelerate reopening the economy, further boosting consumers' confidence in air travel. Moreover, recent data indicates that there have been few to no cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmitting onboard aircraft, primarily due to airliners' efforts to screen passengers before boarding, enforce mask rules, and install robust air filtration systems. With the help of biotech companies, immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may be just around the corner. There are currently nine coronavirus vaccines undergoing Phase-3 efficacy tests in large-scale clinical trials. Preliminary results suggest they produced strong immune responses in smaller population groups. A vaccine for the coronavirus may enter regulatory review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as early as October.  If successful, companies researching a coronavirus vaccine will have a combined manufacturing capacity of billions of doses by the end of next year. Rest assured, the vaccine will be universally accessible pending approval. For example, large-cap pharmaceutical company Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is pricing its vaccine candidate at just $19.50 per dose, or $39 for one immunization treatment course. During the second quarter of 2020, American Airlines secured a $4.75 billion loan","Sep 2, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/02/buy-alert-american-airlines-stock-is-headed-higher/
6,Why DAL Stock Is the Strongest Airline Name at This Point | InvestorPlace,"Why Delta Is the Strongest Airline. DAL stock could rally in the near-term, but it remains risky. Capacity Restrictions Hurt"," Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK) recent 13F filing showed that it had sold all of its airline stocks. Warren Buffett had already promised Berkshire would sell its shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). So, when DAL stock fell modestly last week, markets did not think that Berkshire’s news was to blame. But with Delta’s stock now climbing and well off its 52-week lows, investors should buy the shares over those of other airlines. On Aug. 20, Delta said it would continue blocking the middle seats on its flights into January 2021. Although the limited capacity will weigh on the company’s revenue, it’s making the right move. Delta Chief Customer Experience Officer Bill Lentsch said, “We believe that taking care of our customers and employees and restoring confidence in the safety of air travel is more important right now than filling up every seat on a plane.” Delta’s actions should improve its image among the public. Customers who are already hesitant to fly will choose this airline over those who don’t leave their middle seats open. But the demand for flights is still weak. For the week that ended on Aug. 20, the number of travelers who entered America’s airport was down week-over-week, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Looking ahead, Delta will increasethe number of flights on its international routes  in late 2019 and next year. Although it is too early to know for sure, the easing or elimination of the Covid-19 pandemic could justify the higher number of flights. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE But first, countries need to open their borders. Until that happens, the airline’s international traffic will not rise much. Compared to its peers, Delta has more cash on hand and less debt. Data courtesy of Stock Rover Cash burn remains a problem for all airlines. Still, by urging its 3,000 flight attendants to take unpaid leave, Delta cut its operating costs. Since it expects to have more flight attendants than needed in 2021, the airline needed to address the over-staffing issue now. In March, the airline’s executives took a 50% pay cut. So the flight attendants will not be the only ones making a sacrifice. Simplywall.st has a price target of $65 on Delta’s stock. Wall Street analysts have an average price target of $38.86 on the shares, according to Tipranks. Those are","Sep 1, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/09/why-delta-is-the-strongest-airline/

8,Which aviation stocks are tipped for recovery? - interactive investor,Which aviation stocks are tipped for recovery?,"Share on: Despite the UK’s quarantine list growing, one bank has picked three airlines it thinks can soar back to health. Frequent changes to the UK's quarantine list have not deterred one City bank from backing Ryanair (LSE:RYA), easyJet (LSE:EZJ) and BA owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG) as stocks to play an aviation recovery. Today's note from UBS on Europe's airlines and airports sector highlights “some share price green shoots” after the battering seen since Covid-19 travel restrictions were imposed. Its analysis forecasts a reduction in long-haul capacity across this year of 50%, but with the fourth quarter likely to be some 24% lower as demand hopefully improves. For short-haul flights, capacity in the peak summer quarter is likely to be down 50% before an improvement to 12% in the forthcoming quarter. The bank, which hosts its 25th annual transport conference next week, has ‘buy’ recommendations on IAG, Ryanair and easyJet, with price targets of 290p, 1,170p and €13.50 (£11.9) respectively. Germany's Lufthansa is rated as a ‘sell’ by the bank. The note said: “While the sector year-to-date has seen material share price pressure, we could see some share price green shoots (albeit slow) as network recovery takes place and investors pivot portfolios into 2021.” The potential for an aviation sector recovery was downplayed yesterday by counterparts at JP Morgan, with the Wall Street bank cutting its rating on IAG to ‘neutral’ due to the carrier's long-haul exposure, particularly in riskier Covid-19 locations in the Americas. Its analyst David Perry warned: “As we enter autumn we are tactically cautious on all airlines as we expect fading leisure traffic and only anaemic business traffic."" Uncertainty over the UK's quarantine list has continued, with travellers arriving from Greece having to self-isolate for 14 days in Scotland but not those returning to England. A recently-established travel corridor between Portugal and UK is also in doubt after a rise in cases in the popular tourist destination. France, Spain and Switzerland are among other countries already on the UK's quarantine list. Low-cost carrier Ryanair disclosed today that it carried seven million passengers in August, compared with almost 15 million for the same month a year earlier. It has operated at about 60% of its normal August schedule, with a 73% load factor.

9,"United Cuts Profits, Spells Doom for Airline Stocks — One Way to Play It","United Cuts Profits, Spells Doom for Airline Stocks — One Way to Play It. One Way to Profit off Struggling"," Home » Chart of the Day » United Cuts Profits, Spells Doom for Airline Stocks — One Way to Play It  Posted by Michael Carr | Sep 2, 2020 | Chart of the Day 2 minute, 18 second read Last year, airline stock United Airlines Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: UAL
) earned $3 billion. Fees for baggage, seats with leg room and changing flights (which are all close to 100% profit) equaled 80% of that amount. But United recently cancelled all flight change fees. And that should set off alarms for anyone investing in airline stocks. The standard change fee, charged to passengers when switching reservations, was $200. Last year, passengers paid United $625 million to change flights. United is the first major carrier to give up fee income. That might offer a competitive advantage. Investors must now ask: How does sacrificing profits improve a business? Of course, it doesn’t. United is responding to the new reality for airlines. The chart below shows the load factor (aka how full the planes are) fell from 84.3% in December to 17.8% in April. Planes Aren’t Full Right Now Source: Federal Reserve Load factor is the percentage of passengers to the number of seats. For comparison, the low in the last recession was 72.2%. Airlines responded to load factors below 80% by cutting the number of planes they flew. Fleet reduction, and more fees, led to profits. United knows it needs to fill seats. Offering flexibility to passengers might help. If United thought it would enjoy a V-shaped recovery in travel, it wouldn’t cut fees. This announcement confirms it: The airline industry faces a challenge that requires reorganization.  This wouldn’t be the first time that airlines reorganized. United and US Air went bankrupt in 2002. Seven regional airlines followed suit in 2008. Only Frontier emerged from the process. For investors, it’s time to start planning for inevitable changes in the industry. Put options on individual airline stocks is one way to trade a downward move. United must be in bad shape to take the lead on change. Put options on U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSE: JETS
) are another way to trade the problems in the industry. It’s important to remember that United didn’t give up $600 million in revenue to help passengers.  United did it because the company faces a crisis. Investors should make decisions based on this looming crisis.

September 2, 2020  As you may know by now, stocks just had their best August in more than 30 years. The S&P 500 Index gained 7 percent, the most for the eighth calendar month since 1986, around the same time that Gordon Gekko raided corporations in Oliver Stone’s Wall Street. This is highly positive, as it means investors are betting that a possible vaccine for the coronavirus could be made available sooner rather than later. The head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Stephen Hahn, said on Sunday he is willing to authorize a vaccine before Phase Three clinical trials were complete. Tech stocks have been responsible for much of the market’s gains this year, but August saw a new crop of big gainers. Travel stocks—including airlines, cruise lines and hotels—were among the best performing equities during the month as new daily COVID-19 cases have declined in the U.S. from their mid-July highs. The NYSE Arca Airline Index rose an incredible 17.20 percent, its biggest one-month gain since January 2012. click to enlarge Royal Caribbean was the top performer of the bunch at 41 percent, followed by MGM Resorts at 40 percent and Norwegian at 25 percent—all representing industries that have been hardest hit by the pandemic.  The five biggest airlines in the U.S.—Delta, Southwest, American, United and Alaska—saw double-digit growth in August, even as federal aid is soon to run out. However, President Donald Trump said recently that he supports additional assistance to protect airline workers. “We’ll be helping the airlines. You have to help the airlines,” Trump said from the White House Tuesday. What that help might look like is unclear at the moment, but Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows claimed last week that Trump is considering an executive order to bypass Congressional lawmakers, which have still not agreed on a second major coronavirus relief package.

CNBC Newsletters","Take a look at some of the biggest movers in the premarket: Zoom Video (ZM) – Zoom reported quarterly profit of 92 cents per share, more than doubling the 45 cents a share consensus estimate. Revenue came in well above Street forecasts. Zoom also raised its annual revenue forecast by more than 30%, with the use of its video conferencing technology soaring as more workers and students operate remotely. Walmart (WMT) – Walmart will launch its membership program Walmart+ on Sept. 15. The service – which will compete with Amazon’s (AMZN) popular Prime program – will cost $98 per year, compared to $119 for Prime. The new program will also offer discounted gasoline. Walmart+ members will need to meet a $35 minimum online order size to receive free shipping. Tesla (TSLA) – The automaker plans to raise up to $5 billion through a stock offering, with banks selling shares from time to time based on the automaker’s instructions. American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) – These and other airline stocks remain on watch, after falling yesterday on United’s announcement that it was eliminating ticket change fees. Delta and American followed later in the day with similar announcements, and analysts say most competitors will be forced to follow the move amid the slump in travel demand. Schlumberger (SLB) – The oilfield services company will merge its North American fracking business with Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT), and will hold a 37% stake in the newly combined company. The deal comes amid a significant drop in oilfield services activity amid the pandemic and slumping energy consumption. Sanofi (SNY) – The French drugmaker said its rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara did not prove effective against Covid-19, with the treatment failing to significantly shorten hospital stays for patients in a 420-person study.

Forget IAG and easyJet,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Edward Sheldon, CFA | Tuesday, 1st September, 2020 | More on: EZJ IAG Airline stocks such as IAG (LSE: IAG) and easyJet (LSE: EZJ) are getting a lot of attention from investors right now. It’s not hard to see why. Year to date, IAG’s share price is down about 67%. Meanwhile, easyJet’s share price is down about 56%. These big share price falls are attracting value hunters. Personally, I’m not convinced that now is a great time to be buying IAG or EZJ shares. Here, I’ll explain why I’m leaving these stocks alone right now. I’ll also highlight the shares I’m buying instead. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... The first reason I’m avoiding the airlines right now is the high level of uncertainty related to Covid-19. We don’t know how long the coronavirus will hang around for. We also don’t know how long quarantines and closed borders will be in place. Add in the fact that governments around the world are constantly changing travel rules and it makes it very hard to make an informed investment decision about airline stocks right now. Ultimately, any recovery in the sector is likely to be slow and drawn out. The industry group IATA believes that travel will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. This adds risk to the investment cases for IAG and easyJet shares. A near-term rebound is not guaranteed.  Secondly, there’s uncertainty as to whether business travel will ever look the same post-Covid-19. Will companies continue to send their employees overseas for a short meeting? Or will they opt to run meetings via Zoom instead and save thousands? Don’t forget about sustainability. Nearly all companies these days are looking to reduce their carbon footprints. “I think business travel will never go back to what it was before, when people easily said, ‘I’m going to meet with somebody,’ got on a plane, and did that, without thinking through what the actual meeting was,” said Susan Liechtenstein, managing","Sep 1, 2020",https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2020/09/01/forget-iag-and-easyjet-shares-id-buy-these-stocks-instead/

Warren Buffett’s rule,"      Puja Tayal | September 2, 2020 | More on: ENB ENB Warren Buffett just turned 90 last month. He is the most decorated value investor, with more than 75 years in the investing world. Over the last few months, the stock market has been rallying even though the gross domestic product (GDP) contracted. If we go by the Buffet indicator, which is calculated by dividing market capitalization with GDP, the equities are overvalued by 80%. Does this mean another stock market crash is inevitable? Not necessarily, because the stock market is rising on the back of technology stocks that have high profits, and they earn a major portion of their revenue overseas. The pandemic has created a great opportunity for tech stocks. But I would not rule out the possibility of another market crash. Now, it is difficult to time a market crash as it happens when it is least expected. In the last few months, Warren Buffett made some interesting investments that abide by his two rules, “’Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No.1.” You can do two things that Buffett is doing to never lose money even in a market crash. In the last few months, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway made some surprising moves. Among them were exiting its position in airline stocks and Goldman Sachs, and lowering stakes in big banks such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. This doesn’t mean banks are a bad investment, because Berkshire Hathaway still has some of its top holdings in bank stocks. It even increased its stake in Bank of America by $340 million. The above sales show that Buffett is exiting stocks where he sees multiple years of losses. The Big Six Canadian Banks have reported $9.07 billion in provision for losses. They are exposed to huge credit defaults when the government aid and loan deferral programs end. Hence, many bank stocks failed to recover from the March sell-off. However, like Bank of America, Royal Bank of Canada is in a better position than other banks. Its stock has even recovered to the pre-pandemic level after falling 40% in March. As for airlines, Air Canada has already reported $2.8 billion in a net loss in the first half, vanishing almost 80% of its last three years’ combined profit of $3.55 billion. The airline would take at least seven years","Sep 2, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/09/02/2-things-buffett-is-doing-to-avoid-losing-money/
