2,American Airlines Stock: Should Investors Buy It Now?,American Airlines Stock: Should Investors Buy It Now?. Analysts changed stance on AAL stock. Ongoing troubles with American Airlines. What’s,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO American Airlines (AAL) stock has fallen significantly this year so far. The stock has lost nearly 12% or approximately $1.9 billion in market capitalization YTD (year-to-date). At yesterday’s closing price of $28.30, American Airlines stock currently trades near its five-year low of $24.23, which it reached on August 28. AAL stock is down 52% from its five-year high of $59.08 attained on January 16, 2018. It is also down nearly 36% from the 52-week high of $43.89 reached on September 21, 2018. American Airlines stock has underperformed the broader US market, as well as the iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT). The Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes have risen 16.2% and 20%, respectively, YTD. The IYT, which invests in Dow Jones transportation stocks, has gained 14.8% YTD. American Airlines stock has lagged its top peers. Shares of United Airlines (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV) have gained 6.8%, 17.6%, and 18.5%, respectively, YTD. American Airlines has struggled to keep pace with its rivals this year. At the beginning of 2019, analysts were optimistic about American Airlines stock. However, its exposure to Boeing (BA) 737 MAX jets and the ongoing labor dispute with mechanics cast a shadow on its growth prospects. Estimating the risks, several Wall Street analysts either downgraded American Airlines stock or trimmed their target prices. In January, nearly 74% of the 19 analysts covering American Airlines stock have a bullish stance, and the remaining analysts recommend holding it. None of them have a bearish view on the stock. However, their perspective has changed following the 737 MAX grounding and uncertainty over its quick return to service. On September 19, two of the 20 analysts have turned bearish on American Airlines stock. Currently, 60% of 20 analysts are bullish, 30% have a neutral view, and the remaining 10% are bearish on the stock. Wall Street’s average target price of $44.94 in January has decreased 15% to $38.35. Notably, Boeing’s 737 MAX planes are facing a global flying ban since mid-March following two crashes within five months. American Airlines owns 24 MAX aircraft. Since mid-March, the airline has canceled over 10,000 flights due to the MAX grounding. In the second quarter alone, AAL canceled 7,800 MAX flights, which resulted in a 0.8% YoY decline in overall capacity. The company disclosed that the MAX grounding impacted its Q2 pretax income by $175 million. It","Sep 20, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/09/american-airlines-stock-should-investors-buy-it-now/
3,2 Under-the-Radar Growth Stocks | The Motley Fool,2 Under-the-Radar Growth Stocks. The aviation industry has been a hot sector in 2019. Here's a look at two stocks,"   In a volatile year for the stock market, one sector in the industrial world has been noteworthy for its consistency and ability to reward investors: aerospace. It has been the standout segment in the results of large industrial conglomerates like GE, Honeywell, and United Technologies even as growth has slowed in other industrial sectors such as automotive, semiconductors, and even food and beverage. As such, investors looking for smaller and more aerospace-focused companies won't be surprised to see that HEICO (NYSE:HEI) and Hexcel (NYSE:HXL) are up big in 2019. Let's look at both stocks to see whether their outperformance can continue, and which is the better buy.  The case for a long-term investment in the industry is based on the startling turnaround in airline profitability since the last recession. From being an industry that struggled to cover its cost of capital in previous decades, the worldwide commercial airline industry has significantly restructured and is now going through a period of unprecedented profitability -- best seen in the multiyear backlogs at Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. One of the big winners in this environment has been HEICO, a manufacturer of engine and aircraft components. HEICO helps airlines save money by making repairs and selling parts approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (the company claims to hold over 10,000 approvals). This is a big deal because airlines can source parts from a less costly alternative than the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). In addition, it's worth noting that the highly regulated nature of the industry means HEICO has a considerable industry moat around it. As a highly acquisitive company, HEICO has effectively been a geared play on the aviation industry in the last decade, and the result can be seen in the chart below.  CAE DATA BY YCHARTS. There's no doubt that HEICO is a very attractive business, but is it a great investment right now? Turning to the question of valuation, let's a look at its enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- a commonly used valuation metric.  Here is the problem: Not only is HEICO's absolute valuation looking high, it's relatively high compared with where it's been in the last decade. Moreover, on a forward valuation of 33 times EBITDA, it's going to take a while before the company grows into its","Sep 20, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/09/20/under-the-radar-growth-stocks.aspx

MORE IN TRADING","It’s been a big month for homebuilders. Home construction stocks — tracked by the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF, ticker ITB — have climbed nearly 9% in the last month, with names like KB Home and Toll Brothers notching double-digit gains. KB Home shares reached a 52-week high on Wednesday after U.S. housing starts, an indicator monitoring new homes that begin construction each month, hit a 12-year high in August. But even with the positive housing data and the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday — both of which are generally bullish for homebuilders — experts aren’t signing off on chasing the group. “We’re looking at a similar situation as we saw back in April,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation,” referencing a chart of the ITB. “Back then, I said, ‘Jeez, the group’s getting overbought on a near-term basis,’ and ... it’s actually a little bit more overbought than it was in April.”  While “there’s no question” that the 12-year U.S. homebuilding level is positive for the construction stocks, “this is a group that’s getting a little bit ahead of itself,” Maley said. “Unless you’re a very short-term trader, I wouldn’t take profits,” he said. “Rather than chase the group here, ... I think you look for pullbacks; you’ll do a little bit better. But there’s no question those housing starts data should help the group.” Micahel Bapis, managing director with Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management, said his wealth management team is pulling back somewhat the sector. “We think that the sector’s taking a breather,” Bapis said in the same “Trading Nation” interview on Wednesday, noting that many of the housing stocks have doubled in price in the last six to 12 months. “We’re not panicking and selling the whole group” despite muted forward-earnings estimates, Bapis said. “Given the interest rate environment, you may see housing starts continue to rise and you may see the sector continue to perform, but we’re ... stepping away from it a little bit.” Part of that strategy comes from looking under the hood at the business of housing itself, he said. “Our research analysts have said that a lot of the high-end construction projects and homes are starting to slow down, and that’s kind of an indicator to us that people are waiting and seeing how this","Sep 19, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/19/housing-starts-hit-12-year-high-but-underlying-stocks-may-lose-steam.html

s they set national policy on important issues such as climate change, tech monopolies, medical debt and income inequality, US senators have glaring conflicts of interest, an investigation by news website Sludge and the Guardian can reveal. An analysis of personal financial disclosure data as of 16 August has found that 51 senators and their spouses have as much as $96m personally invested in corporate stocks in five key sectors: communications/electronics; defense; energy and natural resources; finance, insurance and real estate; and health. The majority of these stocks come from public companies, and some are private. Overall, the senators are invested in 338 companies – including tech firms such as Apple and Microsoft, oil and gas giants including ExxonMobil and Antero Midstream, telecom companies including Verizon, and major defense contractors such as Boeing – in the five sectors as categorized by Sludge. Congressional financial disclosures present investments in dollar ranges, not exact amounts, so all data in this report comes in ranges, some very wide. The median stock investment range in the five sectors for the 51 senators is between $100,000 and $365,000, while the average range of the investments is between $551,000 and nearly $1,874,000. Not only are the senators far wealthier than most of their constituents, but they’re in a prime position to increase their wealth via policymaking. It’s not illegal for members of Congress to have personal financial stakes in the industries on which they legislate. But such investments raise questions about lawmakers’ motivations. If a representative on the House financial services committee owns hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in Bank of America, how might this investment affect their questioning of Bank of America’s CEO in a hearing? Could it influence how they legislate and vote on banking issues? While some members of Congress do try to limit possible conflicts of interest others claim their personal finances could never influence their conduct as elected representatives of the people, or fail to acknowledge concerns about their finances. Senator Joe Manchin, the ranking member on the Senate energy and natural resources committee, owns between $1m and $5m worth of non-public stock in his family coal business, Enersystems, making him the","Sep 19, 2019",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/19/us-senators-investments-conflict-of-interest

11,Half of Ryanair shareholders vote against Michael O’Leary’s 10m stock options,Half of Ryanair shareholders vote against Michael O’Leary’s 10m stock options. Bonus scheme that could earn Ryanair chief executive €100m,"   Michael O’Leary argued that the deal was a “free bet” for shareholders as he would get nothing if he failed to double both the share price and profits. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Shareholders challenged the grant of 10 million stock options to Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, at the airline’s annual general meeting on Thursday. A vote on the company’s remuneration report, which signals shareholders’ approval of executive pay and bonuses, passed with only a narrow 50.5 per cent majority at the meeting. Jocelyn Brown, senior investment manager with British rail workers’ retirement fund, RPMI Railpen, a Ryanair investor, questioned why the airline agreed to grant chief Mr O’Leary 10 million share options if the stock price and profits double over the next five years. Mr O’Leary signed a new five-year contract with Ryanair in April, which halved both his salary and bonus to €500,000 each, but pledged to give him 10 million share options if he met the performance targets. Speaking after the meeting, Mr O’Leary argued that the deal was a “free bet” for shareholders as he would get nothing if he failed to double both the share price and profits. “You can understand why certain shareholders think that’s far too generous, but I think most shareholders would take the view, if he doubles the share price in the next five years, we almost don’t care what you pay him,” he added. Mr O’Leary, who owns 3.9 per cent of Ryanair, said that the airline had agreed in talks with shareholders to drop share options in future in favour of a long-term incentive plan, a bonus scheme used by most quoted companies to pay and retain executives. He pointed out that non-executive directors would also get some benefits under this scheme. Responding to Ms Brown’s questions at the meeting, Ryanair non-executive director and remuneration committee chairman, Howard Millar, argued that signing up Mr O’Leary’s services for a further five years was very important to the company. He explained that the board had calculated that the deal with Mr O’Leary would cost Ryanair €1.6 million a year, significantly below what comparable businesses pay their executives. Mr Millar stressed that the shares would only be given to Mr O’Leary if Ryanair’s stock price doubled. “The board very strongly believes that it is in the best interests of the company,” he said.

Dismiss 20 Sep 2019 // Star Feature // 2 Comments »  Frontier Airlines has had a turbulent past.  As a full-service hub airline, it suffered from poor financial performance that resulted in bankruptcy protection.  Following its 2013 acquisition by Indigo Partners, the airline’s strategic about-face – turning it into an ultra-low-cost-carrier – began.   2015 was a pivotal year in its ULCC transformation from which its new strategy and cost mindset became clear. This involved fast growth mainly away from its Denver hub; higher-capacity aircraft; leisure locations; greater seasonality (yield-LF balance); and a big focus on overpriced, underserved and, in particular, unserved routes.  Its aim: lower costs; higher LFs; higher productivity; more ancillaries from greater traffic volume; and better performance. Between 2015 and 2019, Frontier almost doubled in size by carrying 12.7 million additional passengers, for a CAGR of 13%.  Last month, Frontier announced a major foray into NYC, with 15 new routes from Newark.  This followed Southwest’s announced pulldown at Newark in favour of La Guardia, and it allows Frontier to enhance its small NYC position.  This highlights the airline’s approach to new routes: an assorted collection – across major, mid-sized and smaller cities throughout the country – but ordinarily with a very strong VFR/holiday focus.   Its ‘here, there and everywhere’ approach makes it difficult for competitors to predict its new routes, which is how it should be.  However, it leads to people talking of a ‘dartboard approach’, aided by its intolerance to inadequate performance – but this is crucial for a primarily P2P-focused LCC/ULCC.  In spring 2018, Frontier announced that nine further routes would start from San Antonio, including Albuquerque, Charlotte and Memphis, all two-to-four-weekly.  Less than a year later, all nine had been cut. The data seemed compelling across all nine.  The Consumer Airfare Report shows that, in 2017, San Antonio-Omaha had 35,000 passengers flying indirectly with","Sep 20, 2019",https://www.anna.aero/2019/09/20/to-new-lands-the-development-of-frontier-airlines/

Financial creditors, including domestic and foreign banks, have dues worth over Rs 8,200 crore with Jet Airways. The total claims amount has risen even as the Synergy Group, the sole suitor for the beleaguered Jet Airways, met with lenders of the airline earlier this week seeking a haircut on its existing debt. On June 24, the RP had invited operational and financial creditors to file claims against the airline. Claims worth Rs 13,670 crore have so far been rejected, according to data on the airline’s website. Jet Airways has been grounded for five months. It halted operations on April 17, after lenders refused to provide emergency funding to the airline. Slots belonging to Jet Airways have since been reallocated to other airlines. Following the grounding of Jet Airways, lenders of the airline, led by the State Bank of India, tried in vain to sell the airline. On June 20, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) initiated insolvency proceedings against the airline. According to the timeline set out by the RP, the resolution plan for Jet Airways is expected to be finalised for the NCLT’s approval by October 27.

The government, however, has serious concerns on whether the investment","By Anwesha Ganguly The Synergy Group, the sole suitor for Jet Airways, met with government officials on Wednesday to discuss the revival of the grounded airline. The group, promoted by Bolivian-born German Efromovich, sought assurance from the government on recovery of Jet’s slots. The government sought clarity whether the group’s business proposal was compliant with Indian foreign direct investment (FDI) rules, sources said. “Officials from the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA ) met with the group’s representatives on Wednesday. The Synergy Group mainly sought assurance on the return of Jet’s slots. In response, the government gave an assurance that reallocating the slots should not be an issue post March,” a person aware of the developments told FE. The Synergy Group will also send a technical team to evaluate Jet’s assets, sources indicated to FE. The slots of Jet Airways, which has been grounded for the past five months, have been reallocated to other airlines till March 2020. The government, however, has serious concerns on whether the investment from the Synergy Group will comply with Indian FDI rules, as the group is yet to find an Indian partner. As per the Indian FDI regulations, a foreign airline can directly invest up to 49% in a scheduled Indian carrier. However, the rule applies only to those entities which directly own an airline. If the foreign entity is an investment arm, private equity, fund, bank, or an industry conglomerate, FDI can go up to 74%, which is the maximum permissible investment that can be held by a foreign investor provided it is explicitly not an airline. “The Synergy Group has informed the government that it is looking for Indian partners and their legal team is looking for ways to resolve the concerns regarding FDI,” the source said. Last week, FE reported that the resolution professional (RP) for Jet Airways has approached at least two Indian companies to partner with the Synergy Group to invest in the grounded airline. Independently, Synergy Group has also held talks with some Indian entities.
The Synergy group has also met lenders of Jet Airways including State Bank of India, IDBI Bank and Yes Bank this week. The group gave presentations to the lenders on their potential business plans with the airline. An adviser to the group had last month told FE that the group wants lenders to take a significant haircut.
