2,"Even After the Recent Sell-Off, You Should Still Avoid These Airline Stocks Right Now | The Motley Fool","Even After the Recent Sell-Off, You Should Still Avoid These Airline Stocks Right Now. Airline stocks have plunged over the","   The rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the airline industry over the past month. In recent weeks, the leaders of virtually every major U.S. airline have warned that booking activity has plunged to negligible levels. Some airlines are projecting revenue declines of 80% or more for the second quarter. This has sent airline CFOs scrambling to line up new sources of liquidity and forced airlines to implement unprecedented near-term capacity cuts. Not surprisingly, airline stocks have plunged because of this crisis. Shares of global airline giants American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) have been among the big losers. On a year-to-date basis, they have fallen 64% and 73%, respectively. Nearly all of those declines have come in the past month.  AMERICAN AIRLINES AND UNITED AIRLINES STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. However, while some airline stocks could be worth buying due to this steep sell-off, American Airlines and United Airlines don't fit the bill. Both companies entered 2020 with too much debt, making them ill-equipped to absorb the losses they are likely to incur this year -- even with government assistance. Furthermore, it could take a long time for their profitability to recover from this sharp downturn. In recent years, American Airlines has maintained the dubious distinction of being the most-indebted airline in the U.S. This came as a result of management's ill-conceived strategy of spending heavily on capex and share buybacks simultaneously. At the end of 2019, American had a stunning $33.4 billion of debt and lease liabilities, offset by just $3.8 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. That put its net debt at more than four times the company's 2019 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent. United Airlines has a significantly better balance sheet, but it still has a little too much debt for comfort. It reported debt and lease liabilities of $20.5 billion at the end of 2019, offset by $4.9 billion of cash and investments. These heavy debt burdens are problematic because airlines will have to take on additional debt to get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry lobbying group Airlines for America has been requesting a mixture of grants (or payroll assistance) and loans to help airlines navigate the current crisis, but so far politicians haven't been willing to go beyond loans or loan guarantees.

4,Major airline stocks are surging on hopes that a coronavirus relief package is coming soon | Markets Insider,. Major airline stocks are surging on hopes that a coronavirus relief package is coming soon. SHARE THIS POST. Your,"   Scott Olson / Getty Images  Airline stocks are skyrocketing on the hopes that a coronavirus relief package will soon be approved, giving aid to industries hit hardest by the impact of the outbreak.  Shares of United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines all posted double-digit gains Tuesday, reversing earlier losses driven by the coronavirus pandemic. As the virus and cases of COVID-19, the illness it causes, have spread, the airline industry has been decimated as companies and governments cease non-essential travel and consumers cancel trips to practice social distancing.  Here's how much each stock has gained at 10:50 a.m. in New York, in order of biggest gain:   Read more: As energy experts come to grips with the 'black swan' coronavirus and plunging oil, 4 of them share their outlook for the struggling industry — and assess the economic fallout As coronavirus-induced panic has gripped markets and dampened consumer confidence, airline stocks have taken a huge hit. The big-four US airlines have shed as much as 50% of their market values in recent weeks as travel has ground to a near-halt.  About a week ago, Airlines for America — a trade group made up of airlines including United, American, and Delta — asked for a roughly $54 billion bailout from the government to help shield the carriers as the coronavirus crisis continues. Still, the industry has faced criticism from experts and government officials. In the last decade, the major airlines have used 96% of cash flows on stock buybacks to prop up share prices and return value to shareholders, according to Bloomberg. Under the latest bailout proposal from the House of Representatives, airlines will be prohibited from buying back stock or issuing dividends if they accept government funds. The bill, introduced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as a counter to the GOP's Senate bill, still calls for significant relief for airlines and their employees.   On Tuesday, Pelosi said on a call with CNBC that there is ""real optimism"" that a deal could soon be reached on the coronavirus stimulus package and that it could come in the next few hours.

5,Will American Airlines (AAL) Stock Fall More Than 50% to $5? | InvestorPlace,Will American Airlines Stock Fall More Than 50% to $5?. AAL stock faces grave risks and infinite unknowns as the," Airline stocks have been hammered, which is no surprise under the circumstances. The coronavirus from China dealt a painful blow to the stock market, and the airlines industry in particular. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) hasn’t been an exception to that pain, with AAL stock down about 50% this month. However, some analysts believe even more pain could be in store. Analysts at Bank of America slapped a $5 price target on American Airlines on Monday morning. After closing north of $10 on Friday, that implies more than 50% downside in the stock price. Keep in mind, AAL stock has already fallen roughly 60% from its one-year high. That’s better than the 70% tumble in United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL). However, it trails Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which is down 38% from its one-year high. On the one hand, it’s hard to imagine the federal government letting the airline industry go belly up. That includes suppliers like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and General Electric (NYSE:GE), too. There are simply too many jobs on the line and air travel is a major piece of domestic and international logistics. That being said, Congress has yet to pass any financial relief along to the industry, even though it’s under incredible financial strain. However, there’s a certain amount of disdain toward the industry. People are frustrated that airlines have spent billions of dollars in shares buybacks and are now requesting what is essentially a bailout. Some reports have said 96% of the industry’s free cash flow has gone toward corporate buybacks, helping to inflate earnings per share instead of building up a war chest of capital in the event of tough times. Others say Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) should bail them out. Berkshire is one of the largest shareholders in the industry and is flush with cash. The whole thing has left investors and observers torn on whether the industry — which now appears careless at best and selfish at worst — really deserves a bailout. The flip side of that is, was it really irresponsible to buy back stock? No one was predicting that the global economy would slam on the brakes due to a worldwide pandemic. The companies have already signaled to Congress that layoffs are around the corner without aid. That’s no surprise, with Delta Air Lines’ (NYSE:DAL) management saying it’s burning through about $350 million a week at the moment. All we know now","Mar 24, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/03/will-american-airlines-stock-fall-more-than-50-to-5/
6,UAL Stock: Is Now the Time to Buy United Airlines? | InvestorPlace,Is Now the Time to Buy United Airlines Stock?. You might want to wait for a bailout package to pass," What a difference a few months can make. Three months ago, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) was flying high. At the start of December, UAL stock was trading near the $92 level, just $5 off its all-time record highs. Then the coronavirus from China struck. With global travel and tourism hammered, airlines are being hit worse than most companies. UAL plunged. Last week, it closed as low as $21.28 — a 77% drop from the start of December.    With its stock at levels not seen in a decade, is this a buying opportunity — a chance to scoop up United Airlines at bargain bin prices?  Airlines in general are hurting, and United is no exception. Last Friday, United sent an email to employees warning that without financial assistance, it would be forced to undertake mass layoffs by the end of March. The plummet in share prices across the industry tell the story of how desperate the current situation is for airlines. Since mid-February, the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index has fallen 61%. Since the first market crash on Feb. 20, UAL shares have dropped 69%. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has lost 64%. Delta (NYSE:DAL) is down 63%. With coronavirus travel restrictions in place, international flights by U.S. airlines have all but halted. Domestic schedules are also beginning to be cut. Unfortunately for United, bailing out airlines is a touchy subject. Flyers have been enduring belt-tightening measures for years, including shrinking seats, reduced leg room and increasing fees. Meanwhile, rather than improve service, airlines have been pouring their cash into share buyback programs that benefit investors. This hasn’t endeared airlines to consumers, making politicians wary. The government introduced a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill last week. Despite the potential for political fallout over proving financial assistance to airlines, the bill contained $50 billion specifically earmarked for passenger airlines, and an additional $8 billion for cargo air companies. The bill failed to pass in the Senate over the weekend. That doesn’t mean it’s dead, but immediate relief for airlines isn’t coming and when it does, it may have strings attached. When the coronavirus pandemic is under control, which could be months or longer, airlines will face another challenge. The economic damage inflicted is likely to result in a recession. In tough times, people don’t indulge in luxuries like vacations. Businesses cut down on trips. Air travel takes a hit.

More Resources for the Stocks in,"  DAL – It is hard to overlook the long term value of these leading airline stocks: DAL, UAL, and LUV. Even if now is not bottom…its still plenty of attractive for long term investors. Mar 24, 2020  What I am about to say is not a shock to anyone. And that is to say that airlines have been devastated by the global rise of the Coronavirus. As such many have seen shares dive 60-80% from in the past month. Is now the time to buy the dip in airlines like DAL, UAL and LUV? Many investors think so today as this group is leading the market higher. Helping their cause is the strong belief that the Government stimulus package will help the industry given how integral it is to the economy. 9 ""MUST OWN"" Growth Stocks For 2021 I’ll be honest. I am not sure if today marks the true resurrection of the group. Or if we need to find lower lows before a lasting bounce occurs. But what I do know, is that when the next bull market emerges, that all investors should overweight these airline stocks given the supreme likelihood of an oversized bounce from bottom. So read up on the merits of each of these leading airlines below so you can have them on your radar screen for the right time to buy for the long flight back to higher prices. Delta Air Lines (DAL)  DAL enjoys the distinction of being the largest passenger airline in the world. DAL shareholders have certainly enjoyed the fruits of the labor with shares on a steady ascent over the last several years. Plus the company pays a robust dividend that has actually quadrupled since 2014. In fact, I have been in and out of DAL shares over the years in the Reitmeister Total Return portfolio as I think it’s the class of the industry. Meaning that as Peter Lynch and Cramer recommend, if you go for a group, then you should go for the industry leader. And when it comes to the airlines, that is Delta. DAL is rebounding big time this morning as I write this article. But again, it is a loooonnnnggg way off the 52 week high of $63.44. It may take 2-3 years to get back there again.

American Airlines, like most other airline stocks, has been hit hard by the sharp drop in air-travel demand due to the coronavirus outbreak,which eventually dented its stock’s prospects. Coronavirus-Led Woes Stunt American Airlines’ Growth Due to the coronavirus-induced steep plunge in demand, American Airlines aims to cut international flights by 75% and domestic flights by 30% in April. In response to the extremely low-demand scenario, this Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) Fort Worth, TX-based carrier suspended all its long-haul international flightsapart from the ones flyingto London Heathrow and Tokyo. The carrier trimmedits April schedule by more than 55,000 flights and decided to park approximately 130 widebody and 320 narrowbody planes. Further reductions are planned for May. With revenues being hurt due to extremely low passenger traffic, American Airlines is looking to cut costs to drive the bottom line. Evidently, the carrier halted its hiring process apart from offering pay-freeze options.  Moreover, the carrier decided to temporarily discontinue itsnew hire flight attendant classes. In view of the massive slump in passenger revenues due to weak demand, it is natural that American Airlines’ financial position is being stressed. To bolster its liquidity position, the carrier recently secured a $1-billion loan. As a result, it currently has $8.4 billion of total available cash in hand.

Getting a handle,"Getty Images Getting a handle on the stock market's direction is becoming increasingly difficult as volatility has ratcheted up and daily moves of 5% or more have become commonplace. The S&P 500 has already lost a third of its of its value from its Feb. 19, 2020, peak, and some (though not all) analysts see even lower prices ahead. Economists and market strategists are predicting that the 2020 bear market could descend as low as 60% losses as the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak begins to look very, very real. Small business owners are being forced to close up shop en masse. Many U.S. manufacturers, including the ""Big Three"" automakers, have halted production at their North American facilities. Airlines, cruise operators and hotel owners have seen their businesses rapidly dry up. Crude oil prices are in a deep bear market. Meanwhile, European and U.S. stimulus packages designed to back businesses and consumers alike have barely moved the needle. But those governments – and many more across the world – still are preparing even more measures to throw at the coronavirus effort. So where does the stock market go from here?

""Our new 2020 EPS (earnings per share) forecast of $138, -15% YoY, has the same quarterly arc as our team's U.S. GDP views, with trough growth in 2Q and a recovery in the second half assuming virus containment by the end of 2H. But given the fluid nature of this crisis, we will refresh our views in our 1Q preview, and regularly thereafter.""

McCombie | Monday, 23rd March, 2020 | More on: WIZZ According to data from FlightRadar, global commercial air traffic has slumped. As the coronavirus spreads across the globe, more flights will be grounded, either because of consumer choice or orders from governments. Faced with losing lethal amounts of revenue, airline bosses have made pleas for aid, for their firms, but also the industry in general. Airlines would be good candidates for avoidance for short-term investors, given the immediate outlook for the industry. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential...

After sifting through the wreckage, I think Wizz Air (LSE: WIZZ) is worth salvaging. Wizz is a low-cost, pay-for-thrills airline, flying short-haul routes (2019 average of 1,635 km per flight) to and from central and eastern European (CEE) countries, where it is the market leader.

At the same time, Wizz has got better at matching capacity with demand. Load capacity, found by dividing seats sold by those available, has increased from 83.6% to 92.6%. Wizz has assembled a young (average age of planes is just over four years) and fuel-efficient (newer airframes and engines) fleet. Keeping operating costs down, and getting passengers to pay for add-ons has seen profits rise in each of the last four years. Things looked good for Wizz. CEE countries are growing GDP faster than other western markets, and Wizz was benefitting from the spillover into air travel demand. Then the coronavirus hit. In a trading update released today, Wizz announced that 85% of its fleet is grounded, and it has not ruled out the other 15% following suit. Wizz’s chief executive reiterated early pleas from airline bosses for government assistance for the","Mar 23, 2020",https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2020/03/23/this-ftse-stock-might-just-take-off-again-once-the-market-crash-is-over/
