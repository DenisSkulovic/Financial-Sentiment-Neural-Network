0,Airline Stocks: What’s Keeping Them From Taking Off?,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"                                 I fly all over the world, so I know all about the factors that can influence whether a flight is delayed or canceled. Weather tends to be the biggest offender, but now when taking a trip to or from Hong Kong, there’s an even bigger one. Source: Shutterstock This hasn’t been covered much by the U.S. media, but since June, 1.7 million protestors took to the streets of Hong Kong over proposed amendments to its extradition law. This law would allow someone in Hong Kong to face trial in mainland China. More recently, protestors took the fight from the streets to the air, so to speak. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips For about the last two weeks, the airline industry was put on hold when thousands of protesters gathered across Hong Kong’s international airport. This hindered the usual 1,100 daily flights to and from Hong Kong, and has been affecting top performing airlines, such as American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV). On August 12, for example, around 200 arriving and departing flights were cancelled. Protestors also took to warning away tourists and travelers who were already occupying the premises. And then, last Monday, nearly 150 departing flights were cancelled by airport authorities. Hong Kong has since suspended the extradition bill.  And, according to CNN, flights are to resume tomorrow. Hopefully, this is a sign that the Hong Kong protests will resolve without a military presence soon, but it is an event I will continue to watch very carefully to see how it unfolds. But the Hong Kong protests aren’t the only things hurting the airlines right now. Problems at The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) have been weighing on the sector, too. As you may recall, the company’s 737 MAX airplanes were grounded in the wake of two fatal crashes involving the aircraft. Since then, it has been determined that a software glitch was partly responsible for the two crashes.                         Marcus Mariota owes a ""thank you"" call to his agent.

1,"Trade War Escalated, Airline Stocks Fell","Trade War Escalated, Airline Stocks Fell. Escalating US-China trade war. Why the trade war?. Broader market fell","UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO US airline stocks fell drastically on August 23. The industry seems to be bearing the brunt of the escalating trade war and sluggish economic growth concerns. Although the global economic factors don’t have a direct impact on the airline industry, they have an impact in the long run. Shares of most US air carriers closed in the red on August 23. Notably, American Airlines (AAL) stock fell the most with a decline of 4.2%. United Airlines (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV) fell 3.5%, 3%, and 1.2%, respectively. The iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT) fell 3.3%. IYT invests in Dow Jones US transportation stocks. About 20% of IYT’s portfolio consists of passenger airline companies. Tense trade relations between the US and China could have a negative impact on airlines’ business traveler traffic in the long run. Also, weaker trade relations could trigger a recession in the global economy. A recession would have a negative impact on the job market. A soft job market means less disposable income, which leads people to cancel or postpone their vacation plans. Rising trade tensions between the US and China played a crucial role in the stock market plunge. On August 23, the two countries imposed hefty tariffs on billion dollars’ worth of each other imported goods. The first announcement came from Chinese officials on August 23, according to a CNBC report. China will levy 5%–10% duties on $75 billion worth of US goods. The tariffs will be imposed in two tranches effective on September 1 and December 15. China will also enforce a 25% tariff on US imported cars and 5% on auto parts and components effective on December 15. Soon after China’s announcement, President Trump retaliated with more tariffs. According to a New York Times report, President Trump announced additional tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to 30% from 25%. He also threatened to raise taxes from 10% to 15% on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. The taxes are supposed to start on September 1. On August 23, President Trump tweeted, “China should not have put new Tariffs on 75 BILLION DOLLARS of United States product (politically motivated!).” He also tweeted, “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.” Since he was elected in","Aug 26, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/08/trade-war-escalated-airline-stocks-fell/
2,Here's one way to play the auto stocks as trade tensions boil over,"This is an ‘interesting’ way to play auto stocks as trade tensions boil over, technician says. MORE IN TRADING NATION.","Auto stocks are caught in the crossfire of the trade war again. General Motors and Ford were slammed Friday, falling 3%, after China resumed a 25% tariff on U.S. autos beginning December. Any trade deal became even more distant after President Donald Trump tweeted that U.S. manufacturers should “immediately” look for alternatives to China. “There is too much uncertainty around the auto sector, especially in the U.S. to call any of these stocks a buy right now,” Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures, told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. GM, for example, would have to fall back to $32 to offer good value, he adds. GM would need to fall by 11% to get to that level.  Instead of directly investing in them, Baruch says he has an “interesting” way to gain exposure to the U.S. automakers. “Take a look at the ETF RXI — Toyota is the number three name in there, and then it’s surrounded by Amazon, McDonald’s and Home Depot, and that gives you a way to diversify without idiosyncratic risk,” said Baruch. The RXI global consumer discretionary ETF holds U.S. and international stocks in the sector — GM and Ford make up 2% of the fund. “That has a good support line coming in at $112, as the chart would show, and the 200-day moving average is there. So I think that’s a good place to look to get some exposure in autos,” said Baruch.  The RXI ETF is trading nearly 2% above the $112 level of support. Steve Chiavarone, portfolio at Federated Investors, says Chinese tariffs should not impact U.S. automakers in too detrimental a way. However, he does see one thing that is impeding operations. “When you think about the tariff issue here, you know [Friday’s] announcement is not a big deal. The bulk of their business is done in the United States,” Chiavarone said Friday. “The bigger deal might be what comes [next from the Trump administration], because they are importing a lot of goods — steel, aluminum. It’s the import tariffs that are really hurting this group, not so much the export tariffs into China.” Disclosure: Federated’s Global Allocation Fund owns Ford.

3,Analysts say buy these stocks if a recession hits,"Wall Street analysts say these stocks present a buying opportunity if the US enters a recession. Seaport - Matson, buy","Wall Street analysts say there’s plenty of value to be found if a downturn were to hit the economy. CNBC examined the most recent Wall Street research to find top picks by analysts in a recessionary environment. They include names such as Matson, Planet Fitness, TJX Cos., National Vision Holdings and AquaVenture Limited Holdings. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has repeatedly broken below the 2-year rate since Aug.14, an odd bond market phenomenon that historically preceded recessions. But analysts say that even if a recession were to happen, there’s a still wide range of options to bolster your portfolio. Planet Fitness recently reported earnings that were better than many expected and analysts at Jefferies continue to compare the company to Amazon, calling it “Amazonian.” The fitness center operator should benefit from its defensive qualities, they said. The firm called the company “recession resistant,” and added Planet Fitness would also benefit from its lack of China exposure. “The $10 price point makes it unlikely for people to cancel,” analyst Randal Konik told CNBC. The stock is down 3% over the last week. Retail is an area that analysts generally agree would be hurt by tariffs and an economic downturn as many of their goods are imported from China. But analysts at Wedbush consider what’s known as the “off-price” sector to generally be more resistant to economic instability. The “off-price” sector includes companies such as Ross Stores and T.J. Maxx. “We continue to look upon the off-price sector as an area of strength in markets troubled by tariff concerns with flexible business models resilient to cost passthroughs, and as e-commerce can’t replace the off-price experience of bargain hunting in stores,” they said. Shares of TJX are up over 3% over the last week. Another recession friendly stock is ocean freight shipper Matson, analysts at Seaport Global say. The company provides shipping services in the Pacific as well as to and from the Hawaiian Islands. Matson made a key acquisition three years ago of another shipper in Alaska, which has helped the company gain market share and revenue and in turn could help soften the blow in the event of an economic downturn. “We believe that the addition of Span Alaska gives the company some cushion to a downturn or recession that they did not have when they were part of Alexander and Baldwin during the great recession in 2008-2009,”","Aug 26, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/analysts-say-buy-these-stocks-if-a-recession-hits.html
4,Hawaiian Holdings Stock Approaches a Multiyear Low on Southwest Fears | The Motley Fool,Hawaiian Holdings Stock Approaches a Multiyear Low on Southwest Fears. Hawaiian Holdings' profit margin has contracted sharply over the past,"   Shares of Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) have been in a tailspin for more than two years due to investors' fears about rising competition on routes to and within Hawaii. United Airlines aggressively expanded its capacity to Hawaii beginning in late 2017, and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) began flying several mainland-Hawaii and interisland routes earlier this year. The surge in capacity on mainland-Hawaii routes -- and more recently, on interisland routes -- has hurt Hawaiian Airlines' profitability. With Southwest Airlines planning to resume its growth in Hawaii in early 2020, shares of Hawaii's hometown airline recently fell to a multiyear low near $23. Yet investors appear to be too pessimistic with respect to Hawaiian's ability to stabilize its earnings and return to growth in the years ahead. That makes Hawaiian Holdings an attractive turnaround stock to consider.  HAWAIIAN HOLDINGS STOCK PERFORMANCE. DATA BY YCHARTS. It's important to acknowledge that the recent uptick in competition has caused meaningful margin erosion for Hawaiian Airlines. In 2016 and 2017, the carrier's adjusted pre-tax margin was approximately 18%: a stellar result for any airline. However, Hawaiian's adjusted pre-tax margin fell to 12.6% last year and declined by more than 3 percentage points in the first half of 2019. Based on the company's current outlook, Hawaiian Airlines appears likely to face a similar amount of margin pressure in the second half of the year. That would put its full-year pre-tax margin between 9% and 10% -- respectable but far from extraordinary. Notably, Hawaiian's financial performance on international routes has been improving, due to a better supply demand balance there and the strength of the Japanese yen. All of the company's earnings pressure has come in the mainland-Hawaii and interisland markets. Earlier this month, Southwest Airlines announced that it would begin five new mainland-Hawaii routes and three new interisland routes in January. Hawaiian Airlines only flies two of the new West Coast routes: Sacramento-Honolulu and Oakland-Lihue. (Furthermore, Southwest will fly the Oakland-Lihue route just three times a week.) By contrast, Hawaiian competes directly with all four of the routes from Oakland and San Jose to Hawaii that Southwest launched this spring. HAWAIIAN AIRLINES WILL FACE INCREMENTAL COMPETITION FROM SOUTHWEST IN 2020. IMAGE SOURCE: HAWAIIAN AIRLINES. In other words, the next phase of Southwest's expansion in the mainland-Hawaii market will have a much smaller impact on Hawaiian Airlines than the growth it has withstood this year.","Aug 27, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/27/hawaiian-holdings-stock-approaches-a-multiyear-low.aspx
5,United Air stocks rise on comeback rumours | The Daily Star,United Air stocks rise on comeback rumours. Stay updated on the go with The Daily Star Android & iOS News,"United Airways was the most sought-after share on the Dhaka Stock Exchange yesterday amid rumours that the private carrier is planning to make a comeback after a lull of more than three years. The junk stock rose Tk 2.20, up 10 percent from the previous trading day, topping the gainers’ list on the day. Some 36.43 lakh shares of the out of service airline amounting to Tk 80.16 lakh changed hands thanks to the higher demand. There was hardly any seller of the stocks. United Airways began its commercial operation in 2007 and flight operations have remained suspended since 2016 due to unavailability of aircraft, among other reasons. Another junk stock, Imam Button, also made it to the gainers’ list with 6.30 percent increase. “The regulators should find out who are playing with the stocks. Otherwise general investors will lose their interest in good stocks,” said a top official of a leading merchant bank. He said all the good stocks were falling but junk stocks were rising. “This is not a good sign for the market.” The DSEX, the benchmark index of the DSE, shed 13.12 points, or 0.25 percent, to close the day at 5,223.72. The market closed flat as investors went for profit-booking and rebalancing before the beginning of the dividend declaration season for the companies whose financial year ended in June. Selling pressure was mostly observed in ceramics, cement and telecom sectors. Grameenphone continued a negative trend for the second consecutive session, UCB Capital Management said in its daily market analysis. Turnover, another important indicator of the market, dropped 2.1 percent to Tk 468.99 crore. United Power Generation dominated the turnover chart, followed by Orion Infusion, Silco Pharmaceuticals, Beacon Pharmaceuticals, and KDS Accessories. SEML IBBL Shariah Fund, a mutual fund, was the worst loser, shedding 9.90 percent. Of the traded issues, 105 gained, 214 declined, and 35 remained unchanged. The top three negative contributors to the index were British American Tobacco Bangladesh, Grameenphone and LafargeHolcim Bangladesh. Chattogram stocks also nosedived with the bourse’s benchmark index, CSCX, giving up 36.49 points, or 0.37 percent, to stand at 9,697.56. Losers beat gainers as 69 stocks advanced, 155 declined and 33 closed unchanged on the port city stock exchange.      Grameenphone:

The previous owners, Mitch and Marty Davis, who also control Cambria, a maker of stone countertops, had managed Sun Country more like a family business than a medium-sized airline. Apollo has cut costs and changed the model, dropping first class, adding fees and making more it like Frontier Airlines or Spirit Airlines than an undersized competitor to Delta Air Lines or American Airlines.

And more While Mesa Air Group, a regional carrier, went public last year, Sun Country would be the first large-jet flying U.S. airline to file for a public offering since Virgin America raised about $305 million in late 2014. The last ultra-low-cost carrier to go public was Spirit Airlines, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011. The market, however, may have changed. In 2017, Frontier Airlines, another ultra-low-cost-carrier filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating it planned a public offering. But several months later, Frontier changed course, perhaps because it couldn’t get the valuation it sought, and executives have not publicly indicated their future plans. Bricker said Sun Country sees a “window of opportunity,” and wants to ensure it does not miss it. “We just want to be ready for it, if it is open for us,” he said. “If it’s not, we will wait.” Bricker, who joined from Allegiant Air before the sale, has sought to make the airline more nimble, shedding smaller and less","Aug 27, 2019",https://skift.com/2019/08/27/u-s-discount-carrier-sun-country-airlines-prepares-for-ipo/

By: Francois Aure | Email | Leave a comment Many pundits claim that President Donald Trump lied when he assured investors that US officials had spoken with top Chinese negotiators about resuming trade talks. Echoing the stock market’s resolute response, Jim Cramer says, “So what?” In fact, the “Mad Money” host argues that Trump allegedly lying about the trade war is actually a bullish development for the US stock market.

After battling a rival bid, Transat A.T. (TRZ:CT) and Air Canada (AC:CT) now have one more thing to worry about. The gap between Transat’s share price and Air Canada’s takeover bid is sitting at the widest ever -- indicating investors aren’t confident the deal will get done. Transat’s stock fell as much as 5.9 per cent Tuesday to $15.03, the biggest drop since early July. That’s nearly $3 below Air Canada’s offer of $18 a share or $720 million, which was raised earlier this month in an attempt to fend off an unsolicited bid from Quebec real-estate developer Group Mach Inc. The tour operator’s shareholders voted 95 per cent in favour of the Air Canada bid last Friday. It’s now subject to other closing conditions, including approval under the Canadian Competition Act, the Canada Transportation Act and European Council regulations. Canada’s transport minister Marc Garneau said Monday that officials need until May to review the proposed acquisition in order to ascertain whether the deal is in the best interest of the public. The competition review is anticipated “to be the most strenuous given the overlap of the companies in Montreal and Quebec markets,” AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray said in a recent note. “The upcoming federal election could also expose the transaction to heightened levels of political discourse, which could make regulators reticent to approve relevant reviews.” However, Murray said he believes the deal will ultimately get the required approvals and will close by 2020. Scotiabank analyst Konark Gupta agreed that the deal will eventually get done but added that the “Competition Act approval could be relatively more tedious compared to other regulatory and government approvals” due to substantial overlap between the two companies in sun destinations and transatlantic markets. --With assistance from Divya Balji   Related Greg Newman's Top Picks: Dec. 18, 2020 Jason Del Vicario's Top Picks: Dec. 17, 2020 Gordon Reid's Top Picks: Dec. 16, 2020  ","Aug 27, 2019",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/air-canada-s-transat-takeover-looks-shakier-than-ever-to-market-1.1307391

U.S. stock markets fell after taking their lead from the bond market, which responded to the deepest yield curve inversion since 2007. The two- and 10-year government bond yields reached their highest inverted rates as 10-year Treasuries fell more than five basis points on the day, said Erik Bregar, head of currency strategy at the Exchange Bank of Canada. ""It's definitely a headline grabber,"" he said in an interview. ""It's the most popular, public indicator of recession. Everybody knows the 2s over 10s curve and it just continues to deepen so that's why I think markets are a little concerned about today."" Stocks fell as soon as the gap between the two- and 10-year curves further deepened into the red. ""If I were an equity trader and I saw the yield curve inversion deepen today I'd be like, Hey something's wrong."" Despite ongoing concerns about trade talks between the U.S. and China, bond markets are worried about more than a few billion dollars in tariffs going back and forth between the world's two largest economies, Bregar said. ""I think they're looking at broader banking liquidity worldwide potentially, some issues with the funding market, yield inversions all over the place and recessionary signals,"" he said. The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 84.80 points at 16,183.59. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 120.93 points at 25,777.90.

A financial planner says there's a 'huge opportunity' for new investors to make money during a recession, as long","    Personal Finance Insider writes about products, strategies, and tips to help you make smart decisions with your money. We may receive a small commission from our partners, like American Express, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. An economic recession can cause incomes to fall or stagnate, make it more difficult to pay down expensive debts, and generally heighten anxiety around money. But a lull in the markets can also be a boon to your wealth if you take the right steps — and most importantly, give it time, says Lauren Anastasio, a certified financial planner at SoFi, a personal-finance company. ""The younger you are, the longer you have to be invested, the more advantageous getting into the market when prices are low will be,"" Anastasio told Business Insider. Anastasio likens the idea to shopping during a sale at the mall. ""People very well understand the concept of, 'this is the price of a good, I want to buy it when it's cheaper,'"" she says. ""When the markets go down, whether there's a day where markets are down or we're going through some type of bigger market downturn, that really just means everything is on sale,"" Anastasio says. ""Everything is cheaper than it was a day ago, a week ago, and that's when it can be most advantageous to us to buy into the market because you're getting those same securities and the same number of shares at a cheaper price, and you're going to continue to own those shares as they increase in value over time,"" she says. The concept of ""buy low, sell high"" is nothing new, but it works for building wealth. It's an investment strategy made famous by Warren Buffett, who often advises investors to ""be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful."" By investing at the bottom of the market when valuable stocks are cheapest, your money has even greater earning potential when it sits for an extended period of time. Buffett is a champion of the buy-and-hold strategy — and when he sells, it usually doesn't have much to do with price or market conditions and everything to do with fine-tuning his long-term strategy. After all, Buffett believes the best wealth-generating investments are long term. To be sure, most financial experts recommend investing only after you've paid off high-interest debt and set","Aug 27, 2019",https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-make-money-during-a-recession-financial-planner-advice-2019-8

17,Why Air Canada's (TSX:AC) Acquisition of Transat (TSX:TRZ) Could Fall Through - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why Air Canada’s (TSX:AC) Acquisition of Transat (TSX:TRZ) Could Fall Through. Here’s,"      David Jagielski | August 27, 2019 | More on: AC TRZ There have been some seismic moves in the airline industry this year, particularly in Canada. The biggest may have been when WestJet Airlines announced that it was going private. In addition to that, rival Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) was purchasing Transat AT (TSX:TRZ). Both of these moves could have an impact on competition in the industry but in very different ways. WestJet going private means that there could be a change in responsibilities and goals for the company. Sometimes that could result in an even greater focus on cost-cutting or whatever else the new owner may want to make a priority. However, it doesn’t result in fewer options for travellers. The Air Canada purchase of Air Transat does impact competition, and that’s why it still has to undergo a public interest assessment. Although the deal has been approved by shareholders of Transat recently, the government has until May 2, 2020, to complete the assessment, which will include an “analysis of the economic benefits or challenges resulting from the proposed transaction.” At a minimum, we could see the deal being delayed until then. At worse, the deal might not go through at all. In the public interest assessment, the federal competition commissioner will be asked for input, and that could weigh heavily on whether the deal goes through. There isn’t a lot of competition within the airline industry in Canada, and a merger between Transat and Air Canada would significantly reduce it even further. While there are discount airlines that have popped up over the years, Transat is one of the bigger airlines in the country. Competition-related issues have thwarted mergers and acquisitions in the past. The merger between Staples and Office Depot is a good example where the companies saw resistance both in Canada and the U.S. and ultimately the deal fell through. In this case, Air Canada and WestJet will still be the main competitors in the industry, but there could be a big change in how competitive the companies will be. However, it’s not just large deals that are in question; smaller purchases can be rejected by the government as well. Last year, Corus Entertainment tried to sell French-language channels to BCE for approximately $200 million, and that was rejected by the Commissioner of Competition. The Air Canada-Transat deal will certainly have","Aug 27, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/08/27/why-air-canadas-tsxac-acquisition-of-transat-tsxtrz-could-fall-through/

Let us bring the summary of the","  Indian stock markets are expected to continue to rise on Tuesday following liquidity support by Reserve Bank of India and firm global cues. The RBI said on Monday that it will transfer ₹1.76 trillion to the government this fiscal. The additional amount of ₹86,000 crore that the government will receive this year above its budgeted ₹90,000 crore as transfers from RBI could be either used to provide fiscal stimulus to a sagging economy, reduce off-balance sheet borrowings or meet the expected shortfall in revenue collections. Among global markets, Asian stocks tracked global peers higher on Tuesday while safe-haven bonds sold off as signs Sino-US trade hostilities might be easing helped restore investor confidence after the previous session’s rout. Supporting the market mood, US President Donald Trump on Monday flagged the possibility of a trade deal with China and said he believe Beijing was sincere in its desire to reach an agreement. Global markets had been roiled at the start of the week by new tariffs from the world’s two largest economies. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2% after dropping 1.3% the previous day. South Korea’s Kopsi added 0.8% and Japan’s Nikkei rose 1%. Equity markets may have found traction for now but the longer-term outlook for risk assets, buffeted repeatedly by trade concerns, remained shaky. Back home, lenders to Jet Airways (India) Ltd have extended until Saturday the deadline for submitting expressions of interest (EoIs) to invest in the grounded airline to accommodate a potential bidder, which submitted an EoI after the expiry of the deadline, according to a Mint report. Public sector oil marketing companies — Indian Oil Corp (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) — that have restricted aviation fuel supply to Air India Ltd at six domestic tier two airports due to non-payment of dues to the tune of ₹5,000 crore by the national carrier, will not resume fuel supply unless the national carrier assures them in a written communication about its payment plans, according to a Mint report.

The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies stood at 98.027, having risen about 0.5% overnight.
