1,Airline Stocks Spike as the Bears Dig In | Barron's,"Airline Stocks Spike as the Bears Dig In. Credit Suisse’s Jose Caiado summed up the prevailing sentiment, writing that American","  Airline stocks continued to soar on Friday, with some of the most beaten-down ones rallying more than 20%, following huge moves on Thursday. But analysts expressed skepticism that the big moves reflected anything more than a short squeeze, as investors who had bet against the stocks bought shares to cover their positions. Shares of American Airlines Group (ticker: AAL) surged a record 41% on Thursday to $16.72 after the carrier announced an upgraded summer flight schedule in which it plans to rebuild domestic capacity to 55% of 2019 levels and international flights to 20%. The stock continued to soar Friday, gaining more than 21% in recent trading. Other heavily shorted airline stocks also rallied, with Spirit Airlines (SAVE) gaining 20% and United Airlines Holdings (UAL) up more than 18%. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth is unimpressed, cutting her rating on American stock to Underperform from Neutral and arguing that shares are now “priced to perfection.” Credit Suisse’s Jose Caiado summed up the prevailing sentiment, writing that “AAL’s share price reaction is confounding.” While the carrier’s summer schedule announcement was a sign of improving demand, “it certainly wasn’t incrementally positive to the tune of a 41% move in AAL’s share price.” He maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Investors shouldn’t lose sight of American’s $40 billion total debt load, including more than $28 billion in long-term debt, and high-single-digit leverage ratio, based on 2021 estimates, “that the company will need to dig out of.” He expects that earnings “will remain negative next year, weighed down by the heavy interest burden.” J.P. Morgan’s Jamie Baker reiterated his Underperform rating, writing that third-quarter consensus revenue estimates still remain too high. While the airline’s commentary “feels good,” he wrote, “these aren’t the catalysts you’re looking for.” Analysts are now modeling a 64% decline in third-quarter revenue compared with last year, but the decline may be closer to 70% by his math, suggesting that “consensus earnings and liquidity forecasts may actually prove too ambitious.” One wrinkle that investors may be missing, Baker adds, is that American pledged some of its mileage-program assets to the U.S. Treasury as collateral for $4.8 billion in federally backed loans under the Cares Act. If the Treasury rejects the collateralization, however, “the risk of an American bankruptcy would materially rise, in our view.” The Treasury may demand a chunk of the assets, or none at all.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   After being paralyzed for months by dwindling air-travel demand due to the coronavirus-fueled crisis, aviation stocks are finally having something to cheer about. The most recent boost came from the airline heavyweight, American Airlines AAL on Jun 4. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Fort Worth, TX-based carrier announced that it will push up its capacity for July owing to improving trends for air-travel demand. The update naturally pleased investors, leading to a 41.25% surge in the carrier’s stock price to $16.74. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. In fact, the positivity was not limited to American Airlines alone since it appreciated the share price of other industry participants as well. Notably, Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL, Southwest Airlines LUV and Spirit Airlines SAVE gained 13.7%, 16.2%, 5.1% and 21.4%, respectively, yesterday. With most industry players exhibiting an uptrend, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index rallied 10.12% to close Thursday’s trading session at $62.94. American Airlines’ Plan of Action With passenger demand slowly returning to normalcy, management at American Airlines stated that it intends to operate 55% of its domestic scheduled flights in July 2020 compared with July 2019.  In fact, with travel restrictions easing, the airline saw an uptick in travel demand in May as well. Notably, Vasu Raja, the carrier’s senior vice president of Network Strategy, said that “We’re seeing a slow but steady rise in domestic demand”. Evidently, the company flew nearly 110,000 passengers per day on average in the last week of May. The reading marks a 71% jump from the total 32,000 passengers carried per day on average in April. As a result of the bounce in traffic on American Airlines’ flights, the load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) soared to 55% in the last week of May from a mere 15% in April. What is more encouraging is that international demand is also seeing a recovery, albeit at a slower pace. As a result, American Airlines aims to operate nearly 20% of its internal flights scheduled for July compared with July","Jun 5, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-stocks-mend-comeback-possible-131401062.html
4,Why Airline Shares Are Rallying Higher Again Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Rallying Higher Again Today. It now appears the selloff was overdone. So too could be the,"   A wave of euphoria is sweeping through the airline sector as investors react to some positive signs suggesting a recovery is at hand. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) led the sector higher for the second straight day, up more than 20% at 11 a.m. EDT, but the rally was widespread. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were up double-digits, and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) gained more than 4% apiece. Airline stocks were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with travel demand falling more than 90% and revenue all but evaporating. The airlines responded by raising liquidity, in part thanks to the CARES Act government stimulus plan, but unless demand for travel returns, the carriers are going to eventually face liquidity issues. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. In recent days, we've seen indications that the worst might be behind us. On Thursday, American said it was restoring a significant number of flights as travel interest has returned. The airline said it averaged 110,330 passengers per day in the last week of May, more than triple the 32,154 daily passenger average for April. The Transportation Security Administration said Friday that Thursday was the busiest day for airline security screeners since March 22, handling 391,882 travelers. A better-than-expected jobs report also gave a lift to the broader markets, as it was viewed as a sign the economy is beginning to recover. It appears we are in the early stages of a recovery, but the emphasis is on ""early stages."" American is bringing back flights but will still only fly about 55% of its July 2019 capacity. TSA screening numbers are improving, but the agency screened 2,634,947 passengers on June 5, 2019, meaning traffic is still down 85% year over year. At best, we are still looking at a multiyear recovery, and airline balance sheets will be bruised from the debt they have taken on to survive the crisis for years to come. At worst, there's still a risk that a second wave of the pandemic will hit later this year, and the industry will be right back at square one if it does. Even after this week's rally, airline stocks are still down between 22% and 48% year to date. The valuations remain attractive, and there's enough reason for","Jun 5, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/05/why-airline-shares-are-rallying-higher-again-today.aspx
5,Why Latin American Airline Stocks Are Up Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Latin American Airline Stocks Are Up Today. The region is reopening, for better or for worse.. What happened. So","   Latin America is beginning to reopen after the COVID-19 pandemic. That, coupled with a surge in U.S. airline shares on improving domestic travel trends, has investors focused on buying into Latin American airlines. Shares of Brazilian airlines Azul (NYSE:AZUL) and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (NYSE:GOL) each closed up 14% on Friday, while shares of Mexico's Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, or Volaris (NYSE:VLRS), closed up 10%. Airline stocks around the globe have plunged due to the pandemic, which has caused travel demand to all but evaporate. Latin American airlines have seen their traffic impacted far more than most, as they are more reliant on international travel than their U.S. counterparts. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The region has seen two of the largest airline bankruptcies year to date, with Colombia's Avianca Holdings and Chile's Latam Airlines Group both flying into Chapter 11 protection in the U.S., and shares of Azul, Gol, and Volaris all lost close to 70% of their value at one point in 2020 on fears they could be forced to join them. The airlines are still troubled, but recent news has provided a tailwind for the industry. Brazil is beginning to wind down shelter-in-place orders, starting with tourist hotbed Rio de Janeiro, and Mexico president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said it was time to restart tourism ""for the good of the people."" Investors in these New York-traded shares are buying in likely fully aware of what has happened in the U.S. as state economies have begun to open. Security screeners working for the U.S. Transportation Security Administration had their busiest day since March 22 on Thursday, indicating that at least in the U.S. there is pent-up demand for travel as restrictions are lifted. It feels premature to call the pandemic over, either in the U.S. or elsewhere. In Brazil and Mexico, the restrictions are being lifted despite new COVID-19 cases continuing to rise. Some of this rally is likely based on growing investor confidence that these airlines can avoid the fate of Avianca and Latam and stay out of bankruptcy. That's a positive, but we are still a long way away from getting back to normal. Rising COVID-19 cases make the situation all the more uncertain in Latin America. Investors need to be aware that volatility, like the pandemic, is likely not over yet.

6,Airline Stocks Just Posted Their Best Week on Record - U.S. Global Investors - Commentaries - Advisor Perspectives,. Airline Stocks Just Posted Their Best Week on Record. Airline Investors Rebuff Buffett. . . . . . .," Today I’d like to start by lending my voice in support of those who seek to bring attention to and rectify the deeply rooted societal inequities that contributed to the senseless killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmed Aubrey and others. Racism has no place in America. Full stop. Many Americans understand and empathize with the outrage, even if they don’t necessarily agree with the looting and violence that have defined some of the protests. A vast majority of the demonstrators want only to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully, and it’s unfortunate when a few bad actors are allowed to hijack the protests. Like the coronavirus pandemic and economic downturn, the civil unrest has generated a lot of fear and uncertainty among Americans.  But there are signs that the worst is behind us. The daily rate of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. has been steadily decreasing. And today, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. added a staggering 2.5 million payrolls in May, suggesting a strong economic recovery is underway. Much work still needs to be done, but I’m equally confident a satisfactory solution to the unrest can be reached. click to enlarge President Donald Trump addressed the blowout jobs numbers in a press conference today, comparing the U.S. economy to a “rocket ship.” Economists had been expecting the unemployment rate to jump higher in May, possibly to as much as 20 percent, but it ended up falling last month, from 14.7 percent in April to 13.3 percent. Trump praised the domestic airline industry, saying carriers are recovering nicely with the economic reopening. On Thursday, shares of American Airlines stock exploded an unbelievable 41 percent, the most on record for a single day, after the carrier said it would increase July flights 74 percent compared with this month. Meanwhile, more and more planes are returning to the sky, with the number of parked passenger aircraft dropping below 50 percent of all fleets in the U.S., Europe and China, according to Bloomberg. A one-time airline operator himself, Trump also singled out Warren Buffett, who announced in early May that he sold his positions in the four major carriers due to the spread of the coronavirus.

""Warren Buffett sold airlines a little while ago,"" Trump said. ""He's been right his whole life, but sometimes even someone like Warren Buffett — I have a lot of respect for him — they make mistakes."" He added, ""They should have kept the airline stocks, because the airline stocks went through the roof today.""

Trump addressed the nation after the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed that the US economy added 2.5 million jobs in May, upending economists' forecasts of 7.5 million job losses.

11,Donald Trump says Warren Buffett makes a mistake selling airline stocks | Reuters,Donald Trump says Warren Buffett makes a mistake selling airline stocks. . . . . . . . . .,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Jonathan Stempel 2 MIN READ (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said Warren Buffett, often regarded as the world’s greatest investor, made a mistake by recently exiting a multi-billion dollar investment in the airline industry. Trump made his assessment at the White House, shortly after the U.S. Labor Department reported an unexpected surge in May jobs, and five weeks after Buffett said his Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N sold its airline stakes. “Warren Buffett sold airlines a little while ago,” Trump said. “He’s been right his whole life, but sometimes even somebody like Warren Buffett -- I have a lot of respect for him -- they make mistakes. They should have kept the airline stocks because the airline stocks went through the roof today.” Buffett did not immediately respond to a request for comment through his assistant. At Berkshire's May 2 annual meeting, Buffett said his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate had in April sold its roughly $6 billion of stock in American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O, Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N, Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N and United AIrlines Holdings Inc UAL.O. Buffett said the coronavirus pandemic had changed the industry “in a very major way,” through no fault of the carriers, leaving the future of flying “much less clear.” Many airline stocks have outpaced the broader market this week, as carriers took steps to restore some flights they had canceled because of the pandemic. American, Delta, Southwest and United rose after the Labor Department said U.S. nonfarm payrolls grew by 2.51 million in May, and the jobless rate fell to 13.3% from April’s 14.7%. Economists on average expected a loss of 8 million jobs, and a 19.8% unemployment rate. Berkshire's stock is lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX for a second straight year.

What you need to know about growing cyberattacks.,"June 5, 2020 7:51 PM GMT+3         Subscribe to How To Reopen, our weekly newsletter on what it takes to reboot business in the midst of a pandemic.

American Airlines' stock is flying higher as investors look to signs that the economy is beginning to recover—and flight demand with it.

The airline stock surged Thursday, then again led the S&P 500 higher on Friday morning, trading up roughly 15% for a two day gain of over 60% by midday. Fellow airlines United Airlines and Delta Airlines were also up over 13% and 8% respectively by midday.

The boost in airline stocks comes as states begin to reopen and restrictions start loosening. That's led several companies including American Airlines to announce they are boosting flight capacity in the coming months. American Airlines said Thursday it plans to fly 55% of its domestic schedule and 20% of its international schedule in July—a massive boost from last month, when it only flew 20% of its schedule from the previous year in May.

""We’re seeing a slow but steady rise in domestic demand. After a careful review of the data, we’ve built a July schedule to match,"" Vasu Raja, senior vice president of network strategy at American Airlines, said in a press release. The announcement pushed the airline's stock up over 40% on Thursday—it's best one-day boost ever. In fact, those trends in increasing load size are what Burkett Huey, an aerospace analyst at Morningstar, call ""the most encouraging sign."" Yet he sees it ""more as limiting 2020 losses—that’s the positive news,"" he told Fortune. According to Huey, American's stock is higher on Friday due to ""the recent load factor trends, which are indicating that people are getting more comfortable flying than they were just two months ago."" Flights have been modestly increasing in recent weeks, with nearly 400,000 passengers passing through TSA checkpoints on Thursday, according to TSA daily data (still a yawning gulf from its year-ago period, which saw over 2.6 million). Meanwhile, US Global Jets, an airline exchange-traded fund with the ticker JETS, has seen a massive surge in assets in recent months, boosting its inflows from $33 million in March to over $1 billion, helped in part by its recent popularity on trading platform Robinhood. But the recent optimism comes off a period of heavy battering for the industry amid world-wide shutdowns due to the coronavirus, which","Jun 5, 2020",https://fortune.com/2020/06/05/american-airlines-stock-adds-to-yesterdays-41-gain-as-reopening-optimism-soars/

International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that airlines globally will lose at least $314 billion due to the outbreak. As a result, you'd want an Airline stocks list to look at. The epic crash and burn in airline stock prices have left many investors wondering if now is the time to buy? Considering the fact that they've hit rock bottom, is it even possible they can go further?   It has gotten so bad that the Oracle of Omaha completely exited his Airline positions, citing forthcoming turbulence. Around the same time, Air Canada - Canada's biggest Carrier released a dire quarterly report stating it would take at least three more years to reach 2019 revenue levels.  At this point, many investors are wondering if it's time to buy the dip. Before committing your hard-earned capital, here are a few things to be aware of if you're considering buying airline stocks after the 2020 market crash. If you want more stocks lists, click here. I don't think I have to mention the elephant in the room, but the world has mostly been in lock down. Lock down means no one is allowed to go anywhere. And the effects couldn't be more apparent than in Air Canada's most recent quarterly report. I suggest you sit down for this. In the last quarter alone, Air Canada lost a staggering $1.05 billion (yes billion) and saw its revenue decline by $712 million. Overall, Air Canada (TSX:AC) fell 68%, from a 52-week high of $52.71 to a low of $9.27 and remains down. As of the time of this blog post writing, Air Canada was trading at $20.29. Our Airline stocks list looks at other Airlines as well. If you'd like to talk about the moves Airlines are making, make sure to check out our trading room.

As you probably figured out by the name, Cargojet transports cargo (goods), not people. Not only has Cargojet survived this global crisis, but they've also thrived, realizing a 12% revenue increase last quarter.
