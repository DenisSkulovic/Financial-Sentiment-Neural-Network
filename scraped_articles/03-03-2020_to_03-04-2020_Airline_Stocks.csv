8,Why Shares of Major U.S. Airlines Declined in February | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Major U.S. Airlines Declined in February. Coronavirus fears caused legacy carrier shares to plummet.. What happened. So,"   Shares of the legacy U.S. airlines all lost altitude in February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, caught in the broader COVID-19 coronavirus-related market downdraft. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) traded down 29%, while shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) each lost more than 17% during the month. Although some of the market sell-off over coronavirus was likely fueled by uncertainty, the outbreak will definitely have a significant effect on first quarter results due to canceled flights and lost revenue. The ""big three"" airlines all canceled flights to China in late January after near-term demand for travel plummeted, and have selectively suspended other routes in response to coronavirus-related fears. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The stocks were hit hard in January due to the fears. What caused the sell-off to accelerate in late February was the spread of the coronavirus into new markets, including the first cases in the United States. Investors fretted that the coronavirus-related headlines would weigh on U.S. consumers as they plan summer vacation travel, potentially depressing demand during the peak summer season. Virus concerns also caused a number of companies to suspend non-essential business travel, eating into a key profit center for these large, legacy airlines. American was hit particularly hard because it is seen as the most vulnerable of the major U.S. airlines to a prolonged travel slowdown. The airline has the highest debt burden among U.S. airlines, and going into 2020 had intended to use profits generated this year to pay down some of that debt.  AIRLINE DATA BY YCHARTS United, meanwhile, is the major U.S. airline with the most exposure to Asia. United gets about 10% of its revenue from Asia and has about 15% of its total capacity tied to the region, compared to 9% for Delta and 6% for American. Delta might not be as big in the region as United, but the company does own a stake in one of the largest Chinese airlines and has targeted its relationship with Korean Air as a source of growth. The markets hate uncertainty, and there is no way to say how aggressively the coronavirus will spread globally or how long it will take to get the outbreak under control. Until there is more clarity, it is going to be difficult for these stocks to take off. That said, there is","Mar 3, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/03/why-shares-of-major-us-airlines-declined-in-februa.aspx

The Federal Reserve announced an emergency rate cut of 50 basis points – its first unscheduled cut since the financial crisis – and while Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy remains “strong,” stocks sold off as some on the Street wondered if things are worse than they might seem. Here’s the latest: Stocks finished the day sharply lower, marking a reversal from Monday’s surge which saw all the major averages post their largest point gain in history. The Dow fell 785 points, or 2.94%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 2.8% and 3%, respectively. Earlier in the session stocks rallied after the Federal Reserve announced an emergency 50 basis point rate cut, but markets couldn’t hold onto the gains and stocks moved lower throughout the day. At the session low, the Dow dropped 997.04 points. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury also broke below 1% for the first time ever as investors piled into the so-called safe haven asset. - Stevens The crazy market volatility is starting to wear on the psyche of market traders. The Dow has moved more than 1,000 points intraday in four of the last six sessions. “The market has become uninvestible,” Joe Zicherman from Stadium Capital told CNBC’s Bob Pisani. “You cannot manage money on an active basis when the Dow is up 1,000 one day, and then down 1,000 the next day.” Another active trader said he was simply reducing the size of his portfolio: “I’m bringing down my gross,” he said. “I’m shrinking my long and short positions.” That “de-grossing,” as traders refer to it, will ultimately serve to reduce market volatility down the road, but for the moment the head spinning trading, and the inability to correctly interpret the Fed’s moves (ahead of the curve? Needlessly wasting bullets?) has traders anxious and nervous. - Pisani Frederick Mishkin, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2008, praised the central bank’s emergency rate cut on “Closing Bell,” saying that the cut was proactive and shows that the Fed has learned some of the lessons from the financial crisis. “The Fed understands that even before the data actually shows that there is a problem, that this shock is going to effect the economy in a negative way.

13,Coronavirus: Airline CEOs to meet with Mike Pence as virus hits business,US airline CEOs to meet with Pence amid rift over passenger data collection to combat coronavirus. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"U.S. airline CEOs and an industry trade group are scheduled to meet with Vice President Mike Pence in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, as the coronavirus roils the business. Airline stocks have tumbled to multiyear lows and have become a standout in the market rout. The virus, which has infected more than 90,000 people, has sapped demand as corporations pause lucrative business travel as the illness spreads. Carriers including Delta, American and United have suspended China routes and have made cuts on other international routes. United’s CEO, Oscar Munoz, warned staff on Saturday that further cuts are likely, CNBC reported. Airlines have bristled at efforts by officials to get passenger data to track potential travelers who have been infected with the virus.  Not all passenger reservations contain contact data for travelers, noted Airlines for America, a trade group that represents major U.S. carriers including United, American and Delta. About 74% have a phone number and 56% have an email, according to a letter the group sent to the Department of Health and Human Services last month, which was seen by CNBC. The agency should set up an online link for arriving international passengers to provide contact information to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the letter said. “This online option would eliminate the need for the airlines to act as an intermediary, and it would create a government-mandated one-on-one, more immediate relationship between a passenger and the CDC,” said the letter.

The deadly outbreak has prompted many companies to put a moratorium on business travel, while other travelers are opting to cancel trips to avoid the risk of infection. Global carriers, including United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, have suspended flights to China, but have also made cuts to other routes in Asia. Cathay Pacific said it would reduce 40 percent of its capacity and suspend routes from Newark, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C., along with some destinations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. United announced Wednesday it would trim 20 percent of its international routes. SFO airport is so empty!

'It's safe' to fly: Trump with airline execs 01:46 “We don’t need any bailouts here,” U.S. Chamber Chief Executive Tom Donohue said at a news conference with travel leaders aimed at reassuring Americans to keep traveling. “Bottom line is we’re going to run just like business as usual - with a little higher heartbeat and get it done.” Hours later United Airlines UAL.O said it would slash 20% of international flights and 10% of U.S. flights in April as it launched a hiring freeze, voluntary unpaid leaves and delayed salary increases for executives. It plans similar flight cuts for May. Company leaders warned employees the cuts may not be enough depending on future demand. President Donald Trump said at a meeting with airline executives later on Wednesday that they had not sought any financial assistance. “We haven’t discussed that,” Trump said. Roger Dow, who heads the U.S. Travel Association, said at the same event as Donohue that he considers a bailout unnecessary, but suggested the government could take steps to boost demand for travel. Travel industry officials said the government could reinstate some tax incentives to encourage business travel and spend additional funds to promote U.S. travel destinations. RELATED COVERAGE  Analysts at Rabobank said in a research note on Wednesday that “financially, given the huge blow that airlines and other service-sector firms are likely to suffer, we are also certain to see state aid and/or bailouts to key firms, even if this is technically illegal in some countries currently. We might also face some temporary quasi-nationalizations once again, as during 2008-09.” Trump and Vice President Mike Pence met with the chief executives of American Airlines AAL.O, United, Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N and other major airlines to discuss the coronavirus outbreak and the business outlook for the industry. U.S. airline stocks have fallen - some as much as 40% in recent weeks, though they recovered slightly on Wednesday.
