1,Is Spirit Airlines (SAVE) A Good Pick for Value Investors? | Nasdaq,Is Spirit Airlines (SAVE) A Good Pick for Value Investors?. TRENDING TOPICS. TRENDING ARTICLES. OTHER TOPICS. Latest Markets Videos. Zacks.,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?

One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:

PE Ratio

A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.

On this front, Spirit Airlines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7.31, as you can see in the chart below: This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.77. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Spirit Airlines’ current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 11.94) over the past five years. Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Transportation sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.94. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.   We should also point out that Spirit Airlines has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 7.87, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.

P/S Ratio

Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks","Dec 16, 2019",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-spirit-airlines-save-a-good-pick-for-value-investors-2019-12-16
2,What Is Southwest Airlines Co.'s (NYSE:LUV) Share Price Doing? - Simply Wall St News,What Is Southwest Airlines Co.'s (NYSE:LUV) Share Price Doing?. What's the opportunity in Southwest Airlines?. Can we expect growth from,"Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$58.26 and falling to the lows of US$52.04. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Southwest Airlines's current trading price of US$54.35 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Southwest Airlines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my relative valuation model. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 12.16x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 8.95x, which means if you buy Southwest Airlines today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe Southwest Airlines should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Southwest Airlines’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 10% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Southwest Airlines. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in LUV’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such","Dec 17, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-luv/southwest-airlines/news/what-is-southwest-airlines-co-s-nyseluv-share-price-doing
3,Record rally should extend into 2020: Market bull Jim Paulsen,Market bull Jim Paulsen predicts the record US rally will extend into 2020 – but he sees an even better,"Strategist Jim Paulsen expects 2020 to be another banner year for stocks. The Leuthold Group’s chief investment strategist wouldn’t be surprise if the S&P 500 soars another 15% next year, but the long-time bull doubts it will be the best market on the planet. Paulsen is so optimistic, he believes going global will give investors even bigger profits. “This will be like the third time we’ve had re-acceleration in the global recovery just in this expansion alone. We had it in 2012 and 2013. We had it again in 2017 [and] 2018,” he told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Monday. “Every time that’s happened, international stocks have beat U.S. stocks, and I think they will again.” Paulsen’s 2020 strategy includes under-weighting U.S. stocks and going for the hardest hit markets. “The emerging markets will be the big winner of 2020,” said Paulsen. “They’re under-owned in most portfolios. They’re unloved because of their underperformance in recent years.” The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which is exposed to developing economies including China and India, is down 5% during the past two years. Paulsen has been firmly in the U.S. bull camp this year. On Aug. 30, he predicted on “Trading Nation” that the major indexes would break out by year’s end due to overstated fear in the market. Since then, the S&P 500 is up about 10%. When stocks were plummeting last December, he characterized Wall Street as too bearish. His 2019 bullish calls paid off. The S&P 500 has surged 27% this year while the Dow has risen 21%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has grabbed 33%. On Monday, the major indexes closed at all-time highs. He expects stocks will push deeper into record territory despite high valuations as long as the 10-year Treasury note yield stays below 3%. According to Paulsen, the rally could persist at these higher valuations for some time. “We have very low inflation,” he noted. “But more important, we have very stable inflation. We have the least volatile consumer price inflation rate over the last 30 years of any time in U.S. history.” His favorite market groups in this environment are small caps, technology, financials and some industrials. “They [investors] have been piling into bonds and defensive stocks,” Paulsen said. “They’re going to have to come back to more of the cyclical areas of the stock market.” Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip?

McConnell Hopeful for Stimulus Bill Agreement,"Boeing  (BA) - Get Report is losing altitude on Monday, down 3.5% on reports that it may halt or cut production of its 737 MAX jet. The plane maker has not been able to put its 737 MAX woes behind it, as it has weighed on the stock price and investor sentiment for several quarters at this point. While Boeing will be fine from financial perspective - it still has a deep order log and healthy cash flows - the loss of one of its best-selling models is certainly not a positive catalyst for the company. It also doesn’t help that Boeing is now losing the orders and deliveries battle to Airbus. It’s also been a frustrating situation for airlines companies like Southwest Airlines  (LUV) - Get Report and American Airlines  (AAL) - Get Report, which utilize the currently grounded 737 MAX.  Monday's developments are so intriguing that Real Money has selected Boeing as its Stock of the Day. Let’s look at the charts. Daily chart of Boeing stock.  Chart courtesy of Stockcharts.com The setup in Boeing has been pretty simple: It’s range-bound between support and resistance. Unfortunately though, headlines have been the driving factor for the share price. Earnings and price action are not leading the way. Instead, developments with its 737 MAX jet, conversations with the FAA and rumors on production are leading the way. Headlines will move stocks and that’s true in most scenarios. There’s not much investors can do about it as it’s just part of the game. That said, it would be nice if Boeing traded more on the technicals than on the news. Until this phase passes, investors have to be aware of the stock's primary driver.  In that case, buyers can continue to step in between $320 and $330 as that’s where range support has continued to buoy the name. Should support hold, look for BA stock to rebound. The first upside targets are its now-declining major moving averages. Currently, they are clustered between $352 and $359. Above that and range resistance near $375 is in play. If range support begins to fail, the August lows at $317.70 will be on watch. Below that and $300 will be on the table, along with the 52-week low of $292.47.

LiveCoronavirus live news: Boris Johnson announces new tier 4,"Ripple effects dent stocks in airlines and aircraft suppliers around the world  The ripple effects of Boeing’s decision to suspend production of the grounded 737 Max aircraft were felt around the world on Tuesday as shares in global suppliers to the US planemaker fell sharply. Boeing temporarily suspended production of the grounded 737 Max aircraft on Monday after the Federal Aviation Administration said it would not approve the plane’s return to service before 2020. More than 700 Max jets were grounded around the world in March following two fatal crashes that claimed 346 lives.  The grounding has already cost Boeing more than $9bn (£6.85bn) in customer compensation and extra costs. The 737 Max was previously Boeing’s best-selling plane, with 580 deliveries during 2018. Boeing’s overall deliveries had fallen by half during the first nine months of the year. Brett Ryan, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank, said he estimated the shutdown would knock 0.4 percentage points off real GDP growth in the US in the current quarter and the start of next year. Shares of Kansas-based Spirit Aerosystems, Boeing’s largest supplier and maker of the Max fuselage along with other parts, fell 3.4% on Monday and were down 2% on Tuesday. Senior, which makes airframe and engine components for the Max, was the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 index down 11% on Tuesday. Boeing is the biggest customer for Senior’s aerospace division, which has been hit by a fall in revenues in recent months, partly because of the grounding of the 737 Max. CFM International, a joint venture between France’s Safran and General Electric that supplies engines to the Max, will also be hit by the shutdown. The Max’s problems are expected to badly affect GE. When Boeing cut monthly production of the plane to 42 from 52 in April, GE suffered a $400m quarterly reduction in cash flow. Safran shares fell by 1.2%. While Boeing’s British manufacturing footprint is limited, it spends £2bn a year with 300 UK suppliers. They include the engineering group Senior, the defence technology firm QinetiQ, and the aerospace and defence firms Meggitt and Ultra Electronics. QinetiQ shares fell 0.7%; Meggitt, which makes the fire detector system for the Max engine and auxiliary power unit, slipped 1.5%; and Ultra Electronics, which supplies wing ice protection systems to Boeing, lost 1.1%.

And if history repeats, this super cycle will hand out profits of 8X to 18X, starting now. If you’ve studied investing, you’ve likely come across the idea of “cyclical” assets. Cyclical assets go through boom and bust cycles. One year they surge in price... the next year they plummet. Housing stocks are cyclical... airline stocks are cyclical... gold is famously cyclical. Most commodities like oil, wheat, and steel are cyclical. The key to cyclicality is it is predictable. When you know a moneymaking upcycle is coming, you can often ride it to big profits with little risk. Let me tell you about a new super cycle that was just born in a quiet corner of the markets... Like other cyclical assets, the “video game super cycle” has everything to do with supply and demand. You see, a new generation of video game consoles comes out every five to eight years. These new consoles run faster than previous versions. They feature better graphics and offer new games. This isn’t just a big deal for “gamers.” It’s a mammoth opportunity for investors. During the last video game boom, you could have pocketed returns of 8X… 14X… and 18X in just six years! It said it will release its highly anticipated PlayStation 5 video game console next year. Microsoft (MSFT) will also introduce its “next-gen” console—code named “Project Scarlett”—just in time for the 2020 holidays. The video game industry has been waiting years for this news. Sony last made an announcement like this in February 2013 when it unveiled the PlayStation 4. Eight months later, PlayStation 4 hit the shelves. Microsoft rolled out its own system, Xbox One, a week later. Since then, Sony has sold more than 90 million PS4s! Microsoft has sold 44 million Xbox Ones.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Costamare Inc. (NYSE:CMRE) share price has soared 115% return in just a single year. It's also good to see the share price up 49% over the last quarter. Also impressive, the stock is up 65% over three years, making long term shareholders happy, too. See our latest analysis for Costamare While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. Costamare was able to grow EPS by 122% in the last twelve months. We note that the earnings per share growth isn't far from the share price growth (of 115%). This makes us think the market hasn't really changed its sentiment around the company, in the last year. We don't think its coincidental that the share price is growing at a similar rate to the earnings per share. You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). We know that Costamare has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained. When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Costamare the TSR over the last year was 130%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   America’s newest and perhaps most innovative airline does not yet have a name, or any airplanes. But it now has a headquarters. David Neeleman’s startup will be based in Salt Lake City, where it plans to spend a capital investment of $3.2 million and create nearly 400 jobs over the next five years, according to local authorities. In return, the state offered tax rebates worth as much as about $1.1 million over five years. “There’s a super strong technology base, and lower cost of living than California and some of the coastal areas,” Lukas Johnson, the airline’s chief commericial said in an interview. “We want to focus more on the technology aspect of the transportation side, and it makes a lot of sense. The tech sector is booming out here.” In putting his startup in Salt Lake City, Neeleman, who also founded JetBlue Airways, may have sought to correct one issue that once plagued his former employer. When Neeleman started JetBlue, he created a satellite office in Utah, but based it in New York City, near its largest hub at John F. Kennedy International Airport. (Neeleman had run a much smaller airline, Morris Air, from Salt Lake before selling it to Southwest in 1993.) New York has been expensive, and Neeleman’s successors have complained about high costs. JetBlue nearly moved to Florida in 2010, but stayed put after winning new incentives from New York. This time, putting the airline in Utah was an easy decision, Johnson said, even though the local airport is not expected to be a focus city, perhaps because it is dominated by Delta Air Lines. “People can be working and living everywhere,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense to be trying to hire in the highest cost of living places. It doesn’t make a ton of sense for a competitive business.” There is, however, one outstanding issue with basing an airline in Utah. There are fewer executives with airline operations experience, so Neeleman’s startup is expected to keep an East Coast base for its operational team.

Follow Us On Twitter,"There's no limit to how wealthy the stock market can make you. Well, maybe the sky. And even THAT is near infinite. Here's what I mean by that … “For a smart guy, you are really stupid sometimes,” my sister said to me once. I don't want to say she's right. But you might agree with her after you hear this story … See, I had booked airline tickets for the four of us — my sister, her 22-year-old son and my youngest son — to Las Vegas. Of course, I picked the cheapest tickets I could find and bought us “basic economy” seats. Stupid me. Basic economy doesn’t allow seat selection and you have to pay extra to check luggage. The result was that three out of the four of us ended up with a dreaded middle seat, and we paid $30 for each piece of checked luggage. Those baggage fees have become BIG business. In 2018, American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) made a respective $1.2 billion and $889 million from baggage fees alone. According to the Department of Transportation, the U.S. airline industry as a whole made $5 billion in baggage fees last year. In just the first quarter of 2019, that dollar amount jumped to $2.1 billion, a 25% year-over-year increase from Q1 2018. Worse yet, now some airlines even charge for carry-on bags! These baggage fees are becoming important profit centers for the airline industry. Particularly in the case of low-cost carriers. Baggage fees alone generated 19%, 16% and 14% of total revenues for the low-cost carriers Spirit (SAVE), Frontier and Allegiant (ALGT), respectively. An average of 2.7 million people fly every day in the U.S. In fact, 45% of Americans took at least one flight in 2018. I can’t think of the last time I had an empty seat next to me. The average load factor (airline-speak for occupancy rates) has increased from 75% in 2005 to an all-time high of 86% last year. You know who really loves the airline industry?

Despite the Wall Street euphoria, it could have been so much sweeter for the Dow, had a significant collapse in Boeing (NYSE: BA), the index’s most heavily weighted stock, not spoiled the party. Unsurprisingly given Boeing’s struggles, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the worst-performing of the three major US stock market indices. Minutes before the closing bell, the Dow had advanced 132.03 points or 0.47% to 28,267.41. The S&P 500 was able to rise 0.8% to 3,194.15, while the Nasdaq was the top performer, up just under 1% to trade at 8,821.3. Despite the significant move higher in equities, risk-on conditions did not hurt the price of gold too much, as XAU/USD fell just 0.05%. Crude oil rose gently – it’s currently up 0.3%. Driving the move in the Dow Jones was further confirmation over the weekend that the much-vaunted trade-deal between the US and China is sufficiently comprehensive and enforceable to justify the stock market’s optimism.   While there is plenty of skepticism surrounding the deal, particularly given that it is not expected to be signed until January, investors are generally pricing stocks for a gradual de-escalation in Trump’s tariff war with","Dec 16, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/dow-climbs-to-fresh-high-despite-boeing-ba-stocks-dramatic-fall/

The Justice Department said late Friday that a federal grand jury has indicted a California chief executive for allegedly concocting a scheme to defraud investors with false claims about a COVID-19 test. That led to millions of dollars in investors losses, the DOJ said. Keith Berman, 67, the CEO of Decision Diagnostics Inc. undefined, was charged with one count of securities fraud and one count of making false statements, the DOJ said. The indictment alleges that, from February through December 2020, Berman falsely claimed Decision Diagnostics had developed a 15-second test to detect COVID-19 using a finger prick's worth of blood. Berman allegedly knew the test was ""merely an idea and not a validated method of accurately detecting COVID-19, much less an actual product ready for manufacture and sale,"" the DOJ said. According to the indictment, Berman wanted to shore up his company's finances and falsely told investors that the Food and Drug Administration was on the verge of approving the company's request for emergency use for the test.

16,Virgin Galactic's Endgame: Air Travel 50% Faster Than Concorde -- and Profitable? | The Motley Fool,"Virgin Galactic's Endgame: Air Travel 50% Faster Than Concorde -- and Profitable?. Company chairman lays out the long-term plan, from","   Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock took off like -- what else? -- a rocket this week, rising nearly 30% in the first three trading days alone. Pundits are attributing the stock's sudden popularity to a widely publicized report out of investment bank Morgan Stanley, which endorsed the stock bright and early Monday morning. In its report, MS predicted that while Virgin Galactic may look like a risky play on space tourism today, in the longer term Virgin has ""a chance to disrupt the multi-trillion-dollar airline"" market by developing a fleet of point-to-point airplanes capable of carrying air travelers through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. Now whatever could have given Morgan Stanley that idea? IMAGE SOURCE: VIRGIN GALACTIC. It turns out Morgan Stanley's insight into Virgin Galactic's long-term plans appears to have come from Virgin Galactic itself. More precisely, from Virgin Galactic board chairman Chamath Palihapitiya, who in an interview at the Phocuswright Conference 2019 in Miami last month laid out his vision for the ""space"" business over the next 20 to 30 years.  You see, carrying tourists to the edge of space in a ""SpaceShipTwo"" spaceplane (SS2), six at a time and at a cost of $250,000 per ticket, is only the start of this story. Virgin Galactic plans to begin these flights sometime next year, the culmination of 17 years of development work and some $1 billion in investment to validate the ""very difficult technical concepts"" involved in flying aircraft at hypersonic speeds and altitudes of 100 kilometers above Earth's surface. Where things get really interesting, though, is after Virgin Galactic proves it can safely conduct tourist operations at that speed and height (SS2 will technically be flying through Earth's thermosphere at twice the height of the stratosphere). You see, there's not a whole lot of technological difference between flying passengers up to that height then bringing them back down to land where they started and flying them up to that height and bringing them down ... somewhere else. Theoretically, at least, space tourism flights at Virgin Galactic could one day evolve into hypersonic commercial travel using the same, or similar, vehicles -- perhaps as soon as just five to 10 years from now. To put this scenario into context, back when Air France was flying its Concorde supersonic jetliner commercially, that aircraft flew at altitudes about twice as high (18 km) as most other commercial","Dec 16, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/16/virgin-galactics-endgame-air-travel-50-faster-than.aspx
