BTC-USD.,"                                                    The largest U.S. airlines saw the value of their shares rise over the summer travel season even though the coronavirus pandemic continued to decimate their businesses. “While we had all hoped travel would resume by this point, demand for air travel has not returned. There is a long road to recovery ahead,” Nicholas Calio, president and CEO of Airlines For America (A4A), told Yahoo Finance. A4A, an airline industry trade group, released its latest update as the air carriers head into the Labor Day holiday weekend. Passenger volume remains dramatically low – 70% below 2019 levels. Looking ahead to the fall, A4A says ticket sales remain “highly depressed” with revenue down 86% year over year, driven largely by the evaporation of business travel. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), North American airlines saw a 94.5% traffic decline in July, a slight improvement from a 97% decline in June, while capacity fell 86.1%. Yet since Memorial Day, shares of Delta (DAL) are up 37%, American (AAL) up 34%, United (UAL) up 43% and Southwest (LUV) up 32% even though they are all trading well below their pre-pandemic highs. A4A says the pandemic downturn will last several more years and passenger volume will not return to 2019 levels until 2024. Calio is calling on Congress and the Trump administration for more financial support. “The reality is that without additional federal aid, U.S. airlines will be forced to make very difficult business decisions,” he said. United Airlines on Wednesday notified more than 16,000 employees they would be laid off Oct. 1 when the first round of support from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act expires. In March, United along with Delta, Southwest, American and other carriers postponed layoffs in exchange for $50 billion in federal grants and loans. American warned last week that it will have to furlough 19,000 employees and Delta warned it could cut 2,000 pilots. Only Southwest Airlines has said it will be able to avoid layoffs through the end of the year.

1,Key Reasons for Airline Stocks' Resilience Despite Challenges,. . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD.,"                                                   It is no longer news that the Airline industry remains one of the worst-hit corners of the investing space amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, despite the existing challenges, shares of heavyweights like American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL, Southwest Airlines LUV and Alaska Air Group ALK have appreciated 14.7%, 21.2%, 14.9%, 23.3% and 16.5%, respectively, over the past month. The Zacks Airline industry also increased 17% in the same time frame. This northward movement in stock prices against the backdrop of coronavirus-led adversity is certainly heartening. Let’s look at the reasons responsible for this uptrend. Improvement in Passenger Demand: Though air-travel demand is still trending way below the year-ago levels, there has been a slight recovery in it (particularly in leisure demand). For instance, Southwest Airlines management recently stated that there was an improvement in demand for August after a lull in July due to the spike in coronavirus cases in certain parts of the United States. Booking trends for September also showed a modest uptick. That Americans are slowly taking to the skies again is reflected in the surging number of passengers screened by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at airports. Notably, TSA screened 807,695 passengers last Sunday (Aug 30), marking a huge increase from the April 14 figure when only 87,534 people were screened. This significant growth bodes well as we head for the Labor Day holiday weekend. The recent updates on cash burn by some carriers are also encouraging. Evidently, Alaska Air expects its cash burn to decline to less than $125 million in August from approximately $175 million in July.

IATA’s Promising July Traffic Report: That the improvement is not only limited to the United States is evident from the International Air Transport Association’s July traffic report. Per the International Air Transport Association, passenger demand in July (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs), though down 79.8% year over year, improved from June levels when the year over year decline was 86.6%. This positivity can be attributed to the impressive performance by the domestic markets of Russia and China.

2,"Airline Stocks: Warren Buffett Deboards, Others Check-In","Airline Stocks: Warren Buffett Deboards, Others Check-In. Warren Buffett. Why did Warren Buffett buy airline stocks?. Retail investors warm up","UPDATED 4 MONTHS AGO On May 2, Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK.B) chairman, Warren Buffett, revealed that he sold all of its airline stocks. Berkshire Hathaway has incurred a loss since airline stocks have fallen sharply this year. The sector is among the worst affected amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on Thursday’s closing prices, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) have fallen by 53%, 63%, 67%, and 74%, respectively, in 2020. Berkshire Hathaway held stakes in all of the above-mentioned airline stocks. Warren Buffett started adding airline stocks in 2016. Previously, he had a very pessimistic view of the sector. He even called the airline sector a “death trap.” Ironically, airline stocks ended up being a death trap for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett sold the airline stocks early based on the standards that he has set. Berkshire Hathaway has held some companies like Coca-Cola and American Express for decades. According to Warren Buffett, the world has changed for airline companies. However, some fund managers have a positive view of the sector. While Warren Buffett has exited airline stocks, retail investors were net buyers in the sector, according to TD Ameritrade. Orascom Investment Holding Chairman and CEO Naguib Sawiris is also bullish on airline stocks. Speaking with CNBC, Sawiris said, “With every crisis there is opportunity,” He also said, “You can go and buy an airline today for $1 if you are assuming the bulk of the debt.” Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly disagrees with Warren Buffett’s view of airline stocks. Even though he’s also pessimistic about the sector, he isn’t as pessimistic as Buffett. Warren Buffett doesn’t buy or sell companies for their short-term outlook. In my view, the airline sector could face long-term pain. Even when economies reopen, it could take a long time for the sector to get back to normal. Also, there’s always a risk that when the pandemic ends, businesses might replace some of their travel with online meetings. Consumers might not feel comfortable with air travel for a long time. Buffett had plenty of advice for retail investors during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting. Read Warren Buffett’s Advice during Berkshire Hathaway’s Meeting to learn more.

3,Why Airline Shares Climbed Higher on Thursday Morning | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Climbed Higher on Thursday Morning. The cruise industry provides a boost of optimism for the travel sector..,"   Airline shares jumped higher at the open Thursday on a hopeful sign of a travel recovery. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) led the way, jumping 7.8%, with JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) gaining 7.3% and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) each up more than 6%. The stocks gave back much of those gains as the morning went on, but each was still in the green as of 11 a.m. EDT, at a time when the broader market was down more than 2%. Airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused travel demand to all but evaporate. Industry watchers are expecting demand to remain sluggish through the early months of 2021 at the least, as it seems unlikely travelers will return until there is a vaccine. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In this environment, investors have tended to react to any glimmer of optimism that suggests a recovery might happen sooner than feared. They got such a glimmer on Thursday as Carnival (NYSE:CCL) (NYSE:CUK) said its Costa Cruises brand will restart operations this weekend. The cruise resumptions are only for Europe, and not the U.S., but given that the cruise industry has been hit just as hard as airlines by the pandemic any effort to normalize is a hopeful sign that we've entered a new phase in the recovery. Spirit and American both operate major hubs in south Florida that are gateways for cruise passengers, and JetBlue also has substantial exposure to Florida and the Caribbean region. United also has a large leisure business, and that stock is likely also still feeling the impact of the airline announcing decisive actions to cut costs and preserve cash to ride out the downturn. Airline shares also got support on Thursday from the advisory firm that runs the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEMKT:JETS) exchange-traded fund. In an investor update the advisors noted that daily Transportation Security Administration screenings hit 807,000 last Sunday, saying that further jumps ""could spur a second big wave of airline equity buying."" All travel reopenings are a step in the right direction, but investors should be careful not to get ahead of themselves. There is nothing to suggest anything but a multi-year downturn for the industry, and even when traffic begins to normalize the airlines will have billions in added debt on their balance sheets that will need to be worked down over time.","Sep 3, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/03/why-airline-shares-climbed-higher-on-thursday-morn/

5,Goldman Sachs Says to Buy 4 Top Airline Stocks for Gains Ahead – 24/7 Wall St.,. . . . . Goldman Sachs Says to Buy 4 Top Airline Stocks for Gains Ahead. Alaska Air. JetBlue,"Money is often made in the stock market when investors have the foresight to make a contrarian bet, and if there was ever one in a pandemic and recession it would be buying airline stocks. While air travel has picked up some since the spring and early summer lock-downs, it is still nowhere near the usual levels. However, the reality is that at some point it will return, and when it does those who had the foresight to buy could be richly rewarded. In a new report from Goldman Sachs, the firm has adjusted its price targets within its coverage universe of the airlines. Some of those targets have come down, but the stocks that have Buy ratings still have big-time upside to the revised targets. Four stocks are rated Buy, and all make sense for long-term investors with patience and a vision of things returning somewhat to normal in 2021. The market has been seeing stronger conviction that at least one of the current COVID-19 vaccines in late-stage studies will be approved, and perhaps during 2020. That alone could contribute to a major recovery in airline traffic. As always, it is important to remember that no single analyst report should ever be used as a sole basis for any buying or selling decisions. This company has a big west coast exposure, and continues to rank high on Wall Street. Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) is the parent company of Alaska Airlines. The company serves more than 100 cities through an expansive network in Alaska, the Lower 48, Hawaii, Canada and Mexico. Despite recent challenges by other carriers for superiority in the Northwest, the company has strong customer loyalty, which had contributed to outstanding earnings and revenue growth. Alaska Air Group has transformed from a largely north-south directional carrier to one with a more balanced network. The analysts noted that the company is experiencing slower-than-expected ramp up of merger synergies, but the greater competitive capacity for markets in development. And much of that can likely be tied to unlucky timing due to COVID-19. The Goldman Sachs price target for the company was slightly lowered to $62 from $63. That is versus a much lower Wall Street consensus target of $44.40. The last trade for Alaska Air Group stock was seen on Thursday at $40.39.

View All. POPULAR. Albert Edwards:","As you may know by now, stocks just had their best August in more than 30 years. The S&P 500 Index gained 7 percent, the most for the eighth calendar month since 1986, around the same time that Gordon Gekko raided corporations in Oliver Stone’s Wall Street. This is highly positive, as it means investors are betting that a possible vaccine for the coronavirus could be made available sooner rather than later. The head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Stephen Hahn, said on Sunday he is willing to authorize a vaccine before Phase Three clinical trials were complete. Tech stocks have been responsible for much of the market’s gains this year, but August saw a new crop of big gainers. Travel stocks—including airlines, cruise lines and hotels—were among the best performing equities during the month as new daily COVID-19 cases have declined in the U.S. from their mid-July highs. The NYSE Arca Airline Index rose an incredible 17.20 percent, its biggest one-month gain since January 2012. click to enlarge Royal Caribbean was the top performer of the bunch at 41 percent, followed by MGM Resorts at 40 percent and Norwegian at 25 percent—all representing industries that have been hardest hit by the pandemic.  The five biggest airlines in the U.S.—Delta, Southwest, American, United and Alaska—saw double-digit growth in August, even as federal aid is soon to run out. However, President Donald Trump said recently that he supports additional assistance to protect airline workers. “We’ll be helping the airlines. You have to help the airlines,” Trump said from the White House Tuesday. What that help might look like is unclear at the moment, but Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows claimed last week that Trump is considering an executive order to bypass Congressional lawmakers, which have still not agreed on a second major coronavirus relief package.

If you were a Northwest shareholder in 2008 and are still holding DAL stock, you made out like a bandit.   If you haven’t sold after 12 years, you probably shouldn’t now, despite the damage the novel coronavirus has inflicted on the airline industry. The merger between the two airlines was valued at $3.4 billion. Northwest shareholders got 1.25 shares of Delta stock for every share they held in the Minneapolis-based airline (Delta’s headquartered in Atlanta).   “We appreciate that stockholders recognize the benefits the Delta-Northwest merger will offer our company, customers, employees, and the communities we serve. This is another milestone toward completing a merger that brings together two unique airlines with complementary strengths that will offer unmatched global service,” said Delta’s CEO at the time, Richard Anderson, said about the merger.  In 2008, Northwest generated $13.6 billion in revenue, which includes two months of sales as part of Delta. Together, the merged entity had $35 billion in sales and 75,000 employees. Further, it is expected to generate $2 billion in revenue synergies and cost savings per year once fully integrated.   “There are global corporations but no global airlines. The race to become the first truly global airline has an incredible reward to it,” Consultant Darryl Jenkins said in October 2008. “The revenue potential is something that we have not seen yet. That’s the synergy that will make this very lucrative.” Once the all-stock merger was completed, Northwest shareholders owned 41%, and Delta shareholders owned the rest.  Now, let’s fast forward to today.  In the middle of the pandemic, Delta shares are off almost 47% in 2020. However, they’ve rebounded nicely in August, up just less than 24% for the month.  In terms of revenues, it generated $47 billion in 2019. Two quarters into fiscal 2020, Delta’s trailing 12-month sales are down to $34.1 billion. This number will likely continue to drop over the next two quarters. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  If you go back to 2009, you will see that the merged company’s revenues fell by 18% from almost $35 billion in combined annual sales in 2008 to $28.1 billion a year later.

No stock goes up in perpetuity. It might be easy to look at the red-hot runs of shares that double and triple in a year or two and think the good times will last forever. But longtime BlackBerry (BB) shareholders likely wish they had taken some off the top after the stock's 500% run in the late aughts. Ask JCPenney and Sears shareholders whether it was worth holding until the bitter end. Yes, Warren Buffett will tell you ""our favorite holding period is forever,"" but just because it's his favorite holding period doesn't mean he lives and dies by buy-and-hold. For every American Express (AXP) that he holds for several decades, there's an American Airlines (AAL) that he ditched in just a few years.

15,Why Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Will Recover From COVID-19 - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Will Recover From COVID-19. The pandemic’s impact,"      Stephanie Bedard-Chateauneuf, MBA | September 4, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) is a stock to own for a COVID-19 recovery. When a good vaccine hits the market, it could make the airline stock take off on the charts. From broad travel restrictions to the deep drop in demand for air travel, the impact of the coronavirus on the travel industry has been unprecedented. The federal government has introduced a new Flight Plan to navigate the pandemic, which outlines best practices and consistent standards for passengers’ health and safety. However, the travel restrictions remain intact, and the federal government shows no signs of easing them. The airline industry has been decimated by the pandemic and related lockdowns and restrictions, and Air Canada is no exception. The stock has been one of the best performing over the past decade, but the carrier’s good fortune has eroded in the economic slump caused by the COVID pandemic. Air Canada is spending money to survive this pandemic. The company lost $1.75 billion in its most recent quarter, as revenue fell 89% to $527 million for its second quarter ended June 30. Air Canada had $9.12 billion in unrestricted liquidity at the end of last month, giving it plenty of time and space to get back on its feet. At the same time, the credit rating agency Fitch downgraded Air Canada from BB to negative BB, with Fitch saying the airline will experience a slower-than-expected recovery in 2021. Air Canada said it carried less than 4% of the passengers it had in the second quarter of last year. CEO Calin Rovinescu called the combined impact of COVID-19 and the restrictions federal and inter-provincial governments of Canada “devastating and unprecedented.” The airline laid off more than 50% of its staff, or nearly 20,000 employees, in its devastating fiscal second quarter of 2020. The pandemic has hit Air Canada shares like other airlines. From $52 per share at the start of the year, Air Canada stock dropped to $12.

16,Can Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Continue its Rally? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Can Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Continue its Rally?. Why Air Canada stock,"      Kay Ng | September 3, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock just appreciated close to 23% in the last month. However, this is only the beginning of a long (but volatile) climb up.  AC data by YCharts. The economic-sensitive stock is trading at a cyclical low. Since the March market crash, Air Canada stock has been consolidating in the range of roughly $12.50 and $22.50. At about $18 per share at writing, the airline stock has a long way to recovery. Before we get too excited about the past month’s rally, let’s review why the stock is down so much in the first place. The COVID-19 pandemic alongside government-imposed restrictions on air travel to minimize the spread of the virus pretty much wiped out the demand for air travel with Air Canada. This resulted in a whopping drop of 89% in Air Canada’s revenue in the second quarter versus Q2 2019, which was piggybacked with an operating loss of more than $1.5 billion for the quarter. The company’s results in the first half of the year (H1) show a bigger picture of the pandemic impacts. Revenue dropped 54% to $4.2 billion against H1 2019. Losses were softened by a substantial reduction in operating expenses by about 28%. Accordingly, the stock is trading about 59% lower than a year ago.  AC data by YCharts. Air Canada has the financial strength to stay afloat for more than a year. Its current and quick ratios are 1.2 times and 1.1 times, respectively, which have improved from 0.9 times and 0.8 times a year ago. The company was able to increase its liquidity to $9.1 billion as of the end of Q2. Along with its cost-cutting measures, including permanently retiring 30% of its fleet, the company can survive more than 1.5 years based on its projected Q3 cash burn levels of about $1.5 billion. As restrictions ease and air travel demand increases, the cash burn will diminish, and the deadline will extend. Airline stocks like Air Canada outperform in a growing economy. If you believe the economy will grow over the next five years and you have that long an investment horizon, you can go for a position in Air Canada stock. It’s more likely that the stock will rally higher before the economy and air travel outlook is much brighter.

The major indexes regained some ground in late afternoon though trading was still volatile. At its lowest point of the day the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell as much as 9.9% from its record high reached on Wednesday and the S&P 500 dipped briefly below its pre-crisis record, reached in February, although it too closed well off session lows. Mega-cap companies such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc also pared losses though of that group only Apple managed a very tiny gain for the day. “You had a significant sell-off on Thursday, some follow-through in the morning and then we stabilized. The selling was pretty fierce,” said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “Corrections like this have been quick and severe lately. We don’t know if its over,” he said. “The fact we stabilized today could be a good sign.” While Thursday’s sell-off already reflected investor fears that valuations for the Nasdaq high-flyers had overheated, the worries were exacerbated on Friday by the Financial Times (FT) and others reporting that options trading by Japan’s Softbank had inflated these stocks. “We’ve started to see signs of weakness in the last few days, notably yesterday. Then you get a headline like the FT story. That really adds fuel to the fire on the downside,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston. The Nasdaq had powered the stock market’s stellar recovery from the coronavirus-led crash, climbing as much as 82% from March lows. The benchmark S&P 500 and Dow had surged about 60% from their troughs. Earlier on Friday, the Labor Department’s closely watched employment report showed the jobless rate improved to 8.4% from 10.2% in July, better than analysts had anticipated. Nonfarm payrolls, however, increased less than expected last month. Kleintop argued that the jobs","Sep 4, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-idUSL1N2G11V2
