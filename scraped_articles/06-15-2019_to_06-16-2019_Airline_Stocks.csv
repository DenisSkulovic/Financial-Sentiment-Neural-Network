1,Unsystematic Risk,Unsystematic Risk. What Is Unsystematic Risk?. Unsystematic Risk. Understanding Unsystematic Risk. KEY TAKEAWAYS. Company-Specific Risk. Example of Unsystematic Risk. Compete,"Unsystematic risk is unique to a specific company or industry. Also known as “nonsystematic risk,” ""specific risk,"" ""diversifiable risk"" or ""residual risk,"" in the context of an investment portfolio, unsystematic risk can be reduced through diversification. This can be contrasted with systematic risk, which is inherent in the market. Unsystematic risk can be described as the uncertainty inherent in a company or industry investment. Types of unsystematic risk include a new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take significant market share from the company invested in, a regulatory change (which could drive down company sales), a shift in management, and/or a product recall. While investors may be able to anticipate some sources of unsystematic risk, it is impossible to be aware all or when/how these might occur. For example, an investor in healthcare stocks may be aware that a major shift in health policy is on the horizon, yet she/he cannot know in advance the particulars of the new laws and how companies and consumers will respond. The gradual adoption and then potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act, first written into law in 2010, has made it very challenging for some investors in healthcare stocks to anticipate and place confident bets on the direction of the industry and/or specific companies. Examples include things, such as strikes, outcomes of legal proceedings, or natural disasters. This risk is also known as diversifiable risk, since it can be eliminated by sufficiently diversifying a portfolio. There isn't a formula for calculating unsystematic risk; instead, it must be extrapolated by subtracting the systematic risk from the total risk. Two factors cause company-specific risk: Operational risks can result from unforeseen and/or negligent events such as a breakdown in the supply chain or a critical error being overlooked in the manufacturing process. A security breach could expose confidential information about customers or other types of key proprietary data to criminals.  A strategic risk may occur if a business gets stuck selling goods or services in a dying industry without a solid plan to evolve the company's offerings. A company may also encounter this risk by entering into a flawed partnership with another firm or competitor that hurts their future prospects for growth. Legal and regulatory risks can expose a company to a myriad of liabilities and potential lawsuits from customers, suppliers and competing firms.

2,"Here's What You Should Know About International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A.'s (LON:IAG) 6.4% Dividend Yield - Simply Wall St News","Here's What You Should Know About International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A.'s (LON:IAG) 6.4% Dividend Yield. Payout ratios. Dividend Volatility. Dividend","Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card! Today we'll take a closer look at International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (LON:IAG) from a dividend investor's perspective. Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments. With a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if International Consolidated Airlines Group is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. We'd agree the yield does look enticing. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 4.9% of market capitalisation this year. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis Companies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, International Consolidated Airlines Group paid out 28% of its profit as dividends. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend. In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. International Consolidated Airlines Group paid out 133% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out such a high percentage of cash flow suggests that the dividend was funded from either cash at bank or by borrowing, neither of which is desirable over the long term. International Consolidated Airlines Group paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were International Consolidated Airlines Group to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.

4,United Airlines Rolls Out a New Tool to Prevent Missed Connections | The Motley Fool,United Airlines Rolls Out a New Tool to Prevent Missed Connections. The airline has some spiffy new technology that could,"   For air travelers, one of the most inconvenient experiences possible is to miss a connecting flight. Not only will you not get to your destination on time, but you could be stranded in an unfamiliar city for an indefinite period of time. Airline giant United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL) wants to help its customers avoid the hassle of missed connections. Earlier this week, United announced it is deploying a new technology tool that it calls ""ConnectionSaver,"" which will help reduce the number of missed connections by automatically holding certain flights until connecting passengers arrive. Obviously, the best way for airlines to avoid having customers miss their connections is to keep their flights running on time in the first place. However, that's easier said than done. Factors outside of airlines' control like weather and airport congestion can cause significant delays. In recent years, about 80% of U.S. commercial flights have arrived no more than 14 minutes later than scheduled. (Those flights are considered ""on time"" for the purpose of official government statistics.) United's on-time performance for mainline flights has been right around the average, which isn't bad considering that the airline has lots of flights at congested airports. A 90% on-time arrival rate is virtually unheard of among U.S. airlines. Thus, delays are an inevitable part of the business. UNITED AIRLINES' ON-TIME PERFORMANCE TENDS TO BE ROUGHLY AVERAGE. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. Given that some flights are bound to arrive late, airlines have a few options for dealing with the possibility of missed connections. First, airlines could extend their minimum connection times, creating a buffer in case the first flight arrives late. But that would increase travelers' journey times to avoid a relatively infrequent issue (i.e., missed connections), potentially leading to market share losses. Second, airlines can hold planes at their hubs to wait for connecting passengers. However, that risks inconveniencing lots of customers for the benefit of a few. It can also cause cascading delays, as one late-arriving aircraft causes several others to be delayed. The third option is to stick to the schedule as much as possible, recognizing that some customers will miss their connecting flights as a result. That can lead to customer complaints, though, particularly from those who miss their connecting flights by just minutes. In other words, airlines are stuck with a delicate balancing act when deciding whether to hold a flight for late-arriving connecting","Jun 16, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/16/united-airlines-new-tool-prevent-missed-connection.aspx

F1 agrees 2021 rules delay as Hamilton joins summit Why teams are at loggerheads over F1's revolution But while Wolff is in favour of a number of tweaks that are coming – including a budget cap – he suggests that expecting new chassis regulations to stop the top teams being at the front is wrong. Asked by Motorsport.com for his feelings on the impact of a major rules change, Wolff said: ""The default reaction in the past when a team or the big three teams were running away with the championship is that we change the regulations, because you believe that by changing the regulations the others may catch up. ""I think it's exactly the opposite, which is counter intuitive, that eventually performance converges. We have seen that with the power unit regulations that have been stable for a while, and I think if we left the chassis regulations alone more teams would be closer together. ""But as in the past, teams lobby for change because they believe rolling the dice can be an advantage for them. But we look at the 2019 regulation and the 2018 regulations and none of that has happened. ""The teams that were in front, they increased the gaps they had, so we are back to square one. We are making that mistake over and over again."" Wolff said that history has shown time and again that some of the best eras of F1 have been when the rules have been left along for a while. ""There is one single key that makes the racing better and that is a field that is bunched up, where there is not a big gap between the top teams and the smaller teams,"" he explained. ""The only way of doing that is leave the rules alone. ""Every time you change the regs, the big teams with more resource will run away.

7,When Will Boeing 737 Max Fly Again and More Questions: QuickTake - Bloomberg,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"Two crashes within five months -- Lion Air Flight 610 in October 2018 off the coast of Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March outside Addis Ababa -- killed 346 people and led to a global grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max jets, the fourth generation of a venerable brand first flown in 1967. Uncertainty over when it will fly again is rippling through the airline industry and Boeing’s finances. The U.S. manufacturer’s bill is $9.2 billion and rising, as it faces questions about the plane’s development and its own transparency. Personnel shakeups have reached all the way to the top. Unclear. Boeing had hoped the single-aisle plane would be back in service by the end of 2019, but that clearly didn’t happen. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration must first certify redesigned flight-control software that’s supposed to address the cause of the two crashes. Regulators also must sign off on updated training material for pilots. In a stunning reversal after less-than-stellar test results, Boeing is now recommending airlines put pilots through simulator training before they fly the 737 Max. It also will take time for airlines to ready stored jets for service and work them back into flight schedules.

Dividend aristocrats.,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | June 16, 2019 | More on: BNS TD BNS TD The top Canadian banks are the epitome of financial stability and dependability. All of them survived the last financial crisis and passed the recession test with flying colours. In particular, Toronto Dominion Bank (TSX:TD)(NYSE:TD) and Bank of Nova Scotia (TSX:BNS)(NYSE:BNS) exhibited extraordinary resiliency. If you want to invest in Canadian banks, the two banks should be top of mind. These are “buy-and-hold” stocks that offer financial security well into the future. Canadian bank stocks are the core holdings of many long-term investors. Assessing which stock to buy at this time is stimulating. There’s a thin line separating TD and Scotiabank. Both are blue chip stocks that are reasonably priced relative to their market capitalizations. We advise investors to look for blue chip companies that are likely to pay off if business and the stock market are good, but that won’t hurt them too much during those inevitable periods when business or the markets are bad. In my book, Toronto Dominion is one of three Canadian blue chip stocks I’m never going to sell. If the banking sector and the stock market are doing well, then I’m good. But when the market is falling or during inevitable periods of uncertainties, my investment is protected. Despite the low interest rate scenario, the bank’s income climbed by 8.33% to $11.2 billion. Since 2015, profits are on the rise and growth estimate next year is 8.8%. The total assets of Canada’s second-largest bank by market capitalization to-date are $1.3 trillion. Based on my recent ranking of the Top 3 Canadian banks, Scotiabank is a close third to second-ranked Toronto Dominion.  The 187-year old bank has a long history of strong operating results. Net earnings are just as strong and have averaged $8.25 billion in the last two years. The growth estimate for 2020 is 7.7%. Scotiabank is the most appealing bank stock because of the high 5.0% dividend yield. Toronto Dominion pays a lower dividend of 4.0%, although the payout ratio of 44.35% is lower compared to Scotiabank’s 50.60%. The two banks are regarded as “Dividend Aristocrats” so investors won’t feel skittish about a recession, trade war or any other market disruptions. The dividend growth rates are practically identical at 8.0%. They are the real inducements to income investors.

The national carrier","With significant drop in overseas capacity due to Jet Airways’ grounding, national carrier Air India plans to expand its network by adding destinations like Nairobi, Hong Kong and Bali. Senior airline officials told FE that operations would commence on these routes by October. The national carrier has already bagged unused flying rights of grounded Jet Airways to cities like Dubai, Doha and London. Air India increased frequencies on Delhi-Dubai and Mumbai-Dubai routes from June 1. Air India is looking to take advantage of the massive drop in capacity on overseas routes due to Jet’s grounding on April 17. International capacity, measured in terms of available seat kilometres, for Indian carriers was down 17% year-on-year in April due to closure of Jet, as per the Directorate  General of Civil Aviation. Around 70% of Air India’s revenue come from international operations. As per travel firm Cleartrip, average fares during April and May were higher by up to 30 % y-o-y on major routes to Dubai, Singapore, London and Thailand.

While budget airline IndiGo recently announced direct flights to Hong Kong from Kolkata, SpiceJet also plans to introduce services to the east Asian territory. Nairobi in Kenya and Indonesia’s Bali would be new destinations for Air India. The airline is likely to connect Chennai with the Bali island. Since Jet’s closure, Air India is now the largest carrier on overseas routes. However, it is grappling with lack of funds, forcing several of its aircraft to remain on the ground. The airline currently has 14 aircraft on ground (AoG) awaiting replacement of engines and their spare parts, which it hopes to make airborne by October this year. “AoGs have come down to 14 after four aircraft, including Boeing 777s, rejoined the fleet in the last two months. We have made plans to resolve the engine issues by October,” an airline executive said. It has a fleet of 128 aircraft, including 49 wide-body planes, of which Boeing 777 and Boeing 787s are a part.

It was the beginning of a four-day earthquake in equities. The stock market crash ripped the bottom out of the economy and catalyzed the Great Depression. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 25% in value during that crash. Therefore Trump is predicting if a Democrat is elected in 2020, the Dow could lose even more than 25% of its value. In other words, at today’s benchmark around 26,000, Trump foresees the Dow potentially below 20,000 in this blue wave scenario. Donald Trump will commence his 2020 reelection campaign this Tuesday.

By CCN.com: Despite the performance of Tesla’s stock this year, there’s no shortage of TSLA bulls. Even though the stock has lost around 25% of its market cap year-to-date, Alexander Haissl of Berenberg told CNBC he is looking for a price target of $500. The stock is currently hovering at $214. “We maintain our bullish view on Tesla and see no reason to walk away from our price target of $500. Demand worries are overblown, as the Q1 volume weakness was largely self-inflicted by logistic problems, uncertainty about store closures and changing pricing structure, and not indicative of the underlying demand situation.” It was just over a week ago when we were talking about Tesla being down around 40% on the year. A couple of clear factors have helped lift the stock price approximately 15%. First, brighter sentiment has lifted TLSA on the tide of the broader markets. Secondly, oversold shares are in demand for bulls looking to bargain hunt the dip. Aside from these short-term factors, fundamentals are also looking good.   Model 3 sales have picked up recently, affirming bulls like Haissl to maintain confidence that there is massive upside in Tesla’s stock. Car manufacturers typically operate on razor-thin margins, and Tesla is no different. The mass-produced Model 3 is Elon Musk’s biggest scaling play and is vital to help grow the company so it can be profitable.

Sri Lanka,"ECONOMYNEXT – State-run SriLankan Airlines has defaulted on loans which have been backed by government, a Finance Ministry report has said. ""The Government bears contingent liabilities over the provision of guarantees for loans obtained from People’s Bank and Bank of Ceylon as well as Sovereign Guarantee issued for the International Bond,"" the report said. ""These have become obvious liabilities for the government…"" The report said SriLankan was unable to repay some installments with internally generated funds. SriLankan has been making new borrowings to cover losses and the tax payer has also injected some funds since ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa terminated a managing shareholder deal with Emirates. SriLankan has a 175 million US dollar international bond guaranteed by the government which falls due on June 2019. In 2018, long term loans went up from 26 billion rupees to 43.5 billion rupees. SriLankan has also borrowed US dollar and rupee loans from state-run Bank of Ceylon, People’s Bank on Treaury letters of comfort. There also also loans from private banks taken against reciepts and assets. A restructuring attempt of the airline with the help of an international consultant failed, with the airline accumulating more losses, the Treasury said. ""SLA has lost some of the valuable parking slots and routes which used to give indirect economic benefits by this attempt.""        The Treasury said that a ‘severe restructuring’ of the airline is required, and that proposals made by an expert committee appointed by the President should be implemented immediately. Airline de-regulation worldwide has allowed privately owned airlines to grow, and state-run airlines are not able compete effectively.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV), may trade at a discount or premium to NAV and are not individually redeemed from the funds. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Because the funds concentrate their investments in specific industries, the funds may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries. The funds are non-diversified, meaning they may concentrate more of their assets in a smaller number of issuers than diversified funds. The funds invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The funds may invest in the securities of smaller-capitalization companies, which may be more volatile than funds that invest in larger, more established companies. The performance of the funds may diverge from that of the index.","Jun 16, 2019",https://www.usglobaletfs.com/news-archive/etf-spotlight-airline-etf-jets-rallied/
