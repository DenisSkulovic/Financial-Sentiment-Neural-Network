But Covid-19 has rebounded with a fury into August. Fresh outbreaks across the region have left popular destinations, like Spain, almost complete no-fly zones due to outside quarantine requirements on travelers. Summer...

3,New turbulence for airlines - Axios,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"                 Illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios The peak leisure travel season — such as it is — is almost over, and without conferences or events to woo business travelers this fall, the airline industry's modest recovery could quickly lose altitude. Why it matters: Investors have been snapping up airlines as bargain stocks lately — encouraged, in part, by reports of potential progress toward a coronavirus vaccine that could boost depressed air travel. Investors seem to be betting that furloughs and other deep cost cuts — and perhaps another round of federal aid — will put airlines in decent shape for a financial recovery when travel picks up again. What's happening: The re-opening trade has been popular since the start of August. Hotels like Marriott and Hyatt have each gained 12%. Airline stocks represented by the JETS ETF are up 9%, and MGM Resorts surged 30%. What they're saying: ""Companies now sit at a lean and mean position that you rarely get to, except after a depression,"" Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, tells Axios. Yes, but: Short sellers — investors who bet that companies' stocks are overpriced and profit when they fall — are lining up to bet against the airlines, with $95 million of new short sales over the last week, according to data firm S3 Partners. For the record: the airline industry was on its way to another year of record operating revenues in 2020 when COVID-19 shut everything down in mid-March. By the numbers: According to the trade group's data: Quarantine restrictions have had a big effect on travel to some regions: Flights to New York and New Jersey have dropped the most, because of New York's clampdown on travelers from states with high infection rates. Travel to Hawaii, which has similar restrictions, is almost non-existent, with passenger counts down 94% year over year. Almost all of those who are flying are leisure travelers — people visiting friends and family, or taking domestic vacations after being cooped up all spring. Bank of America analysts are sounding a note of caution: ""We are only a few weeks away from moving out of peak leisure travel season, and into a more business-heavy period. With corporate volumes not moving meaningfully off of trough levels, we believe there could be risk to domestic volumes","Aug 21, 2020",https://www.axios.com/new-turbulence-for-airlines-a8426184-6655-4199-a5d3-6678cbb9b20f.html
4,MARKET REPORT: Airline stocks take off with Portugal boost | This is Money,. MARKET REPORT: Airline stocks take off after Portugal is added to UK's list of safe holiday destinations. RELATED ARTICLES.,"By MATT OLIVER FOR THE DAILY MAIL PUBLISHED: 21:51 GMT, 21 August 2020 | UPDATED: 11:56 GMT, 22 August 2020  4 View
comments  Airline stocks took off yesterday after Portugal was added to the UK's list of safe holiday destinations.  Ministers said travellers returning from the country will no longer have to go into quarantine from Saturday, prompting a huge surge in bookings.  Portugal is a firm favourite of sun-seekers, with some 1.8m Britons visiting per year.   The easing of restrictions offered welcome relief to embattled airlines, which have seen passenger numbers hammered by global travel restrictions.  Easyjet was up 3.5 per cent, or 19.4p, to 573.8p, while rival budget carrier Ryanair rose 2.9 per cent, or €0.32, to €11.45. Tui also rose 4.8 per cent, or 14p, to 308.2p, Wizz Air by 1,5 per cent, or 52p, to 3614p and British Airways owner IAG by 1.4 per cent, or 2.7p, to 193.2p. Dart Group, the owner of Jet2, rose 2.2 per cent, or 14.5p, to 676.5p.  Jet2 boss Steve Heapy said: 'We welcome this change in government advice which means that customers can once again look forward to enjoying their well deserved holidays in the stunning Algarve region.'  It was despite Austria, Croatia and Trinidad and Tobago joining the quarantine list, triggering a rush of holidaymakers trying to get home before the restrictions kick in.  Amid the airlines' cheer, however, the FTSE100 dipped into the red. Shares were knocked back despite upbeat data showing the economic recovery from the coronavirus is gathering pace.  A rapid survey by IHS Markit and CIPS found that British industry has this month reported its fastest growth in almost seven years, after the easing of lockdown restrictions. The UK's purchasing managers' index (PMI) of economic activity – where scores below 50 show decline and above show growth – gave a reading of 60.3 for August, beating predictions of 57.1 and up from July's 57.  It was also better than the eurozone reading, which fell from 54.9 to 51.6 and dented hopes of a Vshaped recovery on the Continent.  The boost to UK output was credited to a jump in consumer spending that followed the reopening of large parts of the economy, as people increasingly took 'staycations', ate out and visited shops more often.  But the positive news failed to lift the","Aug 21, 2020",https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-8651923/MARKET-REPORT-Airline-stocks-Portugal-boost.html

AAL, Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. UAL and Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK. Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1043877/airline-industrys-near-term-outlook-drab-due-to-coronavirus-woes The Zacks Airline industry houses companies engaged in the transport of passengers and cargoes to various destinations across the globe. Most operators maintain a fleet comprising multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. They operate with the help of their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers. The industry participants make use of their respective cargo divisions for providing a wide range of freight and mail services. The space includes legacy carriers like American Airlines, low-cost players, such as Southwest Airlines and regional operators, namely SkyWest. Within the low-cost segment, there are ultra low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines. Let’s take a look at the industry’s three major themes: The Airline industry has been one of the worst-hit corners in the investing space due to the coronavirus pandemic that diminished passenger revenues. In fact, woes related to this deadly health peril had a much more severe impact on the recently released airlines’ second-quarter 2020 results than on the March-quarter earnings release. This was because the entire three-month period (April to June) bore the brunt of the meltdown in air-travel demand compared to only one month (March) in the last reported quarter. Due to shrinking top lines, heavyweight airlines including Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines incurred losses in the June quarter. The million-dollar question after such a disappointing performance is whether the airline stocks can turn things around in their favor. The answer is unfortunately an emphatic no, at least in the remainder of the year. The spike in the coronavirus cases in some parts of the United States offset the improvement in air-travel demand witnessed since late May. For example, Southwest Airlines expects operating revenues for August to plunge 70-80% year over year as bookings decreased while trip cancellations increased.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   Investors in American Airlines Group Inc. AAL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 18, 2020 $10.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for American Airlines shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, American Airlines is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Transportation - Airline industry that ranks in the Bottom 5% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while eight have dropped their estimates. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of $3.89 per share to a loss of $5.66 in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about American Airlines right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

A second wave of the coronavirus is likely"," Since the pandemic began, I’ve been bullish on U.S. airline equities, including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), as I predicted that demand for flights in the U.S. this summer would far surpass the Street’s average estimates, but as summer starts to wind down it’s unclear that AAL stock is still a buy.  My first call turned out to be a pretty good one, as airlines’ ticket sales from May until August did indeed come in well above the expectations that most pundits and analysts had in March and April. As a result, most of those who followed my bullish calls on AAL stock and other airlines made money, even if they did not make a proverbial “killing.” But heading into autumn, I’m turning bearish on the airline stocks. That’s largely, though not only, because I continue to believe that weather remains a huge factor in the spread of the coronavirus. I continue to believe that the weather tremendously impacts the spread of the coronavirus. If I’m correct, AAL stock and its peers probably won’t perform very well in October and, possibly,  November. Early on during the pandemic, I noted that Professor John Nicholls of the University of Hong Kong’s Department of Pathology had said that sunlight and humidity undermine the coronavirus. Some people are now saying that Nicholls was wrong because the virus has spread quickly across parts of America’s Sunbelt this summer. But I think that those who theorize that the virus spread across the Sunbelt because people there stay indoors a great deal during the summer are on the right track. More specifically, however, I believe that the combination of staying indoors often and the powerful air conditioning that the region uses have been the primary reason for its problems with the virus this summer. (Having said that, though, the opening of bars and the lack of the use of face masks in some areas likely also contributed to the virus’ spread). YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  At least one expert says that air conditioning could potentially spread the virus. Moreover, in parts of the U.S. where air conditioning is generally less strong, the spread of the coronavirus has eased greatly this summer. And finally, hot countries that use much less AC have done much better than America’s Sunbelt and than other, cooler nations; Morocco has 1,200 cases per 1 million,","Aug 21, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/its-time-to-sell-aal-stock/

American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) has been among those that have been seeking voluntary employee buyouts and planning for potential layoffs come October.  American has now also detailed service reductions it will impose beginning Oct. 7. The airline announced today that it will suspend service to 15 small markets until at least Nov. 3, once the CARES Act commitment expires.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Cities on the list include Greenville, North Carolina; New Haven, Connecticut; and Williamsport, Pennsylvania. And this list may be just the beginning of changes. The company said, ""This is the first step as American continues to evaluate its network and plans for additional schedule changes in the coming weeks."" Airlines have been struggling to cut costs and slow cash burn as the coronavirus pandemic continues to limit customer travel. American had said it was going through $100 million per day in April. By the end of June, that cash burn was down to $40 million per day. It said it plans to be at a zero cash burn rate by the end of 2020.  Modifying flight schedules to more closely follow demand and the announced suspension of service to these markets are ways to minimize losses. The company noted that an extension of the Payroll Support Program is under deliberation, and said it will reassess plans as needed depending on the outcome.

Here’s the,"      Ryan Vanzo | August 21, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock can make you a millionaire. From 2012 to 2019, shares rose 50 times in value. A $20,000 bet would have become $1 million. The coronavirus ruined everything. In early 2020, passenger traffic fell off a cliff. Airlines around the world cut capacity by nearly 100%. Planes were flying empty. For a while, investors thought that business travel would bail the industry out. Those hopes turned out to be baseless. Airline stocks are now more than 70% off their highs. Several operators have already gone bankrupt. Air Canada shares have not been spared. At the start of 2020, the stock traded at $50. Shares are now priced at $16. If the airline industry recovers, AC stock would rise nearly 400%. There may be even more upside considering the company can take additional market share from its struggling competitors. Is this another opportunity to make $1 million by investing in Air Canada stock? When the pandemic first hit, Warren Buffett was unfazed. That was telling considering he was a leading shareholder of four different airlines. “I won’t be selling airline stocks,” he said in March. “Well, it’s going to be terrible. I’ve always felt a pandemic would happen at some time,” Buffett added. But in the end, he didn’t believe the pandemic would “stop the progress of the country or the world.” At the time, Air Canada stock traded at $25 — 70% higher than current levels. If you trusted Buffett and held on to your shares, you would have been disappointed. Two months later, Buffett abandoned the entire industry, selling 100% of his airline stakes. His opinions had changed dramatically. “The airline business — and I may be wrong and I hope I’m wrong — but I think it’s changed in a very major way,” Buffett warned. “The future is much less clear to me.” This is the issue that plagues the industry today: a lack of visibility. Air Canada executives say it could be three years before traffic returns to normal. Manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing anticipate a five-year time frame. Other airlines think demand will be permanently smaller. No one knows the future. Is the lack of visibility creating opportunity? Let’s do the math. Last quarter, Air Canada lost more than $1 billion. The previous quarter, losses also totaled","Aug 21, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/21/air-canada-tsxac-stock-your-chance-to-make-1-million/

LATEST FOREX,"It has certainly been a tough year for the airline industry – and its investors – as the once-profitable sector continues to be one of the hardest hit by the novel coronavirus. Shares ended Wednesday marginally higher as investors remain hopeful that a COVID-19 vaccine will be the key to re-opening both domestic and international travel again. While the stock price is off of its 52-week lows of $8.25 – shares are still down over 60% from the 52-week highs of $31.67 per share.  As of September 30th the Federal Grants via the CARES Act that was helping to offset some of the burdens that the airline industry was facing throughout the ongoing pandemic. American Airlines announced their second-quarter earnings at the end of July and even with the Government aid the results were abysmal. It equated to a loss of $7.82 per share for the quarter compared to earnings of $1.82 per share the year before. Revenues were nearly 85% lower than the $12 billion the company made in the second quarter of 2019. With no end to the coronavirus at sight, a return to normalcy for the travel industry seems nearly impossible in the near future.   While bargain hunting investors may see the current price of AAL’s stock and wonder if it is a good entry point – there should still be some painful days ahead. The TSA recently reported that air travel was down over 75% from this time last year, generally the peak of high travel season. American Airlines has also announced that it is being forced to cancel flights for two-dozen small to medium cities around the U.S. for the foreseeable future.

NEWS IN PHOTOS: ""I Team"""," 24     by PARKER GAVIGAN, NBC 10 NEWS The president and CEO of the Rhode Island Airport Corporation denied knowing more than the average person when he bought airline stocks five months ago at the beginning of the pandemic. During a taping of ""10 News Conference"" on Friday, Iftikhar Ahmad answered questions directly for the first time about those stock purchases on March 24, when according to disclosures filed with the Rhode Island Ethics Commission, he bought stock in four airlines: Jet Blue, United, Delta, and Air Canada. He also bought the stock of tech company IGT and Hertz Rental Car on the same day for a minimum of $30,000. The NBC 10 I-Team first reported on the transactions earlier this month. At the time, Ahmad did not agree to an interview with an I-Team reporter. However, on Friday, he was asked by moderator Gene Valicenti if he had any inside knowledge before the purchases. ""No, I did not,"" replied Ahmad. At the time of the transactions, the economy was tumbling. Airlines were canceling flights.  Many industries quickly lobbied Congress for help, including the American Association of Airline Executives. Ahmad is a member of that executive team. The massive coronavirus relief package included $10 billion to help airports function. The CARES Act passed the Senate on March 25. The day before its passage, Ahmad bought those stocks. ""The timeline is exceptionally suspicious, and I believe we need a full investigation,"" state Sen. Sam Bell, D-Providence, told the I-Team two weeks ago. On ""10 News Conference,"" Ahmad defended the purchases. ""The American Association of Airport Executives is an organization that lobbies for airports, it does not lobby for airlines, and that was the basic misunderstanding,"" he said. While that is true, the airlines were also bailed out in the CARES Act legislation by receiving up to $25 billion in liquidity. ""Why did you buy the stock, just because that's your area of expertise, you felt it was going to go up, why did you?"" asked Valicenti. ""I think people buy what they know. There were other airlines that I had bought and I had sold, and I think that's just that,"" answered Ahmad. None of Ahmad's earlier ethics disclosures list any stock purchases during his nearly four year tenure with RIAC.

19,Coronavirus travel: American Airlines halting service to 15 small cities after federal aid runs out,American Airlines halting service to 15 small cities after federal aid runs out in October. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"American Airlines said Thursday it plans to suspend service to 15 small U.S. cities with low demand in October after the terms of federal aid requiring the flights expires, a move that would cut off scheduled flights to nine destinations in as many states. American and the other U.S. passenger carriers that accepted portions of $25 billion in federal payroll support were required to maintain minimum levels of service through Sept. 30. American is currently the only carrier offering scheduled service to nine of the airports where it plans to suspend flights. They are:  Del Rio, Texas; Dubuque, Iowa; Florence, South Carolina; Greenville, North Carolina; Joplin, Missouri; New Haven, Connecticut; Roswell, New Mexico; Stillwater, Oklahoma and Williamsport, Pennsylvania. American also plans to suspend flights to these airports: Sioux City, Iowa; Kalamazoo/Battle Creek, Michigan; Huntington, West Virginia, New Windsor, New York, Springfield, Illinois;  Lake Charles, Louisiana.  American said it advised the affected airports before its Thursday announcement. “We really had no inkling or forewarning that this was ever in consideration,” said Steve Stockam, manager of the Joplin Regional Airport. “It’s obviously a huge impact for our community because American is the only airline here,” Stockam said. Stockam said he was hopeful that the flights would be restored before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays so locals can “get to where they need to go.” Airline labor unions and executives from carriers including American have urged lawmakers to provide another $25 billion in payroll grants and loans to airlines. While the initiative has gained bipartisan support in Congress, lawmakers have failed to reach a deal for another national coronavirus aid package that could include the additional airline aid. That aid package was meant to help preserve airline employee jobs and prohibited layoffs until Oct. 1. But demand has only recovered to less than a third of normal summer volumes and airlines have warned more than 75,000 employees that their jobs are at risk when the aid terms expire. American had been preparing to cut service to as many as 30 cities, CNBC first reported last week. The cuts take effect on Oct. 7 through Nov. 3. The airports were selected because they have attracted little demand and aren’t likely to rebound in the near term, according to a person familiar with the matter. Air travel demand has plunged because of the pandemic as concerns about the virus and travel restrictions","Aug 20, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/20/coronavirus-travel-american-airlines-halting-service-to-15-small-cities-after-federal-aid-runs-out.html
