0,Why Airline Stocks Are Sinking (Again) on Thursday | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Stocks Are Sinking (Again) on Thursday. What went up just came back down.. What happened. So what. Now,"   Investors curbed their enthusiasm over airline stocks Thursday, after Wednesday's coronavirus vaccine-inspired monster run-up in such shares. In trading yesterday, shares of United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) soared more than 14% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) gained 16%. Discount airline Spirit (NYSE:SAVE) notched a 12% gain, and even Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) -- burdened by bad news earlier in the week -- closed 9.5% higher. Today, though, what went up is coming back down. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In early trading Thursday, circa 11:11 a.m. EDT, United is giving back 3.9% and Spirit 4.7%. Delta's down 5.1%, and American stock -- the biggest winner yesterday -- is leading the industry lower with a 5.9% loss. Why? In part at least (perhaps a large part), I see this as investors locking in profits in a topsy-turvy market for airline stocks. Few industries have been as volatile as airlines throughout the coronavirus pandemic, as investors scatter in fear of bankruptcy concerns one day, only to coalesce and buy back shares hand over fist on any news that might suggest a ""return to normal"" is imminent. Yesterday was one of those latter kinds of days, with vaccine maker Moderna announcing optimistic results from trials of its new coronavirus vaccine. The observation that ""100% of evaluated participants"" in the trial produced ""neutralizing antibodies"" in response to Moderna's vaccine sounded especially propitious. Today, however, we're moving in the opposite direction. For one thing, investors may be selling shares to lock in yesterday's windfall profits, on the (historically sound) assumption that the stocks will get cheaper again, allowing them a chance to buy back in at a later date. At the same time, there's a bit of bad news weighing on airline shares today, with The Wall Street Journal, for example, highlighting airline industry layoffs in an above-the-fold column today -- 25,000 job cuts just announced at American for example, and another 36,000 job losses in the offing at United, all because ""air-travel demand falls again amid climbing coronavirus numbers."" Meanwhile, Johns Hopkins University is reporting that global COVID-19 infections just hit a record for a one-day increase.   With news like that, I can't really blame investors for ensuring their yesterday profits don't disappear -- or fault their logic in thinking there will be more chances to buy back airline shares at lower prices, as bad news continues to follow good, day in and","Jul 16, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/16/why-airline-stocks-are-sinking-again-on-thursday.aspx
1,Should You Buy Airline Stocks Right Now? | The Motley Fool,"Should You Buy Airline Stocks Right Now?. Airline stocks still trade substantially below pre-coronavirus levels, but some clearly deserve their","   Investors have been getting conflicting signals about the airline industry in recent weeks. On the one hand, encouraging early data about vaccines under development have bolstered hopes that a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 could come to market in record time. On the other hand, the massive quarterly loss reported by Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) this week highlights the depth of airlines' near-term challenges. With this backdrop, U.S. airline stocks have settled into a trading range well above the lows plumbed in late March but below the highs briefly reached after a monster rally between mid-May and early June. Shares of Delta, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) are all down more than 50% year to date, while low-fare giant Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has fared somewhat better, falling 34% year to date.  AIRLINE STOCK YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. Let's take a look at whether these recent developments make it a good time to buy airline stocks. Over the past week, throughput at TSA checkpoints has averaged 26% of year-ago levels. While that's a whole lot better than mid-April, when the TSA was only screening 4% as many people as it was a year earlier, the lesson is that as long as the pandemic is raging, air travel demand will remain far below pre-coronavirus levels. This means that airlines' medium-term prospects depend heavily on the development of safe and effective vaccines and COVID-19 treatments. As a result, airline stocks soared on Wednesday, after biotech company Moderna said that its vaccine candidate generated a strong immune response in all 45 patients included in an early testing round. A phase 3 trial for that vaccine will begin later this month. A vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Oxford has also shown promise. It began large-scale trials in the U.K. in late May, with a 30,000-person study in the U.S. set to launch next month. Moreover, these are just two frontrunners among dozens of serious vaccine candidates. Still, it is quite common for drugs and vaccines to look promising through Phase 2 trials but run into problems during Phase 3 trials. It's also possible that -- similar to flu shots -- a vaccine could be effective at reducing the severity of the disease without completely preventing infection or transmission. The FDA's target is fairly modest, calling for vaccines to achieve at least 50% efficacy to be","Jul 16, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/16/should-you-buy-airline-stocks-right-now.aspx

Watch More of the Latest Videos on TheStreet and Jim,"Katherine Ross  Are you looking at the travel stocks and airline stocks as a buying opportunity on the Moderna news? First, let's tackle the Moderna news. Moderna reported uniformly positive data from an early trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine. Moderna said the phase 1 trial of its proposed coronavirus vaccine candidate, induced antibody reactions in all 45 patient participants, with no serious side-effects, following two injections spanning a four week period. The results open the door to a larger study of some 30,000 patients, set to begin on July 27, and follow on from the positive results in vaccine studies reported earlier this week by drugmaker Pfizer. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data looked ""really quite good,"" and highlighted the fact that patients only suffered mild side effects from the injection, such as headaches, fever and fatigue ""These positive Phase 1 data are encouraging and represent an important step forward in the clinical development of...our vaccine candidate against COVID-19, and we thank the NIH for their ongoing collaboration,"" said CEO Stephane Bancel. ""The Moderna team continues to focus on starting our Phase 3 study this month and, if successful, filing a BLA.""  Now, let's talk about the travel and airlines sectors which were getting a boost based on the Moderna news. On Tuesday, Jim Cramer said that the airlines need more financing after getting earning's from Delta.  Delta CEO Ed Bastian also said that the rebound from April’s outright plunge in domestic flying had stalled and that Delta will halve the number of extra flights it adds in August to 500. Even with the 1,000 additional flights this month, that puts it at just 30% of its normal July schedule. Over the July 4 holiday weekend, Delta flew only one-fifth as many passengers as it did a year earlier. Cramer said that he'd play the waiting game on these sectors.  Watch the video above for more.

But while concerns about spiking valuations, a resurgence of the coronavirus, and the upcoming U.S. presidential elections are presenting daunting waves of uncertainty, our readers are sticking with the stocks they rode into the crisis, and even adding to some risky bets as they navigate a tricky recovery. In our latest survey of over 1,000 readers of our daily newsletters, investors across ages unanimously agree that they are worried about current market events. Close to 70% of them are expecting the market to drop in the next three months. Investopedia’s Anxiety Index is off peaks reached during the height of the pandemic, but is still near historical highs, especially in personal finance and markets related areas.

Hard-hit airline stocks like British Airways-owner IAG ICAG.L, Ryanair RYA.I and Lufthansa LHAG.DE rose between 9.7% and 10.7%, while cruise operator Carnival Plc CCL.L jumped 11.4%. The travel & leisure index .SXTP surged 6.1% to lead sectoral gains, but still remains the worst performer in Europe this year with a 33% plunge as the coronavirus pandemic brought global travel to a halt. The pan-European STOXX 600 .STOXX rose 1.8%, closing just short of levels last seen in early March, while euro zone blue-chips .STOXX50E jumped 1.7% to hit their highest level since March 5. Investors were encouraged by an early-stage study on U.S. biotech firm Moderna Inc's MRNA.O experimental vaccine for COVID-19 that provoked immune responses. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca AZN.L jumped 5.2% after a report said positive news on the University of Oxford's potential COVID-19 vaccine that has been licensed to the drugmaker could be announced as soon as Thursday. “Our central scenario is that a vaccine would be broadly available from the second quarter of next year, or the fourth quarter of this year in our upside scenario,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients. “Various potential treatment options are also in the pipeline, raising hopes that societies can cope with the pandemic without full shutdowns.” Expectations were also high among investors heading into an EU summit later this week that leaders will agree on a recovery fund of 750 billion euros for pandemic-hammered economies.

11,Boeing Stock Is Soaring on Hope for a Vaccine | Barron's,"Boeing Stock Is Soaring on Hope for a Vaccine. . . The Boeing Co. manufacturing facility stands in North Charleston,","    The best thing for commercial aerospace these days would be an effective vaccine against Covid-19. The biotech Moderna said Tuesday it is closer to delivering just that, so stock in Boeing, aerospace suppliers, and airlines is, well, soaring in premarket trading. Moderna (ticker: MRNA) says its coronavirus vaccine is entering a Phase 3 medical trial. That’s good news for the world and aerospace investors. Drugs and vaccines typically move through three phases. A Phase 1 trial is, generally speaking, a safety study. Phase 2 is about drug dosing. Phase 3 is an efficacy trial. Moderna stock is up almost $11, or 15%, in premarket trading on its positive announcement. That’s more than $4 billion of market value created. But that is only part of the hope-vaccine-value paradigm. Boeing (BA) shares are up 3% in premarket trading. Supplier Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) stock is up almost 4%, American Airlines (AAL) shares are up closer to 9%. That is, roughly, another $4 billion in market value created. The premarket moves are an illustration of the power of a vaccine for the travel industry. People aren’t getting on cruises or planes amid the pandemic. U.S. commercial air travel dropped about 81% year over year in June. Since the start of 2020, Covid-19 has wiped out more than $300 billion in commercial aerospace value. That covers declines in aerospace suppliers Barron’s tracks, as well as aircraft makers Boeing and Airbus (AIR. France), along with major U.S. airline stocks. That number is also a rough approximation for what the value of a vaccine could be for the industry. It’s about 56% more than where aerospace industry stocks are trading as of Wednesday’s close. The overall market value of the aerospace stocks Barron’s tracks totals about $580 billion. Of course, everyone would benefit from a vaccine, not just aerospace. S&P 500 futures are up about 1.3% on the Moderna news. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 1.6%. A 1% gain in all U.S. stocks generates more than $330 billion in market value. Hope is the most valuable asset out there right now. If everything goes well, Moderna says it can deliver 500 million to 1 billion doses a year, starting in 2021.

Fasten your seat belts.,"      Ryan Vanzo | July 15, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) investors should be nervous. The coronavirus rages on globally, keeping a tight lid on air traffic. Last quarter, the company cut 95% of its capacity. This summer, flight numbers remain more than 50% below their pre-pandemic highs. But isn’t this the time to buy? As Baron Rothschild once said, buy when there’s blood in the streets. Shares trade at multi-year lows. A simple reversion to the mean could add 250% in near-term upside. Yet there’s another popular saying we should all keep in mind: “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked.” Warren Buffett is responsible for that one. His wisdom should never be ignored. When it comes to airline stocks like Air Canada, Buffett remained highly skeptical for years. One of his chief worries was that the tide could go out at any time. Whether that means a terrorist attack, climate regulation, new competition, or a sudden surge in fuel price, the industry has always been vulnerable. The COVID-19 crisis was unprecedented, yet it’s unknown factors like this that make airlines so volatile. If you own airline stocks like Air Canada, it may be time to sell. But before you do, understand the key facts below. Airlines were originally projecting a V-shaped recovery following the initial COVID-19 wave at the start of 2020. They believed that high-margin business travel would buoy demand. Those hopes were quickly dashed. In recent weeks, anticipation for a business travel rebound sent airline stocks higher, including Air Canada. Yet again, investors were left disappointed. “The industry is counting on corporate travel to boost revenue in the fall and winter. Yet signs of a comeback in business travel are looking increasingly remote,” reported Barrons last week. “We see an uncomfortable reality brewing within the rhetoric of many global companies, particularly in our own financial services sector: We are going to all be at home a lot longer than we currently anticipate … and many of us will never return to office-based work at all,” added Citigroup’s Mark Manduca, throwing cold water on a rebound in business air travel. Even Air Canada now thinks that a recovery will take years to unfold. “It is our current expectation that it will take at least three years to recover to 2019 levels of revenue","Jul 15, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/07/15/air-canada-tsxac-stock-investors-time-to-sell/

EVERY SATURDAY MORNING.  Take a look before this sneak preview gets taken down! Video Here! <<<< Sponsored The shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) are down 3.4% to trade at $35.12 at last check, ahead of the company's fiscal second-quarter report, which is due out after the close on Tuesday, July 21. Below, we will take a look at the equity's latest performance on the charts, and explore some of the options activity surrounding UAL ahead of the event.  The equity has had a rough go of it on the charts in the past few months, dipping to $17.80, its lowest level in around eight years, during the broader market's mid-March pullback. Though the equity recovered to record three-month peak of $48.95 on June 5, it's still down 60% year-to-date. However, it's worth noting that UAL closed above the descending 100-day moving average yesterday, and is set to do the same today unless some serious negative action drives the stock any lower.  All of this, in conjunction with the ongoing impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the travel sector, has left analysts skeptical on United Airlines stock. Of the 12 in coverage, eight sport a tepid ""hold."" Conversely, the remaining four call it a ""strong buy."" Plus, UAL's consensus 12-month target price of $41.27 is a 17.5% premium to current levels, which could signal some price-target cuts in the near future. A look at the United Airline stock's history of post-earnings reactions during the past two years shows a very positive response, with just two negative occurrences; however, it's interesting to note that both of these negative instances took place after its two most recent reports. UAL averaged a post-earnings swing of 5.2% the last eight quarters, regardless of direction. This time around, the options market is pricing in a slightly higher move of 9.3%.

A look at the shareholders of Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) can tell us which group is most powerful. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership. Spirit Airlines isn't enormous, but it's not particularly small either. It has a market capitalization of US$1.5b, which means it would generally expect to see some institutions on the share registry. In the chart below, we can see that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about Spirit Airlines. See our latest analysis for Spirit Airlines Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Spirit Airlines already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Spirit Airlines, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Spirit Airlines is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is FMR LLC, with ownership of 8.6%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.2% and 5.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
