FLEXSHARES","Fears that the COVID-19 outbreak will worsen and further stifle global business travel and tourism punished the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) last week, but some market observers believe the recent dip in airline stocks could be a meaningful buying opportunity. JETS seeks to track the performance of the U.S. Global Jets Index, which is composed of the exchange-listed common stock (or depository receipts) of U.S. and international passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers, airports, and terminal services companies across the globe. “Airline stocks are bearing the brunt of the markets’ coronavirus fears,” reports Al Root for Barron’s. “That makes sense, to some extent. Global health fears and events such as the 9/11 attacks have, in the past, sent airline traffic plunging, and people on planes, after all, is the lifeblood of the industry. Travel always bounced back, but not before airlines started to buckle under the weight of their debt loads.” There’s never a good time for an epidemic, but the emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak dealt a blow to airlines operating internationally because China moved to curb Lunar New Year festivities and harsh restrictions on travel to and from the country are expected to crimp first-quarter profits for many JETS components. That after the industry was profitable, broadly speaking, each year over the past decade. What’s more, China’s travel industry experienced a strong December, making the timing of the coronavirus outbreak all the more burdensome. “China’s transportation industry expanded steadily in December 2019, an industry index showed Wednesday,” a China.org.cn report noted. “The China Transportation Services Index (CTSI) stood at 175.3 points in December 2019, up 5.3 percent year on year, according to the China Academy of Transportation Sciences.” The transportation can be a key bellwether when it comes to assessing the health of the economy—if products are moving, the economy is grooving. The same goes for China, which saw its transportation sector rise steadily during the month of December. Plus, airline equities are attractively valued. “After all, today the sector is more consolidated and profitable. And debt compared with earnings for the sector is in line with other industrial companies,” according to Barron’s. “But the price-to-earnings ratios that investors pay for the stocks don’t reflect the improvement. The sector trades for 6.4 times estimated 2020 earnings, a huge discount to the S&P 500 multiple.” For more on multi-asset strategies, please visit our Multi-Asset Channel.

3,Why Shares of American Airlines Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Shares of American Airlines Are Falling Today. Investors are beginning to wonder if transatlantic, or even domestic, cancellations are","   Shares of airline stocks traded down again on Monday on continued concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak on travel. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) continues to get hit particularly hard, down nearly 5% at midday. Airlines have been among the sectors hardest hit by coronavirus concerns, as the companies have been forced to suspend service to parts of Asia. The recent spread of the virus into new regions, including confirmed cases and deaths in the United States, have led to concerns about a much broader, and prolonged, impact on the sector. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. Cowen analyst Helane Becker on Monday raised the prospect that airlines could be forced to start canceling transatlantic flights or even start drawing down domestic capacity if demand weakens. A growing number of companies are also limiting corporate travel, which is significant because major airlines depend on corporate accounts for much of their profits. Should business travel decline, airlines could attempt to fill seats by offering lower fares. But that would be profit-draining at best and could be difficult if consumer anxiety about the outbreak further cuts into demand. American Airlines shares have fallen faster and harder than those of other airlines because it is considered the most vulnerable to a prolonged slowdown. The airline has the highest debt burden among U.S. carriers, and going into 2020 it had made paying down that debt a priority. With the Boeing 737 MAX grounding affecting operations and now the threat of lower revenue and profits for the year due to health concerns, American's recovery is going to take longer than expected to materialize. With Monday's sell-off, American shares have now fallen more than 37% since Feb. 15. The company now trades at less than 0.3 times sales.  AIRLINE DATA BY YCHARTS American has significant issues, but in all but the worst-case scenario it should have the wherewithal to avoid a bankruptcy filing. It's hard to recommend investors jump into the shares due to the continued virus-related uncertainty and the long-term nature of the airline's turnaround plan, but with each passing day of declines the sell-off is beginning to feel more overdone.

4,Travel Stocks Are In a Bear Market. It Might Be Time to Buy.  | Barron's,Travel Stocks Are In a Bear Market. It Might Be Time to Buy.. Newsletter Sign-up. Barron's Tech. Here’s BofA’s List,"  The stock market is in a correction, but travel-related stocks are in a bear market. Things happened incredibly fast last week, and it feels strange to say it this early into recent stock declines, but it may be time to buy travel stocks. Investors, at least, should start looking for value in the beaten-up space. The S&P 500 recently entered correction territory—defined as a 10% drop from highs—and it was the fastest the market had ever corrected from an all-time high, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 dropped 12.8% for the week and is down 14% from its highs. The comparable numbers for the Dow Jones Industrial Average are 12.4% and 14.1%, respectively. Travel stocks have been, understandably, hit harder than the broader market. Investors fear that potential customers will stay at home, hitting 2020 earnings for the sector. A basket of a dozen travel-related stocks that Barron’s tracks—including airlines such as Southwest Airlines (ticker: LUV), hotels such as Hilton Worldwide (H), travel agencies such Expedia (EXPE), cruise operators such as Carnival (CCL) and casinos such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS)—are down 22% year to date and 28% from their 52-week highs, on average. That is bear-market territory. A bear market is usually defined as a 20% drop from the highs. The questions for travel investors are how bad can it get and do recent decline create some opportunities? Based on history, it looks as if it shouldn’t get that much worse for the sector, from a stock-market perspective. The price-to-sales ratio for travel and leisure stocks is only about 5% higher than lows experienced in 2012. Price-to-sales is one valuation proxy that can be useful in market downturns. Earnings—and Wall Street earnings estimates—can be volatile in times of market uncertainty. Sales can rise and fall, too, but to a smaller degree. Looking at price-to-sales can help show investors what is normal for a sector. In the case of the leisure and travel stocks Barron’s examined, the recent average price-to-sales ratio is almost 40% below the historical average. Back in 2012, the European debt crisis was peaking and oil prices average more than $110 for the second consecutive year. Oil prices represent a big costs for airlines and cruise operators and push up travel prices for the public.

CNBC Newsletters,"United Airlines is postponing start dates for some new pilots this month and warned about further flight reductions, the carrier confirmed Sunday. A 23-person class of pilots that was supposed to start training this week has been postponed. CNBC had reported the schedule change earlier on Sunday. The delay comes as the COVID-19 outbreak spreads, prompting United and its competitors to scale back some international routes. Pilot training can take several months before aviators start flying for the airline. The coronavirus is a new challenge for airlines that have been dealing with slower-than-expected growth because of the nearly yearlong grounding of the Boeing 737 Max after two fatal crashes. In a note to employees sent Saturday, United CEO Oscar Munoz praised employees for how they’ve handled the abrupt changes and outlined additional materials, such as gloves and cleaning materials, sent to crews and vendors in areas that have been hit with the outbreak. “I am confident that our deeply embedded safety practices and commitment to health and safety puts us a step ahead in terms of keeping our aircraft and workspaces clean and sanitary,” wrote Munoz, who is handing the reins over to United’s president, Scott Kirby, in May. Munoz told employees that “we are strategically managing our Atlantic and domestic service, mindful of travel directives from the federal government, fluctuating demand and of course, the advice of public health experts,” Munoz wrote. “Based on current trends, it is likely that additional schedule reductions will be necessary.” United is also offering some pilots who fly the widebody aircraft used on trans-Pacific routes a month off at reduced pay after the airline cut some of its Asia flights, according to a memo sent Friday by the United pilots’ union.  United has “worked with our union partners to offer pilots associated with those changes the opportunity to voluntarily adjust their near-term schedules, as we do whenever business needs allow,” a spokeswoman said. “Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and work closely with our labor partners to help manage our business to minimize the operational and financial disruption of the outbreak.” Airlines have ramped up their pilot hiring in recent years as they faced increasing demand and more pilots near the federally mandated retirement age of 65.

And despite the World Health Organization refusing to name the bug a pandemic, it’s growing clear that’s exactly what’s on our hands. Wall Street is trying to be in a good mood about all this, but industries like cruise line  airline stocks are feeling the effects. This is comes as number of deaths in the United States grows, and after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) supported markets with nearly a $1 billion purchase of Japanese equities and nearly $5 billion worth of bonds over the weekend. Such action is in keeping with the theme of this bull market: Something does bump, and the monetary policy stimulus pours in. But this time feels different. Just hours after the BOJ’s actions, the negative headlines continued with first infections reported in New York City, Moscow and elsewhere. As a result, while the major U.S. averages have clawed into positive territory thanks to — you guessed it — large-cap technology stocks, key areas like transportation continue to be in the tank.

This comes on top of already suspended or cancelled flights to Asia in response to the outbreak. Furthermore, United CEO Oscar Munoz told employees recently in an email that the company would likely need to cut additional flights due to a drop in demand.

Pence, who is overseeing the administration's efforts, will attend a meeting on Wednesday with airline officials Wednesday. Administration and airline officials said those planning to attend include the chief executives of American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O, United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O, Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N and JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O. Many of the airline CEOs will speak Thursday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce Aviation summit in Washington. Airline stocks have fallen sharply in recent weeks but rebounded from heavy intraday losses on Monday. American, which closed down 1% on Monday, is off 38% in the last two weeks. United, which closed off 0.5%, is down 25% since Feb. 13. Pence's office said he will meet on Saturday with cruise line chief executives in Florida. He will also meet with 3M Co MMM.N executives in Minnesota, where 3M is based, on Thursday. 3M told CNBC last week it was ramping up production of its N95 respirator mask due to rising demand.

Airline failures loom as outbreak spreads: ISTAT panelists.,"Welcome to flightglobal.com. This site uses cookies. Read our policy. By Cirium2 March 2020 Indonesia’s Lion Air Group has put on hold plans for an initial public offering, a source tells Cirium. The company was expected to make the call at the end of February, but the person says some investors have been reluctant to hold face-to-face meetings amid the coronavirus outbreak. Moreover, it has been difficult to get investors on board given the regional and global downturn in airline stocks. “Even if the traffic in Indonesia is still very strong, the reality is investors cannot understand that. There is no point trying to launch it now,” a person with knowledge of the IPO says. Citing unidentified sources close to the matter, reports by Reuters indicate that the company planned to raise as much as $500 million. It launched a pre-marketing drive in January to gauge investor appetite and held roadshows across global finance centres in the early part of February. Lion Air Group tells Cirium the company “does not comment on market speculation”. The company first expressed an interest to go public in 2011, proposing that around 30% of its shares could be floated in 2012 to raise around $1 billion. Lion Air founder Rusdi Kirana said in an April 2014 interview that the IPO would only take place after the group gained a 65% market share in Indonesia. In November 2014, John Duffy, then head of the company’s aircraft leasing arm, indicated that Lion was “seriously considering an IPO in the second half” of 2015. In a February 2015 interview, Kirana explained that one of the rationales for the IPO was to fund an airport project in Lebak Regency, an hour’s drive from the capital Jakarta. This would help meet its expansion needs, which were constrained by the congestion at Soekarno-Hatta international airport. That airport project was eventually scrapped amid Jakarta’s concern of possible disruption to air traffic at a nearby airport. Only in February 2017 did Kirana admit that all plans for an IPO had been put on ice as market conditions were not conducive. Last November, Lion told Cirium that it was postponing the IPO plan in 2019 because it “wanted to determine the right timing [to conduct the IPO]”.

American Airlines to get $5.5bn loan","PUBLISHED : 2 MAR 2020 AT 16:33 WRITER: SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST Cathay Pacific Group has 120 planes sitting on the tarmac at any given time, accounting for about half of its fleet, and has scrapped more than three-quarters of its weekly flights in March. Sources familiar with the situation said the number of planes left on the ground was likely to rise as Cathay warned of further cuts in flight schedules. ""We are continuously assessing our fleet and aircraft deployment in order to best align capacity with market demand,"" a spokeswoman for the airline said, declining to address the number of parked planes. Last week, Cathay said 75% of staff, or 25,000 employees of the group, would take unpaid leave.  The airline's flying schedules for March show a decline of around 75%, according to a study by the South China Morning Post. Originally, around 1,470 flights per week were scheduled in March for Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon. That number has now been cut by more than 1,120. During the Sars crisis of 2003, Cathay reduced its passenger schedule by 45% and parked 22 aircraft out of a fleet of 80. The crisis at Cathay, the worst hit airline outside mainland China, is being replicated globally as major airlines implement emergency cost saving to cutting flights across the board. Fear of travelling coincides with the coronavirus epidemic spreading outside Asia to Europe and the United States, and fast-spreading Covid-19 cases outside China, notably in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Airline stocks plunged in the past week, the worst week for financial markets since the 2008 financial crisis, wiping billions off the value of these companies. American Airlines, the world's biggest carrier, saw its stock fall 21.6% over five days. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, tumbled 17%. ""An outbreak is the kind of macro impact that is really hard for an airline to plan around,"" said Bocom International analyst Luya You, who cited Cathay's efforts during the city's civil unrest to prop up its revenue with transit passengers who could bypass Hong Kong. ""During an outbreak, all of it collapses because people no matter the price point they are no longer willing to fly.""

comments  Major airlines have seen more than £15billion wiped off their value in just six days as coronavirus clobbers the travel industry. Efforts by central banks to reassure investors' frayed nerves helped prop up the FTSE 100 yesterday. But it was not enough to prevent another rout on airline stocks, as shares in British Airways owner IAG plunged another 8.2 per cent.  Nosedive: Shares in British Airways owner IAG plunged another 8.2 per cent yesterday as the worsening coronavirus outbreak wreaked havoc on the travel industry It means 30 per cent – some £3.8billion – has been wiped off the aviation giant's value in just six days of trading. Easyjet was also among the FTSE fallers, and like IAG is now worth 30 per cent less than when the markets opened last Monday. Dart, the owner of Jet 2, fell 9 per cent yesterday, meaning the company has lost 41 per cent of its value in just over a week. As BA and Ryanair cancelled hundreds more flights, one analyst described airline stocks as 'in the doldrums', while another warned they could thwart any recovery in the stock market.  On another turbulent day for the travel industry, the Bank of England attempted to calm investors reeling after the worst week on the stock markets since the financial crisis. Echoing statements from other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, it said it was working to 'ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability'. The statement appeared to provide some consolation to investors as the FTSE 100 edged up 1.1 per cent or 74 points to 6654.89. Ocado shares jumped after it revealed that customers worried about coronavirus are stockpiling food and other goods. Investors piled in after the online supermarket emailed customers to advise them to place orders further in advance because of 'exceptionally high demand'.

The decline has certainly hurt many equity investors and 401(k)s, and there may still be more pain ahead. On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its threat assessment of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, to “very high,” and warned that the illness could soon reach most, “if not all,” countries across the globe in the coming days and weeks. I choose to remain optimistic, though. The underlying economy is sound. Nothing has changed about that. This selloff is purely incidental to the outbreak, and once it’s contained and the number of new infections begins to plateau, I expect to see stock markets recover sharply. The same goes for the industries that have been hardest hit by the virus, including travel and tourism, airlines and energy. Take a look at the oscillator chart below. It shows that airline stocks are trading down a rare three standard deviations, the most in at least five years. What this means is that airlines are extremely oversold and flashing a “buy” signal. As soon as this outbreak subsides, I believe airlines will begin to soar again. click to enlarge During his press conference last Wednesday, President Donald Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence to manage the U.S. response to the outbreak as well as the government’s messaging about the virus.

17,Wealthy turn to private jets to duck airlines and cut coronavirus risk,Wealthy turn to private jets to duck airlines and cut coronavirus risk. Commercial airlines have been among the hardest hit.,"London/Dallas/New York: Growing fear over coronavirus is battering commercial airline stocks, but private jet operators are seeing a spike in demand as well-heeled travelers look to minimize their public exposure and find alternatives to suspended flights. “There’s undoubtedly been a rise in demand for short-notice, on-demand charter,” said Adam Twidell, chief executive officer of jet charter provider PrivateFly. “We’ve had a very significant number of inquiries, for group evacuations, and from corporates and individuals.” Requests have included a decontamination team looking for transport within Asia and a family traveling to Bali from Hong Kong who wanted to avoid exposure to other people on a commercial flight. Charter company Victor recently had a film studio ask about flying 50 people to Los Angeles from Tokyo to limit interaction with other travelers. Such inquiries are becoming more common after the virus, which first emerged in Central China in December, has since spread to six continents, operators say. “The number of private jet requests have gone up — especially on long-haul flights,” said Richard Lewis, U.S. president of Insignia Group, which organizes travel for wealthy clients. “They’re not willing to share the cabin with other people.”    Also read: US and Australia report first deaths caused by coronavirus It’s not cheap, but can be relatively competitive with luxury commercial travel. The cost of flying round-trip from New York to London on a 12-seat Gulfstream IV is about $140,000, although squeezing that many people onboard removes some of the comfort factor. That compares with $10,000 for a first-class ticket flying commercial, complete with a lie-flat bed. For individuals and companies willing to pay extra, it’s a way to minimize the risk of infection. JetSet Group, a New York-based charter company that books roughly 150 flights a month, has seen business spike about 25% in the last few weeks. Fear of the virus appears to be driving the demand, said founder and CEO Steve Orfali, based on customer feedback,. Many of his clients have medium-sized business and have to travel to see factories or stores. Others are considering it for family vacations. “When they’re going on a personal trip, they don’t want to expose their family, so they’re anteing up and paying for a private jet rather than first-class tickets for everyone and risking it,” he said. People who don’t normally fly private are also calling. Orfali said he hopes they’ll become regular","Mar 1, 2020",https://theprint.in/economy/wealthy-turn-to-private-jets-to-duck-airlines-and-cut-coronavirus-risk/373684/
18,The 5 Best Stocks (And 5 Worst) of the Coronavirus Correction | Kiplinger,Save up to 67%. The 5 Best Stocks (And 5 Worst) of the Coronavirus Correction. The rapid spread of the,"Getty Images The rapid spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus is wreaking havoc across the equity market. The S&P 500 lost nearly 13% from Feb. 19 to Feb. 28 – the fastest descent from all-time highs into correction territory in market history. Virtually all stocks have been affected by the growing scare. The worst stocks of the correction so far have all been pummeled by issues stemming from coronavirus – in particular, from the resulting rout in oil prices. Most of the best stocks (a handful of companies that managed to finish in the black) delivered gains based on the revenue opportunity that COVID-19 potentially represents, though a couple benefited from completely unrelated good news. To get a sense of what worked and what didn't, we screened the Russell 1000 Index, which includes the thousand largest companies on the U.S. equity market, for the best- and worst-performing stocks during the steep drawdown from Feb. 19 to Feb. 28. Both the Russell 1000 and S&P 500 lost 12.8% over that period – predictably, biotechnology, travel and energy stocks were well represented among the stocks with the biggest moves. There were also a couple of pleasant surprises. Have a look at the five worst and five best stocks coming out of the market's epic February plunge. 1 of 10 Getty Images On Feb. 20, Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said it was canceling contracts with the company. Mednax said the UNH contracts represented 2% of its 2019 revenue. Moody's immediately put the company's credit ratings under review for a downgrade. UnitedHealth said it's terminating the contracts because Mednax's prices are too high. That said, a few analysts pointed out that the termination of contracts won't necessarily come to pass. ""They may turn out to be a negotiating tactic by UNH, as such threatened terminations often are,"" writes BMO Equity Research analyst Matt Borsch. 2 of 10 Getty Images Shares in Etsy (ETSY, $57.81) took off after the company delivered a beat-and-raise fourth-quarter report, fueled by a strong holiday selling season. Indeed, the online marketplace for handmade apparel and accessories posted a whopping 35% increase in revenue. ""Etsy's fourth-quarter results came in ahead of expectations and guidance, as continued platform enhancements drove strong holiday performance,"" writes Canaccord Genuity. The market is also bullish on the company's introduction of its Offsite Ads feature, in which Etsy works with sites like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Facebook","Mar 2, 2020",https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-5-best-and-5-worst-stocks-coronavirus-correction/index.html

fter weeks of relative placidity about the global spread of the novel coronavirus, financial markets snapped to attention last week and plunged with dizzying speed. U.S. stocks lost nearly 12% and $3.5 trillion was erased for U.S.-listed stocks. It was the worst week for stocks since the financial crisis in October of 2008. It may get worse still. The rapid spread the virus combined with the swift reaction in multiple countries to impose restrictions on travel and daily life represented first an economic blow to industries such as airlines and tourism and then, because the epicenter of the virus began in China in the city of Wuhan, to global supply chains that rely on Chinese components. That in itself might not have triggered a market panic, but markets have been so strong and so steady that they were poised for a fall—or so many have been saying for months. The virus, in addition to its real-world implications, was a match for financial markets that had become the equivalent of dry tinder. The ingredients for a conflagration were there, and all it took was a spark.

Market players like to endlessly debate whether stocks and bonds are trading at some mythical “right” price. Before this current plunge, there was no dearth of voices arguing that stocks were massively overvalued and that bonds and interest rates have been kept way too low by central banks that still haven’t returned to normal more than a decade since the last major financial crisis. Others were saying, not unreasonably, that while stock prices are elevated, historically speaking, they reflect sound fundamentals: companies such as the big tech leaders Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have been making oodles of money and hefty double-digit profits and so, according to the more bullish reasoning, deserve hefty premiums in the stock prices.      No matter which side of this eternal divide between bulls and bears one falls on, one thing has been undeniable: markets spent almost all of 2019 in an upward drift with very little sharp movements. And one thing that modern financial markets do not tend to do for extended periods of time is stay calm.
