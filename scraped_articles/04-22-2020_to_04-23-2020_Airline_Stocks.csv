2,Do The Bailouts Make Airline Stocks Investable Now? - TheStreet,. . Do The Bailouts Make Airline Stocks Investable Now?. Buffett Dumps the Airlines - How the Charts for Delta,"Airline stocks are down massively this year as passenger travel has fallen by 96%. They need government intervention to survive. People are understandably upset to see companies that spent 96% of their free cash flow over the last 10 years on stock buybacks, totaling about $50 billion, encounter a crisis and subsequently ask for $50 billion to avoid bankruptcy. The government is stepping in and will keep the airlines afloat, but does this provide any reassurance that they’re investable? The airlines will get their requested $50 billion, which includes $25 billion in grants and $25 billion in federal loan programs. The government’s motivation for providing this support is to prevent layoffs and pay disruption to hundreds of thousands of airline employees, a mandate that is actually baked into the requirements for receiving funds. Part of the terms explicitly forbid laying off employees or altering collective bargaining agreements prior to Sept. 30, 2020. Additionally, there are much-deserved limitations placed on executive compensation, dividends and stock buybacks. In my estimation, these conditions don’t go far enough in terms of executive and board ramifications for stock buyback irresponsibility, but it’s nice to see their inclusion. According to investment bank Cowen, airlines are being provided approximately 76% of their payroll expenses, with total aid at this time breaking down as follows: American Airlines (AAL) - Get Report, $10.5 billion; Delta (DAL) - Get Report, $5.4 billion; United (UAL) - Get Report, $4.95 billion; Southwest Airlines (LUV) - Get Report $3.3 billion; Alaska (ALK) - Get Report and its carrier Horizon, $992 million; JetBlue (JBLU) - Get Report, $936 million; Spirit (SAVE) - Get Report, $335 million; Hawaiian (HA) - Get Report, $289 million; Allegiant (ALGT) - Get Report, $172 million; SkyWest (SKYW) - Get Report, $438 million; and Mesa (MESA) - Get Report, $76 million. SPECIAL REPORT: Download Jim Cramer's 25 Rules for Investing Whitepaper and become a smarter investor. Much to their chagrin, only 70% of the money received will be in the form of grants, with the other 30% in low-interest loans that must be repaid, adding more debt to companies that already operate with significantly high leverage. These 10-year loans stipulate warrants be provided that are convertible to equity equal to 10% of the loan value; assuming the airlines survive and return to their former profitability, these warrants could eventually prove very lucrative for taxpayers.

3,Why Airline Shares Are Down Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Down Today. Delta's first-quarter results paint a grim picture for the airline sector.. What happened. So,"   Airline shares were under pressure Wednesday after Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) became the first in the sector to post first-quarter results. Delta actually lost less money in the quarter than analysts had anticipated, but the airline was clear that things have only gotten worse since the first quarter ended. Shares of Delta were down 4% as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, while shares of airlines deemed more vulnerable went down further -- American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) were both down more than 7%. Before markets opened Wednesday, Delta reported a first-quarter loss of $0.51 per share on revenue of $8.6 billion, compared to analyst expectations for a $0.70-per-share loss on sales of $8.9 billion. We came into earnings season knowing that airlines were likely to report massive losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but investors are interested in hearing what the companies say about their outlook for the future. Delta sees no quick turnaround, saying it expects to bring total capacity down by 85% (year over year) by June. The company is also selling fewer seats on the flights it is flying to promote social distancing, which means preventing passengers from sitting in middle seats. IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. Delta is also making progress on the cost side, forecasting that total expenses in the second quarter will be down about 50% due to reduced flying and subsequent fuel savings, as well as consolidating airport facilities and temporarily closing airport lounges. It's also benefiting from 37,000 employees opting to take short-term unpaid leave, and from executive pay reductions. The airline was burning through about $100 million per day in March, but hopes to have that burn rate moderate to about $50 million per day by the end of June. On a post-earnings call with investors, CEO Ed Bastian said Delta is preparing for an extended downturn, saying it could take up to three years before travel recovers. There was no company-specific news from either American or Spirit, but both airlines are seen as far more vulnerable to an extended downturn than Delta is. American has the industry's highest debt load, and would be hitting a recession with its transformation plan still in its early stages. Spirit also has substantial debt relative to its peers, and so far has not secured funding from the payroll-protection part of the $50 billion airline bailout package.

4,3 Top Value Stocks to Buy Now | The Motley Fool,3 Top Value Stocks to Buy Now. Alleviate your fear of missing out.. Waste Management. Southwest Airlines. The Walt Disney,"   According to The Wall Street Journal, April 6 to April 17, 2020, saw the best two-week performance by the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the 1930s. If you feel like you've missed out on the market's rise, don't worry, there's value if you know where to look. Here are three value stocks that have the financial strength to take you far over the long term. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. While the S&P 500 is up 29% since March 23, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) has only clawed back 14%. At around $100 a share, it's still over 20% off its 52-week high.  WM DATA BY YCHARTS Waste Management is one of those companies that impacts everyday life, but you may have never considered as an investment. The company has the largest waste collection, transportation, and disposal business in the United States. Environmentalists may like the company for its transition from diesel to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) for its trucking fleet, its conversion of waste into energy, and its status as the largest recyclables collector in the U.S. Value investors may like the company for its strong market position due to its lack of competitors. Aside from the public sector in the form of county and city waste programs and a few other companies, the waste management business isn't exactly easy to get into. Federal and state permits vary based on the type of waste and in what capacity it's being managed. Factor in all of the start-up costs like trucking fleets, storage, health and safety, and more, and it's soon apparent the barriers to entry are high.Since Waste Management is the market leader, you can be confident knowing that competition is not a primary concern with this company. Although not necessarily a value stock from a P/E ratio or price-to-free cash flow (FCF) perspective, Waste Management's value is that it is about as recession-proof as you can get for an industrial company. Trash has been a growing business. A growing population means more waste and an environmentally conscious population means a greater emphasis on recycling, sustainability, biofuels, and landfill efficiency, making Waste Management an industrial you can buy and hold forever.

7,AAL Stock Is Crazy Cheap But Extremely Risky | InvestorPlace,American Airlines Stock Is Crazy Cheap But Extremely Risky. AAL stock is absurdly cheap for investors willing to stomach extreme," Airlines have been one of the hardest-hit industries in 2020 thanks to the novel coronavirus. American Airlines (NYSE:AAL) stock is down 61.4% year-to-date, and it’s not alone. Travel restrictions have banned many flights and brought the global travel industry to a screeching halt.  American Airlines stock is now trading at under $12 for the first time, which brings us to three three major questions for investors. First, can the company survive Covid-19? Second, how much debt and dilution will it take to weather the storm? And third, will things ever get back to normal for airlines? At this point, I believe the first question seems to have been answered. Yes, American will survive Covid-19. The government has made clear it will support the airline industry with bailouts. Airlines are essential businesses, and they are all struggling. And I believe President Trump and his supporters would not appreciate the optics of a full government takeover of a major airline like American. On April 14, American announced it received $5.8 billion in aid from the government. That aid included $4.1 billion via a direct grant and a $1.7 billion low-rate loan. American also said it anticipates obtaining a separate $4.75 billion loan from the Treasury. As part of the terms of the bailout, airlines were on the hook for paying back just 30% of the grants. In other words, American just got $2.87 billion of no-strings-attached cash. Which brings us to the second question. What will it take for American to survive the downturn? Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) has said the government would be taking a 1% equity stake in the company as part of its bailout. Airlines are also banned from laying off workers before Sept. 30. They can’t pay dividends or buy back stock until Sept. 30, 2021. American was forced to issue warrants as part of its bailout that could end up giving the Treasury a 6% ownership stake in the company. That dilution seems relatively small, but the key will be whether or not the current bailout is enough. Every time American needs more support, it takes on more debt and/or dilutes shareholders further. The third question of if and when things will get back to normal is on the minds of all investors regardless of market sector. First of all, I do think things will eventually get back to normal. Sure, some things may","Apr 22, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/04/american-airlines-aal-stock-cheap-but-risky/

Growing,"      Cindy Dye | April 23, 2020 | More on: AC CJT At the beginning of 2020, Air Canada (TSX:AC) had a market capitalization of nearly $21 billion. At writing, Air Canada’s market cap is below $5 billion. The company has slashed its workforce, suspended routes, and is looking to the government for financial aid. Overall, Air Canada has trimmed its operations by 90% since last month. When the company releases its quarterly earnings on May 4, analysts are anticipating an approximate 18% drop in revenue from the previous year. No one knows how deep the carnage at Air Canada will be or how long the coronavirus impact will last. If these numbers scare you, you are not alone. But rather than giving up on the entire industry, consider one stock with great potential during the pandemic and after. Cargojet (TSX:CJT) is best known as a leading provider of time-sensitive overnight cargo. This business, as well as the company’s ACMI business (in which aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance are leased), has been growing every year. With the ongoing pandemic, however, Cargojet has quickly been able to redeploy its aircraft to support massive increases in volume for e-commerce, healthcare, and essential supplies to combat the coronavirus outbreak. As of this writing, the stock is trading at $124.36 — up from a share price of $105 at the beginning of the year. In late 2018, Cargojet’s market capitalization hit $1 billion for the first time. Today, Cargojet has a market cap of over $1.9 billion! Even before the pandemic, Cargojet’s business was booming due in large part to the company’s e-commerce services. Last year, Cargojet’s total revenue was $486.6 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Currently, the company represents over 90% of the domestic overnight air cargo lift available in Canada. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the percentage of e-commerce shopping in Canada as a percentage of total sales was expected to grow 4.7% CAGR through 2024. Due to the pandemic, however, this percentage will likely increase as consumers get accustomed to shopping online, which translates to even greater domestic opportunities for Cargojet. Not only is the company’s transport business growing, but Cargojet’s ACMI business posted growth of approximately 40% over last year. The ACMI business is especially beneficial to the bottom line, as this business provides higher margins.

10,United Airlines To Sell 39 Million Common Shares - Simple Flying,United Airlines To Sell 39 Million Common Shares. United Airlines looks to multiple sources for funding. US taxpayers could end," United Airlines wants to get up close and personal with your wallet. On Tuesday, the Chicago based airline began offering 39,250,000 shares of its common stock. The underwriters, Morgan Stanley and Barclays are selling the stock in the USD$25.95-$26.50 range. The move could potentially raise more than USD$1 billion for the airline. Like airlines everywhere, United Airlines has been hit hard this year by evaporating travel demand. Two days ago, it posted a preliminary USD$2.1 billion loss over the first quarter of 2020. United Airlines has cut around 80% of its capacity across April and expects to increase this to 90% in May. The decision by United Airlines to raise more funds by issuing shares follows the airline confirming that it will receive USD$5 billion under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This money, of which USD$3.5 billion will be a direct grant and USD$1.5 billion will be a low-interest rate loan, will be used for payroll expenses. It also comes just days after the airline announced a sale and leaseback deal with Bank of China Aviation. That deal involves six Boeing 787-9s and 16 Boeing 737-9s. The funds raised via the stock offering will be used for general corporate expenses. United’s general corporate expenses are those expenses incurred as part of its daily operations. They do not include selling and administration expenses. The announcement of the stock issue on Tuesday sent United’s stock price down 3%. The stock price has already dropped 67% over the last three months. United’s stock price closed at USD$27.88 on 21 April. It is a long way from a 12 month high of USD$96.03. Besides yesterday’s new stock offering and the payroll assistance funding, United Airlines also plans to access a further USD$4.5 billion via alternative government packages pitched at airlines. This later arrangement requires United to issue shares based on the amount borrowed. According to MarketWatch, United will give the US Treasury warrants to buy up to 4.6 million shares of its common stock at a strike price of USD$31.50 per share, a good premium on the current price. MarketWatch notes that United Airlines can issue warrants for up to 14.2 million shares. The upshot of this is that US taxpayers could end up being the fourth largest stockholders in United Airlines, owning 18.8 million shares. That’s about a 7.6% stake.

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 2.29%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.99%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 2.81%. Coming into today, shares of the airline had lost 20.05% in the past month. In that same time, the Transportation sector gained 15.52%, while the S&P 500 gained 19.13%. LUV will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 28, 2020. On that day, LUV is projected to report earnings of -$0.49 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 170%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4.72 billion, down 8.35% from the year-ago period. Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $0.10 per share and revenue of $14.85 billion. These totals would mark changes of -97.66% and -33.78%, respectively, from last year. Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for LUV. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.

Delta’s stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, rose modestly in pre-market action from Tuesday’s drop, trading above $23. Here were the main results from the report, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Revenue: $8.6 billion vs. $9.19 billion expected Adjusted loss per share: 84 cents vs. 87 cents expected In a stark memo to employees, CEO Ed Bastian warned that more pain was on the horizon. “The second quarter will be worse. The decline in travel has reduced our expected revenues for the period by $11 billion, or 90 percent, compared to a year ago,” Bastian said. He voiced confidence that people will begin to travel again, but cautioned that layoffs could be coming as Delta looks at shrinking its workforce. “We don’t know when it will happen, but we do know that Delta will be a smaller airline for some time, and we should be prepared for a choppy, sluggish recovery even after the virus is contained,” he added. With the COVID-19 crisis gripping the world, Delta and its airline peers have been forced to take a number of steps, such as making steep cuts to capacity and making significant travel concessions to flyers. Delta has also taken aggressive steps to conserve cash, ending the quarter with $6 billion in unrestricted liquidity. The company expects that amount to rise to $10 billion by the end of Q2. According to CFO Paul Jacobson, “we were burning $100 million per day at the end of March [but] decisive actions” taken by the company will cut that amount in half by the end of the second quarter. Those steps include grounding 650 aircraft, more than two-thirds of Delta’s fleet, and instituting a company-wide hiring freeze as well as offering voluntary leave options. Delta employs 90,000 people and 37,000 have taken short-term unpaid leave to help get through the crisis.   ","Apr 22, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-q1-2020-earnings-110034240.html

Explore," Learn how to get started with travel stocks – and which airline, hotel, booking and cruise travel companies to keep an eye on – with this comprehensive guide. The travel and tourism industry contributed over $9 trillion to global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, making it one of the largest sectors on the planet. That’s perhaps unsurprising, though, given how broad the industry is. There’s a huge variation in the products and services offered – and the businesses offering them. A boutique travel agency, for example, is an entirely different proposition to an international airline. However, when investors talk about travel stocks they’re usually referring to companies in any of the following four main sectors: Discover the range of markets you can spread bet on - and learn how they work - with IG Academy's online course.    Global commercial airlines generated a record $838 billion in revenue in 2019. On the stock market, the industry is usually broken down between US and European carriers – with European companies expected to see significant consolidation in the coming years. Coronavirus is likely to make this an even more pressing concern. A handful of players dominate the global hotels market, most of them located in the US. Traditional hotels have been challenged by upstart tech firms such as Airbnb in recent years, which is expected to float in the near future. Casino hotels are some of the key players in the resort market, particularly in the US and China. The time when this industry was dominated by travel agencies is well over. Now it’s the domain of online booking providers such as Booking.com and Expedia in the US, and Trip.com in China. In the UK, this came to a head with the 2019 collapse of Thomas Cook. Cruise companies have had a torrid 2020 so far, and recovery from the disastrous headlines brought about by coronavirus is likely to be slow. The cruise sector is already dominated by just three operators: Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian. You can use your IG account to invest in tourism businesses with share dealing, and trade on their share prices using CFDs and spread bets. With these derivatives, you can choose whether to open a long or a short position on travel stocks – by opening a short position, you can make a profit when the industry is in a bear market.","Apr 23, 2020",https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/travel-stocks--how-to-invest-and-the-best-companies-to-watch-200423
14,Invest in These 5 Industries When Oil Is Cheap,"Invest in These 5 Industries When Oil Is Cheap. . . The Bottom Line. Compete Risk Free with $100,000 in","As oil prices continue to drop, certain industries stand to benefit. These fall into two main categories. The first should come as no surprise: industries, like airlines and transportation, for which oil is a direct and significant cost (lower oil prices improve their profitability). The other industries that benefit from lower oil prices are those that are dependent on consumer spending. When consumers spend less on fuel, they have more disposable income for other purchases. In the Spring of 2020, oil prices collapsed amid the COVID-19 pandemic and economic slowdown. OPEC and its allies agreed to historic production cuts to stabilize prices, but they dropped to 20-year lows. Another result of the pandemic during this same time frame was a sharp drop in shares of airlines and other transportation companies, as global and domestic travel slowed dramatically. In this instance, low oil prices did not benefit these companies. To properly evaluate how these industries fare during low oil prices, we must first set a time period that corresponds with the fall of oil prices. On June 20, 2014 crude oil reached a multi-year high of over $107 per barrel. Thirteen months later, on July 29, 2015, crude oil was trading around $49 a barrel, a decline of 55%. Over this period, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) advanced 7.4%, while sectors that benefit from lower oil prices, such as consumer discretionary and consumer staples, outperformed the S&P 500 with gains of 20.5% and 10.9%, respectively. In this article, we’ll discuss the five industries that have benefited the most from low oil prices. Low oil prices have benefited a number of industries. Unsurprisingly, industries like airline and transportation that count oil as a direct cost have seen their stock prices rise. However sectors that benefit indirectly from low oil prices, like consumer discretionary and consumer staples, have done even better.

17,"United Airlines Raises Equity, We Reduce Our Fair Value | Morningstar","United Airlines Raises Equity, We Reduce Our Fair Value. SHARE THIS ARTICLE. Sponsor Center. Site Index","It's difficult to say with any certainty when air traffic will return, but we are confident that demand will eventually bounce back. We’re lowering our fair value estimate for United Airlines (UAL) by about 9.5% to $38 per share as we account for the equity issuance announced on April 22, 2020, and the firm’s acceptance of government support. United has received $6 billion government loans and has issued the government $0.65 billion in warrants that dilute the firm’s share count by about 7%. Separately, United has raised equity on the open market worth about $1 billion, which diluted previous equity holders by about 15%. We think airlines face a dismal outlook for near-term air traffic and substantial fixed costs, so we are expecting stiff operating losses in 2020. Therefore, we respect that firms may need to employ shareholder-unfriendly tools to maintain solvency while demand is in the doldrums. Longer-term, while it's difficult to say with any certainty when air traffic will return, we are confident that demand will eventually bounce back. We're modeling demand to begin to normalize in 2021. We think the primary risk to airline investors are increased leverage and equity dilution as airlines look to bolster solvency during this difficult operating environment for the airlines.

18,Coronavirus: US airlines set to report their first losses in years as travel demand falls,US airlines are losing money for the first time in years as coronavirus ends travel boom. Years to recover. Job,"Delta and United have reported their first quarterly losses in more than five years. Their competitors are also expected to release dismal results in the coming weeks. The next few months look even more painful for the sector as the coronavirus pandemic saps air travel demand during what is normally the most lucrative time of year. Air travel has dropped by more than 95% as the Covid-19 pandemic spreads around the U.S. Now, states hard-hit by the pandemic like New York are extending stay-at-home advisories for the next several weeks and canceling events through June in New York City, a sign that business isn’t even close to returning to normal yet. Bleak economic data and a rising unemployment rate are increasing doubts about when travelers will return. “People are fearing for their homes, not their holidays,” said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium, a U.K.-based aviation consulting firm. It’s not just would-be vacationers who are staying home. Also absent are high-spending corporate travelers, a crucial customer base for network carriers, as companies suspend business trips because of the virus. Delta’s CEO, Ed Bastian, on Wednesday said that revenue in the current quarter looks to be 90% lower than expected and that it could take two or three years for business to recover. “We don’t know when [the recovery] will happen, but we do know that Delta will be a smaller airline for some time, and we should be prepared for a choppy, sluggish recovery even after the virus is contained,” Bastian said in a staff note. The airline lost $534 million in the first quarter, its first loss in just over five years. United Airlines earlier this week disclosed a $2.1 billion pretax loss in the quarter ended March 31 because of the coronavirus. The Chicago-based carrier hasn’t yet set a date to report full quarterly earnings.  American Airlines CEO Doug Parker last week told CNBC that the company’s revenue is down 90% from a year ago, but that it appears to be as bad as it’s going to get. “The real question is how long you stay at the bottom and when do we begin to recover. I don’t think I know that better than anybody else,” he said. The sentiment was echoed Tuesday by JetBlue Airways CEO Robin Hayes.
