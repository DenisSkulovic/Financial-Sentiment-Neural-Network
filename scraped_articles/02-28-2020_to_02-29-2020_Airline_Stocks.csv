1,Airline stocks bear the brunt of Covid-19 volatility,Airline stocks bear the brunt of Covid-19 volatility. American airline United says demand for flights to China down ‘approximately 100%’.,"    Aer Lingus parent IAG says it is not able to give any accurate guidance to investors on what to expect from the company in financial terms this year. Photograph: Cathal McNaughton/Reuters  Travel stocks have been hit harder than most amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus epidemic, and, within that sector, airline stocks have suffered the most. It is yet another blow to an industry that has been hamstrung for much of the past year by the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max – the workhorse of many fleets worldwide. That had forced airlines, including Ryanair, to lower their ambitions for expansion of routes and passenger numbers as ordered aircraft didn’t arrive. The latest crisis presents a different concern: there are enough planes but many will have to be diverted as passengers shy away from travel to an increasing number of destinations. It is being exacerbated by the cancellation of a growing number of headline business conferences and events – including Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and the Geneva Motor Show. Aer Lingus parent IAG was the latest company to tell markets on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 meant it was no longer able to give any accurate guidance to investors on what to expect from the company in financial terms this year. The group, which includes British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, is reducing capacity, citing “demand weakness on Asian and European routes and a weakening of business travel across our network”. European rival Lufthansa has said that it will cut flights on both long and short-haul networks while staff at Europe’s other big beast, Air France-KLM, were told in a video by chief executive Ben Smith that it was readying a new round of cost-cutting to deal with the “extraordinary situation”. Budget carriers have not escaped, with EasyJet announcing plans to reduce capacity on some routes, though Ryanair is still insisting that it is business as usual – for now. The scale of the challenge for airline executives was highlighted by the commendably understated view from American airline United last week when it said demand for flights to China was down “approximately 100 per cent”. Airline chiefs are well used to dealing with disruption, whether through weather, terror attack or economic collapse. Their biggest problem this time is lack of visibility on when things might get back to anything approaching normal.

3,Airlines at center of storm as coronavirus spreads | Reuters,Airlines at center of storm as coronavirus spreads. CASUALTIES. . . . . . . . . . . .,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Sarah Young, James Davey 4 MIN READ LONDON (Reuters) - European airlines stepped up their warnings over the coronavirus outbreak on Friday, with British Airways-owner IAG and Finnair flagging a hit to profits and easyJet reporting a big drop in demand into and out of a virus-affected region in Italy. European airlines sound alarm over coronavirus impact 01:22 All three airlines also joined rivals in announcing cost cuts to help weather a storm of unknown severity and duration. A new coronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has sent demand for travel tumbling in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread around the world, raising fears of a pandemic that could plunge the global economy into recession. The crisis is exacerbating deep rooted problems in an airline industry grappling with overcapacity, environmental pressures and the grounding of Boeing's BA.N top-selling jet. IAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year, but said the uncertainty over the impact and duration of the coronavirus outbreak meant it could not give accurate guidance at this stage. However, it warned: “We are currently experiencing demand weakness on Asian and European routes and a weakening of business travel across our network resulting from the cancellation of industry events and corporate travel restrictions.” British Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days. To deal with the drop in business, IAG said it was cutting costs, without giving details - joining the likes of Germany's Lufthansa LHAG.DE and Amsterdam-based KLM AIRF.PA which have announced similar moves. It also said flight cancellations would reduce capacity growth this year, although CEO Willie Walsh said the group could start to add capacity if other airlines failed.

8,Why Shares of American Airlines Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Shares of American Airlines Are Falling Today. Uncertainty remains, but the stock is reaching oversold territory.. What happened. So","   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) continued their steady descent on Friday, falling another 6%. The stock is now down 30% for the week as investors try to gauge the full ramifications of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak on the airline industry. A miserable week for markets has been even more painful for airline investors, as evidence grows that the coronavirus outbreak will eat into first-quarter revenues and profitability, and the likelihood that the virus will impact future quarters grows. United Airlines Holdings suspended service throughout Asia on Friday until April, and there is a growing concern that the spread of the virus in the U.S. and other regions of the world will lead to depressed U.S. summer vacation bookings. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. American shares have fallen faster and harder than most of its rivals because the airline is considered to be the most vulnerable to a prolonged slowdown in travel demand. The airline has the highest debt burden among U.S. carriers, and going into 2020 it had made paying down that debt a priority. With the Boeing 737 MAX grounding impacting operations and now the threat of lower revenue and profits for the year due to health concerns, American's recovery is going to take longer than expected to materialize. The sell-off in airlines this week has not been panic-selling. The coronavirus is definitely going to affect operations, and American is particularly vulnerable. Still, it feels like we are reaching a point where something has to give. As of Friday afternoon, American trades at just 0.30 times sales and 8.6 times trailing earnings. Granted, earnings are likely to come in lower than expected this year, but the business remains healthy enough to weather a poor summer season and avoid a bankruptcy or major reorganization. Looking past the coronavirus, there are potential catalysts for American shares in the second half of 2020, assuming the 737 MAX is finally returned to service and the company's 2019 cost-cutting and revenue enhancement plans start bearing fruit. It's hard to imagine regulators allowing a rival airline to acquire American, but if the shares fall much further it's possible financial buyers could give the company a hard look. Given the near-term uncertainty, it is understandable most investors have decided to watch this play out from the sidelines. But for those who can handle the turbulence, it is a good time to be watching","Feb 28, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/28/why-shares-of-american-airlines-are-falling-today.aspx
9,13 Stock Picks Getting Hit by Coronavirus Fears | Kiplinger,Save up to 67%. 13 Stock Picks Getting Hit by Coronavirus Fears. The COVID-19 coronavirus is making its way across,"Getty Images The COVID-19 coronavirus is making its way across the world. The outbreak began at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China; it has killed roughly 2,500 people, infected more than 83,000 people overall and spread to nearly 50 countries, including the U.S., since then. The coronavirus has now passed the 2002-03 SARS and 2015 MERS outbreaks in scale, and that has triggered heavy selling: Stock indices around the world, including here at home, have been sent into correction territory. Numerous stock picks are already in bear markets. It's no small worry. The SARS outbreak tallied 774 deaths across more than 8,000 cases over a six-month period, yet helped knock China's GDP down from 11.1% in the first quarter of 2003 to 9.1% in the second quarter. The coronavirus's ultimate potential to disrupt the global economy is far worse. This health issue is weighing on most stocks, but it's cutting particularly deep into a few specific industries where the financial strain is already being felt. If there's any silver lining, it's that, like with SARS, this could end up being an opportunity to buy otherwise high-quality stocks at a discount for a potential snap-back. Here, we look at 13 stock picks that are being hammered by the coronavirus outbreak. These stocks might be best avoided until a clearer picture of the coronavirus's eventual fallout develops. But they eventually might be extremely attractive buy-the-dip prospects. 1 of 12 Getty Images Technology is becoming a more important aspect in most facets of our lives.

10,The Average Debt-To-Equity Ratio of Airline Companies,The Average Debt-To-Equity Ratio of Airline Companies. . The Debt-To-Equity Ratio. The Debt-To-Equity Ratio in the Airline Industry. The Bottom,"As of the fourth quarter, 2019, the average debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio of mainline passenger, public, airline companies in the U.S. was 1.1562. This average includes the D/E ratios of large-, mid-, and small-cap companies as follows, from highest to lowest: American Airlines (AAL) is not included as it is currently running a negative debt-to-equity ratio. The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is an important financial tool in assessing the health of a business. Many times when a person hears the word ""debt,"" a negative connotation is associated. However, debt isn't necessarily a bad liability, and it is important in running a company when managed correctly and taken on at appropriate levels. The D/E ratio is a calculation used to assess how much debt is being used to run a business compared to the equity of the business. It shows how much debt you have for every dollar of equity you have. It is calculated, simply, as total liabilities divided by shareholder equity. Both these numbers can be found on the balance sheet of a company's financial statements. If a company has a high D/E ratio, it typically indicates that the company has a high debt level per each dollar of shareholders' equity. Therefore, investors favor companies with low D/E ratios. A high D/E ratio could indicate that a company is under financial stress and lacks the ability to pay down its debt burden. A D/E ratio that is too low indicates that a company is relying on its own equity to run its business and can be seen as an inefficient use of cash. The D/E ratio is important for financial analysts to determine the health of a company, as well as for management on deciding how they should be running operations, and also for financiers on deciding whether they should be lending money to a company. It is crucial to compare the D/E ratios of companies in context to the industry that they are in. Every industry has different requirements and so will have different debt requirements. For example, a company that primarily operates online is less capital intensive than a construction company. A construction company requires tremendous amounts of equipment to operate and the need to take on debt to finance the purchase of that equipment. The average D/E ratio of major companies in the U.S. airline industry is 1.1562, which indicates that for every $1 of shareholders' equity, the","Feb 29, 2020",https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/what-average-debtequity-ratio-airline-companies.asp
11,Wealthy Jump to Private Jets to Duck Airlines and Cut Virus Risk,. . . . . . . . . . . . . BloombergQuint. Wealthy Jump to Private Jets to,"(Bloomberg) -- Growing fear over coronavirus is battering commercial airline stocks, but private jet operators are seeing a spike in demand as well-heeled travelers look to minimize their public exposure and find alternatives to suspended flights. “There’s undoubtedly been a rise in demand for short-notice, on-demand charter,” said Adam Twidell, chief executive officer of jet charter provider PrivateFly. “We’ve had a very significant number of inquiries, for group evacuations, and from corporates and individuals.” Requests have included a decontamination team looking for transport within Asia and a family traveling to Bali from Hong Kong who wanted to avoid exposure to other people on a commercial flight. Charter company Victor recently had a film studio ask about flying 50 people to Los Angeles from Tokyo to limit interaction with other travelers. Such inquiries are becoming more common after the virus, which first emerged in Central China in December, has since spread to six continents, operators say. “The number of private jet requests have gone up -- especially on long-haul flights,” said Richard Lewis, U.S. president of Insignia Group, which organizes travel for wealthy clients. “They’re not willing to share the cabin with other people.” It’s not cheap, but can be relatively competitive with luxury commercial travel. The cost of flying round-trip from New York to London on a 12-seat Gulfstream IV is about $140,000, although squeezing that many people onboard removes some of the comfort factor. That compares with $10,000 for a first-class ticket flying commercial, complete with a lie-flat bed. For individuals and companies willing to pay extra, it’s a way to minimize the risk of infection. JetSet Group, a New York-based charter company that books roughly 150 flights a month, has seen business spike about 25% in the last few weeks. Fear of the virus appears to be driving the demand, said founder and CEO Steve Orfali, based on customer feedback,. Many of his clients have medium-sized business and have to travel to see factories or stores. Others are considering it for family vacations. “When they’re going on a personal trip, they don’t want to expose their family, so they’re anteing up and paying for a private jet rather than first-class tickets for everyone and risking it,” he said. People who don’t normally fly private are also calling. Orfali said he hopes they’ll become regular clients after experiencing the convenience and time savings of such travel.

12,Coronavirus prompts United Airlines to offer pilots a month for flight cuts,United Airlines offers pilots a month off as coronavirus prompts flight cuts. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"United Airlines is offering pilots to take a month off at reduced pay, according to a union memo sent on Friday, a measure that follows flight cuts due to the spread of coronavirus. United on Friday announced service reductions throughout Asia because of the illness, known as COVID-19, which has sickened more than 83,000 people. U.S. airlines had already suspended flights to mainland China and Hong Kong. The spread of the illness has raised concerns that weak demand and new travel restrictions will prompt airlines to further cut international flights. Chicago-based United has more service to Asia than any other U.S. airline. United earlier this week pulled its full-year guidance because of the outbreak. The carrier said demand to China collapsed entirely and fell by 75% in the rest of the airline’s trans-Pacific routes because of the virus. United also on Friday announced it would postpone its investor day, which was scheduled for next Thursday because it “does not believe it is practical to expect that it can have a productive conversation focused on its long-term strategy next week.” United is now offering some widebody pilots a month off in April at the pay rate for 50 hours a month, lower than the roughly 80 hours pilots normally work, wrote Todd Insler, a United captain and chairman of the United branch of the Air Line Pilots Association, in a note to union members. “The reductions in block hours has resulted in lower line values and fewer flying opportunities in some fleets,” Insler said in the note. “We are preparing for the possibility of further reductions to our schedules as the virus spreads.” Because United reduced its flying in Asia it has “worked with our union partners to offer pilots associated with those changes the opportunity to voluntarily adjust their near-term schedules, as we do whenever business needs allow,” a United spokeswoman said. “Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and work closely with our labor partners to help manage our business to minimize the operational and financial disruption of the outbreak.” The virus is threatening to end a boom in air travel that helped propel U.S. airlines to a decade of profitability. Airline stocks fell more sharply than the broader market as corporations pulled back on business travel raising concerns about a broader slowdown in demand.

CNBC Newsletters","Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading. Big Lots — Shares of Big Lots tumbled nearly 30% after the retailer posted a quarterly earnings miss. The company reported earnings per share of $2.39 in the fourth quarter, below analyst expectations of $2.68 per share, according to FactSet. Big Lots also said it expects a “challenging” first quarter due in part to “the sales impact of supply chain disruption related to the coronavirus.” Apple — Shares of Apple dipped 1.7%, after being down more than 4% earlier in the day. Apple’s stock briefly dipped into bear market territory, down more than 20% from its most recent 52-week high. Apple has been hit over fears the coronavirus would hurt demand in China, as well as disrupt its supply chain there. The company said last week that it will likely not meet its guidance for the first quarter because of the virus impact. Cruise lines — Cruise stocks stopped their long decline and traded higher on Friday morning. Norwegian Cruise Lines spiked 4.6%, while Royal Caribbean rose 3.9% and Carnival was up 3.2%. All three are still down about 20% or more for the week. Deutsche Bank downgraded Royal Caribbean and Norwegian to hold overnight, and kept Carnival as a hold, saying in a note that “we cannot realistically recommend buying them.” Wayfair — Shares of Wayfair plummeted more than 12% following its disappointing earnings results. The online furniture retailer reported a loss of $2.80 per share, larger than the loss of $2.65 per share expected on Wall Street, according to Refinitiv. The issue for Wayfair has long been how to turn a profit. The company has been criticized for spending too much money on advertising to acquire new customers on the internet. Airlines — Major airline stocks fell on Friday as flight cancellations and travel advisories continued to expand due to the epidemic. Delta, American and United all dropped more than 3%, and United announced that it is reducing its flights to Asia. Southwest and JetBlue were off more than 1%.

15,A Sliding Share Price Has Us Looking At American Airlines Group Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAL) P/E Ratio,. . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD.,"                                                   Unfortunately for some shareholders, the American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) share price has dived 31% in the last thirty days. That drop has capped off a tough year for shareholders, with the share price down 45% in that time. Assuming nothing else has changed, a lower share price makes a stock more attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. The implication here is that long term investors have an opportunity when expectations of a company are too low. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group We can tell from its P/E ratio of 4.99 that sentiment around American Airlines Group isn't particularly high. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (6.6) for companies in the airlines industry is higher than American Airlines Group's P/E. This suggests that market participants think American Airlines Group will underperform other companies in its industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling. Companies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell. It's nice to see that American Airlines Group grew EPS by a stonking 25% in the last year. Unfortunately, earnings per share are down 1.1% a year, over 5 years.
