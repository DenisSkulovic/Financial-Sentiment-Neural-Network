The winners and losers.,"The way markets have been acting this year, treating high-quality American assets as a haven, makes sense. But even a sensible move can reach extremes and create distortions. The trick is trying to figure out when rational activity takes conditions to a riskier place. It’s unclear we’re there yet. That’s right — even though the coronavirus outbreak upended expectations for an early-2020 economic reacceleration led by trade and manufacturing — the fact the S&P 500 is at a record high, and the manner it got there, are not illogical. Government bond yields have rushed toward last summer’s lows, investor cash has hurried into bond funds, credit markets remain generous, the U.S. economy offers more stable growth and American securities promise more secure cash flows and yield. In response to the vast uncertainty of Chinese economic performance, the U.S. has outperformed the rest of the world, and within the U.S. market, secular growth and defensive stocks have propelled the gains and had their valuations expand. The year-to-date performance of S&P 500 sectors line up just as one might expect, given these dynamics. At the top: utilities, technology, real estate and consumer discretionary. Lagging the benchmark are energy, financials (thanks to those low yields) and industrials. More thematically, the largest companies viewed as having the most reliable future growth and profitability are attracting more than their share of the world’s capital. When investors buy bonds as aggressively as they are now – with Bank of America saying last week set a record for fixed-income fund inflows – it means they are flocking to “duration,” or long-lived cash flows. Huge-cap growth stocks are, in a sense, long-duration assets as well, existing somewhere adjacent to corporate bonds on the spectrum of assets. And so, we see the liftoff of the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF versus the Global Dow. The latter is a roster of multinationals that has stalled, while the glamour stocks of the Nasdaq carry the MGK skyward. Tom Lee of FundStrat Global Advisors, says U.S. equities represent a “safety trade trifecta.” That is, the U.S. has better growth; the S&P 500 is a more growth-geared/large-cap index; and there is, in the current context, a perceived scarcity of S&P 500 market value to go around in a world of $300 trillion household liquid assets. It’s become commonplace to argue that the stock and bond markets are sending conflicting messages, with the 10-year Treasury","Feb 15, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/15/investors-are-flocking-to-the-largest-us-growth-stocks-as-concerns-rise-over-the-global-economy.html

3,American Airlines and Alaska Air Join Forces to Take On Delta | The Motley Fool,"American Airlines and Alaska Air Join Forces to Take On Delta. American Airlines is weak in the Pacific Northwest, while","   Today, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) have a common problem: Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Since 2014, Delta has built up a global hub in Seattle, gaining market share in Alaska Airlines' home city and threatening its ability to compete for corporate travel contracts there. Meanwhile, Delta has grown significantly in Los Angeles, challenging American's main West Coast hub and top transpacific gateway. Delta's joint ventures with Virgin Atlantic and Aeromexico and its planned JV with LATAM Airlines are also putting pressure on American Airlines in the U.K. and Latin America, two of the strongest points in its international route network. Now American Airlines and Alaska Airlines have realized that they would be better off teaming up to take on the threat posed by Delta's growth. On Thursday, the two airlines announced a new West Coast partnership, which will eventually include Alaska joining the oneworld global airline alliance. The late-2013 merger between AMR and US Airways made American Airlines the largest airline in the U.S. However, while American became significantly bigger than rivals Delta and United Airlines east of the Rockies, it remained the clear No. 3 player in the western U.S. AMERICAN AIRLINES' DOMESTIC ROUTE NETWORK IS CONCENTRATED EAST OF THE ROCKIES. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. This has made it hard to compete in Asia, a key growth market for American's competitors. In fact, after ending its routes from Chicago to Asia over the past year and a half, the airline is now considering whether or not to resume its flights from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai when the current coronavirus outbreak subsides. Additionally, American Airlines has trouble competing for business in the Pacific Northwest, as its hubs are poorly positioned for serving the region. By contrast, Alaska Airlines is the dominant airline in the Pacific Northwest. In Seattle, it offers about twice as many flights and seats as Delta, despite the latter's growth. It is also the leading carrier in Portland. Alaska has a substantial presence in many other West Coast markets, too. That said, with no wide-body jets to serve long-haul routes, Alaska Airlines has had to rely on a hodgepodge of international airline partners to take its customers to overseas destinations. That's given Delta a natural advantage in competing for lucrative corporate contracts from big tech companies as it has grown in Seattle.

4,China’s airlines are in a free fall | Aviation – Gulf News,. . BUSINESS. . China’s airlines are in a free fall. ALSO IN THIS PACKAGE. Grounded. Stocks swoon. TRENDING. UAE,"Passenger numbers drop will make it even more difficult to cover high fixed costs Jakarta (Bloomberg): The novel coronavirus has broadsided the aviation industry, particularly at its epicenter in China. Tens of thousands of flights in and out of the country have been canceled or removed from schedules completely as airlines cut capacity to try to survive the crisis. Big players like Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., China Southern Airlines Co. and Hainan Airlines Holding Co. have put staff on unpaid leave, while embattled Hong Kong Airlines Ltd. is axing 400 jobs. Those with weak balance-sheets are likely to face a cash crunch as dwindling passenger loads may not cover high fixed costs, though state-owned airlines should get some financial support. Nearly 86,000 domestic and international flights in and out of China were canceled from January 23 through February 11, accounting for 34 per cent of scheduled services, according to air-travel analytics company Cirium. The number of scheduled flights in the country has dropped by about 63 per cent in less than three weeks. Air Macau Co. and Cathay Dragon have the biggest proportion of their international route capacity exposed to the mainland China market, according to data from OAG Aviation Worldwide. They both have nearly 60 per cent of available seats dedicated to serve cities in China. China Southern has canceled nearly 22 per cent of its scheduled flights, according to Cirium. Xiamen Airlines Co. and Lucky Air Co., also canceled more than 20 per cebt of their flights. China’s three biggest airlines slashed international seat capacity by between 60-80 per cent from January 20 to February 10, leaving budget operator Spring Airlines Co. as the country’s largest international carrier as it only cut capacity by 6 per cent, according to OAG Aviation. Airline stocks have been weighed down by the virus, with the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index sliding 12 per cent in the past month. The “Big Three” - Air China Ltd., China Southern and China Eastern Airlines Corp. - have all plunged at least 15 per cent in Shanghai in that time. The only airline stock on the index to have risen in the past month is InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., the operator of India’s IndiGo Airlines, which has eked out a 1.4 per cent gain.

5,This 1 Aerospace Stock Can Fly Higher Than Air Canada (TSX:AC) - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . This 1 Aerospace Stock Can Fly Higher Than Air Canada (TSX:AC). Headwinds.,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | February 14, 2020 | More on: AC HRX Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) is fresh from an incredible performance in 2019, but a repeat performance is doubtful. Another name in the airline industry, however, is off to a great start and should be one of the exciting investment prospects. With the airline industry facing some headwinds lately, aerospace and defense stock Heroux-Devtek (TSX:HRX) might be a better choice than Canada’s flag carrier in 2020. Let’s see how the future stacks up for the two stocks. Air Canada is due to present its fourth quarter and full-year 2019 financial results on February 18, 2020. Last year, the company had a spectacular run, and ivestors were delighted by the 88.17% gain. Also, the first-ever TSX 30 Top Performers came out in September. As you would expect, Air Canada was among the featured growth stocks in the new recognition program. This year, however, the premier airline stock is down 6.28% year to date. Several factors are contributing to the sudden decline in investor interest. Lower oil prices should benefit the company, but Saudi Arabia seems bent on keeping prices up by making drastic cuts. Similarly, heightened travel fears are bringing down demand. Analysts are forecasting an upside of almost 43% in the next 12 months. But with fewer bookings, it might be a tall order. If the headwinds persist, Air Canada might be heading to a sharp fall in 2020. Heroux-Devtek is also operating in the airline industry but is having better traction than Air Canada to start the year. This $809.2 million provider of landing gears of planes is up 12.35% year to date. The stock’s 2019 performance was not as amazing as Air Canada, although investors are happy with the 47.71% gain. The company isn’t booking flights, nor does it deal with passengers. Heroux is into the automation and landing gear of aircrafts. It also designs, manufactures, and repairs aerospace industrial components. Heroux is the third-largest landing gear company in the world, but the most profitable. Management has been executing and integrating superbly to expand and obtain lucrative contracts. The company is supplying Airbus now after acquiring Spanish aerospace manufacturer Compañía Española de Sistemas Aeronáuticos (CESA). This largest purchase in the company’s history is the door to the European market.

Site Index,"The wide-moat firm added to its stake in Occidental Petroleum while whittling its stake in Wells Fargo. There were few surprises in wide-moat Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A)/(BRK.B) fourth-quarter 13-F filing, with the company adding to its stake in Occidental Petroleum (purchasing another 11.5 million shares for an estimated $490 million, well below the exercise price of $62.50 per share attached to the warrants Berkshire received to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental's common stock as part of its deal to help finance the oil company's purchase of Anadarko) while also continuing to whittle down its stake in Wells Fargo (selling off close to 15% of its holdings in the bank as part of ongoing moves to keep the insurer’s stake below the 10% bank holding company threshold that would invite increased regulatory oversight). As for the other purchases during the quarter, Berkshire picked up another 0.5 million shares of Restoration Hardware for an estimated $100 million, another 2.7 million shares of General Motors for an estimated $100 million, and another 4.3 million shares of Suncor Energy for an estimated $135 million. The insurer also made two new-money purchases during the period, picking up 0.6 million shares of Biogen for an estimated $170 million and 18.9 million shares of Kroger for an estimated $520 million. As for the other sales made during the period, Berkshire once again trimmed its stake in Apple (selling 3.7 million shares for an estimated $950 million), sold off close to 35% of its stake in Goldman Sachs (selling 6.3 million shares for an estimated $1.4 billion), and made small adjustments to its holdings in American Airlines, Bank of New York Mellon, and Bank of America. The insurer also came close to clearing out its small positions in Phillips 66 and The Travelers Companies, both of which we would be surprised to see still in the portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Net proceeds from the company's purchases and sales amounted to an estimated $5.2 billion, so we would expect that Berkshire's cash on hand exceeded $135 billion at the end of last year.

9,A black swan arrives: Investors keep watch as Covid-19 outbreak changes market sentiments - TODAY,"Sunday December 20, 2020. A black swan arrives: Investors keep watch as Covid-19 outbreak changes market sentiments. . STORY CONTINUES","The coronavirus outbreak has been very much in the news and, apart from its impact on public health and the economy, is also affecting investments. Investors should position their portfolio carefully and watch markets closely during this period. IMPACT ON STOCK MARKETS Concerns about the Covid-19 coronavirus in various countries continue to roil the markets with a heavy dose of volatility, financial advisory firm ETF Database observed. British newspaper The Guardian reported that financial markets remain confident the crisis will soon blow over, as share prices have been rebounding because investors think the coronavirus can be contained. Yet, it also noted that Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to insurance company Allianz, thinks that the economic damage could be a black swan event equivalent to the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market. Black swan events is a term popularised by writer Nassim Taleb and based on a saying that black swans did not exist (until they were discovered in the wild). They are events that come as a complete surprise, have profound consequences and are rationalised by people who never saw the crisis coming and who then say after the fact that it was glaringly obvious that there was trouble ahead.  The epidemic in China caused by coronavirus Covid-19 and the infections spreading in other countries have already become a black swan event for the Asia-Pacific tourism industry, business information company IHS Markit says. It could hit other sectors as well. MARKET FORECASTS While investors understandably want to know what to do at this time of uncertainty. financial advisory firm Evergreen Gavekal’s adviser Arthur Kroebel says that it is a “fool’s errand” to come up with highly specific forecasts for the ultimate impact on Chinese, regional or global gross domestic product (GDP) given the uncertainties involved. If it does turn into a global pandemic, he said, global supply chains would face more disruption, commodity prices would fall more severely, and central banks would face pressure to offset the impact.  Already, though, financial services firm ING expects that potential spreading of the virus across the globe could last until March or April and mark a new downside risk to the global economy in the first half of 2020. Investment bank JP Morgan said that the coronavirus remains in its early stages and “is likely to worsen before getting better”.

10,"Delta Air Lines employees bask in profit-sharing , but not all benefit","Delta employees welcome Valentine’s Day bonus, but not everyone profits. In Other News","  Valentine’s Day is extra special at Delta Air Lines. The Atlanta-based carrier will pay a $1.6 billion profit-sharing bonus on Friday  to its roughly 90,000 employees — about two months' worth of pay. It's the sixth straight year Delta is giving an annual bonus, and up from $1.3 billion last year. Average pay at Delta outside the cockpit is also roughly 15% to 20% higher than for metro Atlantans. Include pilots, and it’s about double the city’s average. Not everyone is happy, though. About 90,000 contract workers who aren't direct employees won't be getting the bonus. Such workers help push Delta passengers in wheelchairs, operate Delta Connection regional flights and at some airports check in Delta customers and handle their baggage. It’s also unclear if Delta employees earn more — or even as much — as employees at other major U.S. airlines that are more unionized, when benefits are included. That’s even after including Delta’s bonus, the largest in the industry.  And there’s the question of whether employees would be better off with higher base pay than waiting on an unpredictable bonus that may or may not arrive in any given year. “Profit sharing is really two-edged, and it receives different reviews depending on where you stand,” said Donald Maliniak, an airline labor law expert who teaches labor law at the University of Mississippi. If the company is not profitable, “I can do my job as best as I can do it and still not get” that bonus, he noted. Delta is planning a surprise for employees at an event in a hangar at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Friday. In past years, the company put up a giant greeting card on its campus, gave out puzzle pieces to employees made from the skin of a Delta Boeing 747, and had celebrities and executives thank each employee by name over 50 hours on Facebook Live. Meanwhile, catering workers plan to hold protests at Delta airport hubs around the country Friday amid an airline contractor labor dispute. The Association of Flight Attendants plans to relay a ""If you like it, lock it in"" message to Delta flight attendants the same day, pitching the benefits of collective bargaining as part of its unionization push at the airline. Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, makes a distinction between contractors who provide services for Delta and Delta employees.

Online investment platform Rally Road has partnered with luxury reseller Privé Porter to allow people to invest in rare and new Birkin handbags. The partnership will make partial ownership of what is deemed a pinnacle of affluence more accessible to the general public.   ""People are always going to be buying and selling Birkin bags, and the concept of Rally is to not have that go away,"" Rob Petrozzo, cofounder of Rally, told Business Insider.

16,5 Blue Chip Stocks in Wall Street’s Penalty Box Have Massive Upside Potential – 24/7 Wall St.,. . . . . 5 Blue Chip Stocks in Wall Street's Penalty Box Have Massive Upside Potential. Boeing. Exxon.,"In an overbought and frothy stock market, sometimes the hardest thing for dedicated stock investors to do is to head to the sideline, and with good reason. While the longest peacetime expansion and the corresponding almost 11-year bull market have been outstanding for those who were in the whole time, there is always a chance there is another 5% upside before a blow-off top. The question is, given all the current financial jitters and with the potential for the coronavirus to explode, what stocks make sense now? Using a somewhat contrarian stance, but acknowledging that it’s always darkest before the dawn, we found five top companies that are rated Buy at major firms, are very well known, and have been tossed into the Wall Street penalty box. Like in the National Hockey League, they will not be let out until the penalty time is served. While not suitable for very conservative accounts, they all make sense for investors who have a long-term view on the markets and can wait out the current issues in an effort to see some big-time returns. This company has had a public relations nightmare due to the 737 Max issues. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) is the world’s leading aerospace company and the largest manufacturer of commercial jetliners and military aircraft combined. It is also one of the most valuable brands in the world. The different segments in the company are Commercial Airplanes, Boeing Defense, Space & Security and Boeing Capital. The latter provides financial solutions facilitating sale and delivery of Boeing commercial and military aircraft, satellites and launch vehicles. In 2018, Boeing and Embraer signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to create a new strategic partnership for commercial aviation. The new joint venture is valued at $4.75 billion, which values Boeing’s 80% share at $3.8 billion.
