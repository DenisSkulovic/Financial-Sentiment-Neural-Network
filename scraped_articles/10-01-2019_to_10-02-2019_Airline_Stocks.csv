0,European Airlines Stocks Soar as Bank Predicts Sector Is Set to Take Off | Barron's,European Airlines Stocks Soar as Bank Predicts Sector Is Set to Take Off. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily. . .,"  A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.  European airline stocks soared on Tuesday after a bullish Bank of America Merrill Lynch note on the sector. The bank’s strategists said European airlines were priced for an outright euro-zone recession, which they said was unlikely. The Stoxx Europe Airline index climbed 1.4%, with Ryanair Holdings (ticker: RYA.UK) leading the way, jumping 2.2%. Air France-KLM (AF.France) lifted 2.2%, travel operator and airline TUI (TUI.UK) rose 1.3%, easyJet (EZJ.UK) gained 1.6%, and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines (IAG.UK) edged 0.5% higher. The back story. European airlines have underperformed throughout 2019, facing intense competition,
rising fuel prices, and the grounding of
Boeing’s 737 MAX jet.   A number of strikes and air-traffic-control issues have also had an adverse impact, and the wider euro-zone economy has slowed amid global trade tensions and fears of a no-deal Brexit. Euro-area new orders in manufacturing and services fell 1.7 points in September to 48.8—into negative territory. The common currency bloc’s manufacturing sector had its worst month in seven years in September. What’s new. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Tuesday it expected an upturn in the European economy, which would lift stocks. The bank’s strategists said airlines would soar particularly high as they were already priced for a recession and higher oil prices. They said euro-area PMI momentum—defined as the six-month change in the new-orders component of manufacturing and services data—to return to positive territory in the near term and stay there. “European airlines are already priced for the PMI at 46, thus discounting an outright euro area recession,” the strategists wrote. “Alternatively, the price of Brent crude would have to rise to $95 per barrel to justify airlines’ price relative to the market. We think neither of those assumptions is likely to materialize.” They predicted a 19% upside for airlines, sending the entire sector higher on Tuesday. They said airlines had underperformed 30% since the start of the year, which was the “sharpest and most prolonged underperformance” over the past 15 years. Moving forward. European airline stocks have had a turbulent year, but BofA Merrill Lynch believes the market has priced them far too low. Airlines have the largest overweight rating in the bank’s European allocation, and the bank predicts a large upside if the economy picks up.

US airline stocks plummet after Trump wins WTO approval for tariffs on aircraft parts (UAL, LUV, AAL, DAL). SHARE","   Flickr via Charman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Major US airlines saw their stocks tumble Wednesday after President Trump won approval from the World Trade Organization for $7.5 billion worth of tariffs on EU-based airplane parts and luxury goods. The approval is the largest in the WTO's 24-year history, nearly doubling the previous record from 2002. The tariffs affect the decades-long conflict between US-based Boeing and EU-based Airbus, with both companies accused of illegally using government funds to compete with the other.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Mamta Badkar in New York Airline stocks had their wings clipped on Wednesday after the World Trade Organization on Wednesday cleared the way for the US to impose tariffs on European goods as part in a long-running Airbus dispute. Delta Air Lines fell nearly 5 per cent to $54.33, while United Airlines fell 4.7 per cent to $83.69. American Airlines tumbled 5.3 per cent to $25.37 and Alaska Air fell 3.5 per cent to $62.69. The broader NYSE Arca Airline index fell 2.4 per cent. The WTO’s decision authorises almost $7.5bn in annual punitive levies to repair damage done to Boeing by illegal EU aid to Airbus. But the ruling leaves US carriers vulnerable to tariff hikes as most major American carriers have orders placed with Airbus. Delta said in a statement that aircraft purchases require a long lead time for production and that “imposing tariffs on aircraft that US companies have already committed to will inflict serious harm on US airlines, the millions of Americans they employ and the travelling public.” The carrier added that the “unexpected tax hike” would also lower the carrier’s profit and said even if it could escape its contractual commitments Boeing lacks the capacity to produce and deliver additional aircraft to Delta in the same timeframe. The sell-off in airline stocks also came on an ugly day for global stocks as disappointing economic data renewed concerns about global growth and Brexit woes added to the risk-off trade.

3,ESG Investing: Is Southwest Airlines a Responsible Investment? | The Motley Fool,"ESG Investing: Is Southwest Airlines a Responsible Investment?. Before you make up your mind to avoid airline stocks, see how","   The airline industry isn't the first place an investor might think to go in search of a company that scores well on environmental, social, and governance issues. Many environmental advocates view global air travel's enormous carbon footprint as needlessly wasteful, and amid numerous bankruptcies and consumer protection failures among major airlines throughout the industry's history, employees and customers alike have often found their lives disrupted. Yet within the industry, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has long stood out from the crowd. The airline looks a lot different than it did back in the early 1970s, when Southwest took advantage of a gap in federal regulatory coverage to offer intrastate air travel between key cities within the state of Texas. Once airline deregulation became reality, Southwest began to broaden its scope, moving first to serve key U.S. markets outside Texas and then looking beyond the nation's borders. Currently, Southwest helps travelers visit more than 100 destinations in the U.S. along with 10 countries internationally. Key cities include Chicago, Baltimore, Las Vegas, Denver, and Southwest's home market in Dallas. Southwest now counts itself among the top airlines in the nation, and it’s No. 11 on Fortune’s list of the World’s Most Admired Companies in 2019. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST. Southwest has embraced ESG principles throughout its history, even before most investors paid much attention to those concepts as being critically valuable to a company's long-term business prospects. The company's efforts to embrace its employee base date back to its origins. Southwest's more recent efforts to modernize its aircraft fleet to become more fuel-efficient have aimed at the joint goals of cutting costs and reducing environmental impact. Those types of initiatives are exactly what ESG investors like to see, because they show that investing with ESG principles in mind doesn't have to be inconsistent with traditional work to maximize profits. The recent death of co-founder Herb Kelleher was a sad occasion for Southwest, as the airline's former CEO stood as an example for airline employees to give their best and always try to put passengers first. But the awareness of Kelleher's legacy at the airline has given current Southwest employees new inspiration to keep the spirit of what he helped to build alive and well for generations to come. Let's analyze Southwest using The Motley Fool's 10-question ESG framework. Yes. Southwest expresses its mission simply: putting people first.

4,Why Shares of American Airlines Group Are Descending Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of American Airlines Group Are Descending Today. Fears of a slowdown sent shareholders running for the exits.. What,"   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) fell more than 6% on Wednesday after a rival warned that costs were coming in higher than expected. American is widely viewed as the most vulnerable of the major U.S. airlines, and investors have recently been heading for the emergency exits at the first sign of trouble. Before markets opened on Wednesday, American rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) warned that third-quarter non-fuel costs would be up 2.5% year over year -- an increase from initial guidance for a 1% to 2% gain -- due to higher employee costs, weather, and record passenger volumes. Delta also said it now expects full-year 2019 non-fuel costs to be up 2%, versus a previous forecast for a rise of about 1%. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP. Though Delta's news didn't directly impact American, the latter airline has given investors plenty of reasons to be concerned. American is carrying more debt than its peers, and faces labor unrest from its mechanics and other employees.  AIRLINE DEBT TO ASSETS (QUARTERLY) DATA BY YCHARTS. It was also relying on Boeing's troubled 737 MAX for growth, and could face additional issues from that plane's grounding. Reuters reported on Tuesday that American's pilots would seek compensation for pay lost to canceled 737 flights. The pilot request could either inflate costs at American, or put the airline at risk of inflaming tensions with another important labor group. American does have disadvantages compared to some of its key rivals, and given the airline industry's history of destroying equity value during downturns, it's understandable that investors are getting nervous about the company. But American is far from a lost cause. The airline is well-positioned to weather the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute thanks to cutbacks announced last year, and it's in the early stages of implementing changes to its route network and pricing strategies designed to improve profitability. American is also forecasting that capital expenditures will come down in the next few years, which should free up cash to accelerate debt repayment. Given the overall uncertainty of the economy and American's near-term disadvantages, now isn't an ideal time to climb on board, especially with better buys like Delta also trading down. But over the long run, American seems likely to navigate through these storm clouds.    Before you consider American Airlines Group Inc., you'll want to hear this.

5,interactive investor,Why there's big potential upside for the airlines sector,"Share on: After suffering significant share price declines, all the bad news is in the price for these carriers.
  Shares in International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG), Ryanair (LSE:RYA), easyJet (LSE:EZJ) and Wizz Air (LSE:WIZZ) have been cleared for take-off by a leading City bank after its analysts backed the European airlines sector to ride out the current Brexit and economy-related turbulence. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's 'overweight' coverage of European airlines reflects its belief that the market has gone too far in pricing stocks for an outright recession on the continent. They don't subscribe to this economic scenario, meaning there's a big potential upside for the sector should key indicators turn positive as they expect in the coming months. And with the basket of European airline stocks down by roughly 30% so far this year, the analysts regard now as an opportune time to gain exposure to high quality companies with strong balance sheets, such as British Airways owner IAG or Ryanair. European airline price/earnings (PE) multiples are now 15% lower on average over the past year and trading at about 7.5x 2020 earnings — a discount to global airlines. The note said: ""Although a worsening macro outlook is a headwind, we think this is reflected in shares with valuations at historical lows."" It's why the broker rates IAG, Ryanair and Wizz Air as a 'buy', with price targets of 660p (currently 482p), €13.5 (€10.91) and 4,100p (3,674p) respectively.  Orange-liveried easyJet is rated 'neutral', with price target of 1,200p (1,172p). Source: TradingView Past performance is not a guide to future performance While the London-listed quartet face potential disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit on October 31, Bank of America said the airlines had taken steps to ensure they maintain their EU operating licences by restricting ownership by non-EU nationals. The bank notes that the UK represents the highest percentage of revenue for easyJet at 44%, followed by IAG at 32% and Ryanair with 22%. This makes them most exposed to a UK recession in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but a weaker pound is also likely to drive higher tourism to the UK and represent a positive for air travel demand. Other Brexit factors to consider will be the translation of sales into euros, which will impact all but easyJet, as well as the potential disruption to travel trends caused by visa issues.

Here’s how the broad indexes fared for those three months and the first three quarters of 2019, along with long-term returns: The financial media and many professional investors agree that we are at a late stage for the bull market that (arguably) started at the post-financial-crisis bottom on March 9, 2009. One sign of a frothy market is the seemingly new perception that assumptions about valuations for certain startup companies have been fantastic.

7,A Gamble to Reshape the Global Airline Industry - WSJ,The Wall Street Journal. A Gamble to Reshape the Global Airline Industry. Delta will pay a steep premium for a,"  Do airlines actually benefit from global alliances like SkyTeam and Oneworld? Delta just bet $2.3 billion they don’t. Last week, Delta Air Lines DAL -1.05% said it would buy a 20% stake in Chilean carrier Latam Airlines, likely becoming the main shareholder in Latin America’s largest carrier. This adds to a patchwork of equity-backed partnerships stitched by Delta in recent years, including 49% ownership of both Aeromexico and U.K.-based Virgin Atlantic, stakes in China Eastern CEA 0.04% and Korean Air, and joint ventures with Virgin Australia, Canada’s WestJet and Air France-KLM AFLYY -2.54% plus Alitalia Collaboration between airlines in different regions is common in the form of codeshares and alliances. Latam is in the Oneworld alliance with American Airlines and British Airways, which it will now leave. But Delta’s move looks to be part of a more ambitious plan to scrap alliances in favor of a new, deeper model of international integration. The gamble may pay off, but it is a risky one. Delta will pay $1.9 billion for its Latam shares—78% above market value—using cash and new debt, and invest $350 million in the partnership. The steep premium for a minority stake is particularly surprising given that Latam’s anchor shareholders from the Cueto family seem eager to leave the company. Earlier this month, Enrique Cueto announced he would be stepping down as chief executive after 25 years. For Delta, meanwhile, the outlay is close to its entire free cash flow for the year through June. A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data. The news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.  Moreover, Latam doesn’t make much money. Many airlines have invested in Latin America with an eye on its strong passenger growth, but low-cost competition and currency crises made it the least profitable market per passenger last year, according to the International Air Transport Association. Yet the purchase of Latam may make sense in the context of a global network strategy. While American and United Airlines are preoccupied with weak profitability and domestic expansion, respectively, Delta has a window of opportunity to bolster its position abroad. The Atlanta-based carrier has signaled that the deal is above all about expanding its frequent flier program and premium-cabin strategy. These are huge money spinners for Delta on U.S. and trans-Atlantic flights, thanks to better passenger segmentation and co-branding partnerships with credit-card providers.","Oct 1, 2019",https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-gamble-to-reshape-the-global-airline-industry-11569922330

9,Have Insiders Been Selling Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Shares? - Simply Wall St News,Have Insiders Been Selling Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Shares?. What Is Insider Selling?. Southwest Airlines Insider Transactions Over The Last,"We've lost count of how many times insiders have accumulated shares in a company that goes on to improve markedly. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV). Most investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market. We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year. Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Director, John Montford, sold US$50k worth of shares at a price of US$51.27 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$53.37. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 4.8% of John Montford's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was John Montford. John Montford sold a total of 1936 shares over the year at an average price of US$51.80. The chart below shows insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year.

By: Josiah Wilmoth | Email | Leave a comment As the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s losses snowballed on Wednesday, President Donald Trump scrambled to identify a scapegoat. Today’s stock market antagonist? Congressional Democrats and their “impeachment nonsense.” Trump made the revelation on Twitter, as the Dow spiraled toward a 500-point meltdown and the S&P 500 cratered below its 100-day moving average (DMA). At last check, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had plummeted 485.01 points or 1.83%, reducing the DJIA to 26,088.03. At its session low, the Dow came within 35.18 points of breaching the 26,000 level. In his tweet, Trump railed against impeachment-minded Democrats, accusing them of purposely hurting the country and driving the stock market down to hinder his reelection chances in 2020. “All of this impeachment nonsense, which is going nowhere, is driving the Stock Market, and your 401K’s, down. But that is exactly what the Democrats want to do,” Trump seethed. “They are willing to hurt the Country, with only the 2020 Election in mind!” All of this impeachment nonsense, which is going nowhere, is driving the Stock Market, and your 401K’s, down. But that is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They are willing to hurt the Country, with only the 2020 Election in mind! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019  Most market analysts have a different read on today’s downturn, which piled onto Tuesday’s 343.79 point drawdown – the DJIA’s worst pullback in more than a month.

15,Japan Airlines and Amadeus expand partnership to deliver new benefits for both airlines and travel sellers｜JAL Group - Press Release,. . . . . Press Release. Japan Airlines and Amadeus expand partnership to deliver new benefits for both airlines," With Amadeus becoming JAL’s recommended distribution partner, Amadeus travel agents in Japan will now have access to JAL’s complete range of travel offers and be able to better serve travellers thanks to the Altéa common platform   As Japan Airlines (JAL) takes the next step in its global growth strategy, the airline and Amadeus announce today a reinforced partnership with an extended distribution and IT agreement. Through this agreement, JAL will benefit from enhanced technology as Amadeus becomes JAL’s recommended distribution partner in the Japanese market. This comes just five years after the airline migrated to Amadeus’ full Altéa Suite for reservations, inventory and departure control modules, back in 2014. With this latest agreement, Amadeus’ global network of travel sellers will have access to a broader range of JAL’s content, including the full range of international, as well as preferred and negotiated fares. All of this content will be available for travel sellers to shop, book and service through the Amadeus Travel Platform.   In addition, because JAL relies on Amadeus’ passenger service system, Amadeus-connected travel agents will enjoy real-time, accurate and efficient information sharing with complete visibility of the airline’s inventory; all designed to enable travel sellers to deliver even greater customer service.  “With this new agreement, we’re aiming to differentiate our travel offers based on value rather than just price. We want to make sure that travel agencies have all the information they need to make the right purchasing decisions, and we can exceed travelers’ expectations throughout their journey. We believe that Amadeus provides the best technology for agents to book and retail Japan Airlines’ travel offers and have therefore chosen Amadeus as our recommended partner,” says Yoriyuki Kashiwagi, Executive Officer, International Passenger Sales of Japan Airlines. “We’re committed to support JAL’s commercial strategy by empowering travelers with transparency and personalization. In a competitive marketplace, airlines are looking for simple, open, and agile technology that enables them to deliver the travel experiences their customers expect, and that’s what we do best,” says Julia Sattel, President, Airlines, Amadeus. “We recognize that Japan has a unique profile of travel agencies, which gives rise to specific requirements and expectations. This is exactly why we have evolved the Amadeus Travel Platform, so that all of our customers can access more content, via multiple channels and devices. Partnering with JAL to become its recommended distribution partner is a testament","Oct 2, 2019",https://press.jal.co.jp/en/release/201910/005337.html
16,International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) Takes On Some Risk With Its Use Of Debt - Simply Wall St News,International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) Takes On Some Risk With Its Use Of Debt. When Is Debt A Problem?. What,"Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (LON:IAG) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky. Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. View our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that International Consolidated Airlines Group had €1.56b of debt in June 2019, down from €7.43b, one year before. But on the other hand it also has €7.99b in cash, leading to a €6.43b net cash position. Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that International Consolidated Airlines Group had liabilities of €14.8b due within 12 months and liabilities of €14.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had €7.99b in cash and €2.21b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by €19.3b. This deficit casts a shadow over the €10.6b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. After all, International Consolidated Airlines Group would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today. Given that International Consolidated Airlines Group has more cash than debt, we're pretty confident it can handle its debt, despite the fact that it has a lot of liabilities in total. Fortunately, International Consolidated Airlines Group grew its EBIT by 6.5% in the last year,","Oct 2, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/transportation/lse-iag/international-consolidated-airlines-group-shares/news/international-consolidated-airlines-group-loniag-takes-on-some-risk-with-its-use-of-debt
17,Shanghai-London Stock Connect Sees Its Second IPO | 09 | 2019 | Publications | Insights & Publications | Debevoise & Plimpton LLP,. Shanghai-London Stock Connect Sees Its Second IPO. Practices. Regions. Authors:,"INTRODUCTION China Pacific Insurance, the first insurance company to be listed in Shanghai, Hong Kong and London, is set to become the second Chinese company to list global depositary receipts (“GDRs”) on the London Stock Exchange (the “LSE”) under the recently established Shanghai-London Stock Connect (“Stock Connect”) scheme. The listing represents the latest example of a trend for Chinese companies to seek an LSE listing, and thereby obtaining greater access to the international investor pool. Huatai Securities became the first Chinese company to list on the LSE under the Stock Connect scheme in June 2019 with its US$1.54 billion raising through the sale of its GDRs. Stock Connect is a new scheme launched on 17 June 2019 connecting the LSE with the Shanghai Stock Exchange (the “SSE”) so that companies listed on one market may now issue, list and trade depositary receipts on the other market. The initiative marks a clear relaxation of the Chinese domestic restrictions, allowing non-Chinese companies to trade under Chinese national rules for the first time. Stock Connect has also opened up an opportunity for Chinese companies to reach out to a new pool of investors in London. Currently, there are only five Chinese companies listed on the Main Market of the LSE, including Air China, one of the major Chinese airline companies, oil and gas company China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, and infrastructure company Zhejiang Expressway. The scheme is available to “westbound businesses” – namely, companies listed on the SSE which issue GDRs on the relevant segment of the LSE, and to “eastbound businesses” – LSE-listed companies issuing so called “Chinese depositary receipts” (“CDRs”) on the SSE Main Board. CDRs and GDRs are fungible with the securities they represent, being exchanged by a limited number of designated brokers from both markets. Historically, companies listed on the SSE have struggled to tap into foreign capital pools due to a number of barriers that apply to non-China residents seeking to invest directly in SSE-listed securities, including the need to qualify as a “Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor” or “RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor”. As a result of the new initiative, Shanghai-listed companies will now have greater access to foreign investors who are looking to benefit from the growth of Chinese companies, and can raise funds by trading their GDRs admitted to trading on the Stock Connect segment of the Main Market of the LSE.

By using the site, you consent to the placement of these cookies. Read our privacy policy to learn more. Q. What happened to Excel's ability to import stock prices? That functionality seems to have vanished. A. Many CPAs treasured the ability to link real-time stock prices in Excel, but Microsoft removed this functionality a couple of years ago, reportedly because it was not fully compatible with Office 365. I'm happy to report that Microsoft has now brought back real-time stock prices, but they are available only in Office 365, and the steps for creating such a link are different, as illustrated in the following simple example. I entered the ticker symbol DAL (for Delta Air Lines Inc.) in cell A3, and with cell A3 selected, from the Data tab I selected Stocks from the Data Types group, and then Delta Air Lines Inc from the resulting Data Selector dialog box, as pictured below. These actions create a live link between your workbook and the Nasdaq exchange database, which includes information from all the major U.S. stock indexes. Next, in cell B3, I began writing the formula =A3, which pops up a list of available stock data field names that I can insert in my workbook, a partial list of which is pictured below. Finally, I simply selected a field name (Price in this example) and pressed Enter to link the current Delta Air Lines stock price ($58.54 in this example) to my workbook. You can see the resulting formula in cell B3, which returns the current stock price for Delta, is =A3.price. This functionality works even better when an Excel Table is involved, as follows. With my cursor positioned in cell A1, I inserted a table from the Insert tab by selecting Table and clicking OK to create a table in cells A1:A2. Next, I typed the two column heading names Company and Price in cells A1 and B1, respectively (in this example, my table area expanded automatically to include column B as I entered the column B name). Next, I increased the column width of column A by about 200%, and in cell A2, I entered MSFT (the ticker symbol for Microsoft) and then clicked the Stocks icon on the Data tab, as pictured","Oct 1, 2019",https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2019/oct/excel-real-time-stock-prices.html
