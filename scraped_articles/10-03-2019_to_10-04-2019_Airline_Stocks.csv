CNBC Newsletters","Airlines stocks are in a tailspin this week. United Airlines, Delta, JetBlue and American Airlines have all fallen sharply in the past week as the rest of the transports stocks tumbled. The group also dropped Thursday after the U.S. moved to issue tariffs on Airbus planes. One name may have fallen too far, too fast, according to JC O’Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners. “The weakness is widespread and over the last few days that weakness has really started to accelerate, but one stock really jumped out at us and that was American because the chart is actually so bad, we question is it actually good,” O’Hara said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” Since the beginning of 2018, American Airlines has fallen from a high of $59 to a low of $24. It now sits at a critical level, O’Hara said. “We call this last-chance support because this is exactly where the price rallied in 2013, again in 2016 we had a strong bounce off that $24 level,” he said. “This could have a chance to bounce here.” However, if it fails at this level, there will be a lot more pain in American’s future, he added. “We say last-chance support because if we break $24, there’s no technical levels to stop the decline so very, very key area right here,” O’Hara said.  Mark Tepper, CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, is sticking with a different airline stock. “I still like Delta here. I mean this thing is just way oversold. It has come back maybe 20% or so from its peak a few months ago,” Tepper said during the same segment. Delta is one of the worst performers this week. However, it is one of the best performers over the past 12 months. Tepper said the Atlanta-based carrier is the best in show for three reasons. “No. 1, they don’t have any 737 Max exposure so they have the ability to increase capacity while none of their competitors can do the same. Second thing is they do have the best maintenance team in the industry and that helps them to extend the useful lives of their aircraft which helps margins,” he said. “The third thing is their partnership with American Express is the gold standard, and it literally delivers cash straight to their bottom line while smoothing out the cyclical nature of their business.” He adds that Delta’s","Oct 4, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/04/american-airlines-looks-so-bad-its-good-technician-says.html

Healthcare stock picks from Mackie RBC, BlackBerry Wishpond begins trading    Canadian airline stocks are like their peers everywhere else; cyclical and highly regulated. It’s one of the sectors that causes a tonne of consternation among investors. Airlines, it is said, are blessed with the potential for huge growth but cursed in a number of ways, chief among them being their exposure to externalities such as the fluctuating price of oil, the constant to-and-fro-ing with labour unions and a highly competitive environment. You can add to that mix some contemporary concerns such as signs of a slowing economy, the volatility created by the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jets and the ensuing capacity problems and spiking insurance premiums. Finally, for Canadian investors, a major shake-up this year in Canada’s airline space should be noted, with not one but two major deals emerging — Air Canada’s purchase of Transat and Onex’s deal for WestJet. But, fear not, there is still money to be made in the sector. That’s according to the following three experts whose bullish opinions have been recently reviewed by Cantech Letter. Air Canada (Air Canada Stock Quote, Chart, News TSX:AC)  To those of us who were prescient enough to buy up Air Canada in the early 2010s, back when the company was on the verge of collapse at the stock was essentially pennies, we salute your moxie. AC’s turnaround in recent years has been a sight to behold, going from debt-laden to fabulously profitable and lifting its share price to record highs this year. But there’s still upside to the name, according to analyst Corey Hammill of Paradigm Capital. Hammill says that Air Canada beat his estimates in its latest quarter and pointed out that the Boeing 737 issue is just a little turbulence for AC. “Despite the current headwinds resulting from the continued grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, we remain upbeat in our outlook for AC and believe that a multiple expansion is more than overdue. The Max grounding exemplifies how Air Canada’s business has been built to withstand various unforeseen shocks and still deliver strong profits,” writes Hammill in a July 31 report to clients. “The current spread between AC and U.S. legacy carriers based on 2019 consensus EBITDA estimates is ~1 multiple point, with AC trading","Oct 4, 2019",https://www.cantechletter.com/2019/10/three-canadian-airline-stocks-that-could-fly/

Barron's Tech.,"  A weekly guide to our best stories on technology, disruption, and the people and stocks in the middle of it all.  One analyst says buy airline shares. Another one says sell. Wall Street appears confused
. Yet differing views among firms aren’t all that uncommon. Reconciling them is simply a matter of your time horizon.  On Thursday, Buckingham Research analyst Daniel McKenzie downgraded shares of Delta Air Lines (ticker: DAL) from the equivalent of Buy to Hold and slashed his price target from $74 to $58, just 10% higher than recent levels. Delta shares were down 2.4%, at $53.04, in recent trading. “With or without a recession, shares are likely to re-rate lower for longer on [fourth quarter] cost pressures annualizing into 2020,” McKenzie wrote in a Thursday research report. He worries that a slowing economy will hurt Delta earnings. His fears were likely stoked Wednesday, when Delta stock tumbled 4.7% after the company updated its quarterly guidance
. Delta said it expects earnings per share between $2.20 and $2.30, narrowing its previous $2.10 to $2.40 range; the consensus estimate was $2.26.  The trim wasn’t all that bad, but recession fears pounded the market
, driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.9%. Economically sensitive air carriers fell even more, with airline stocks in the S&P 500 dropping 4.1% Wednesday.  J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker published a research report Thursday updating his 2021 earnings estimates for the sector. He recommends buying Delta and has a $78 price target, 48% higher than recent levels. Delta stock is trading at just 6.4 times Baker’s 2021 earnings-per-share estimate, and his target price implies the valuation multiple reaches 9.5 times earnings. “We apply a higher multiple for Delta relative to United—8.5 times—and American—6.6 times—given Delta’s leading financial output in its legacy airline peer set,” he explains. Baker also has Buy ratings on Alaska Air Group (ALK), American Airlines Group (AAL), United Airlines Holdings (UAL), and Spirit Airlines (SAVE). He rates JetBlue Airways (JBLU) a Hold and recommends selling Southwest Airlines (LUV). On balance, he appears bullish on the sector, arguing that owning a few better-managed carriers cuts some of its historic risks. “Our revised [Delta] target price is based on shares trading at 8.5 times...our 2019 earnings per share,” writes McKenzie. “The trim to our multiple reflects our view of a downward bias to earnings—until we get more macro clarity.” This","Oct 3, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-delta-stock-or-sell-it-the-answer-depends-on-your-time-horizon-51570126336
3,Airline Stocks: US Levies 10% Tariffs on Airbus Aircraft,Airline Stocks: US Levies 10% Tariffs on Airbus Aircraft. Airline stocks in focus. Risks could grow for airlines,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Airline stocks could be in focus today, as the Trump administration has levied a hefty tariff on European-made Airbus aircraft. The latest move came after the WTO (World Trade Organization) ruled in the US’s favor in a 15-year old dispute regarding Airbus. Yesterday morning, the WTO found the EU guilty of providing unfair subsidies to the European planemaker. The ruling paved the way for the US to quickly impose tariffs on European-made goods worth $7.5 billion. Yesterday, Reuters reported the government had released a list of hundreds of European commodities that will be tariffed. Washington has imposed 25% import duties on Italian cheese, single malt whisky, and French wine. The list also includes UK-made blankets and German camera parts. However, the main target was Airbus aircraft. The US government is enforcing a 10% duty on aircraft imported from Airbus’s European facilities. The new tariffs on European products are set to take effect on October 18. The tariffs could severely hurt US airlines, as they’re set to make Airbus planes costlier. Most US carriers have pending Airbus orders worth billions of dollars. As of August 31, Delta Air Lines (DAL) had 254 unfulfilled orders with the European aircraft manufacturer. Meanwhile, American Airlines (AAL) is awaiting 114 Airbus deliveries. United Airlines (UAL) and JetBlue (JBLU) have 45 and 154 unfulfilled orders, respectively. Therefore, airlines were the most beaten-down stocks during yesterday’s sell-off after the WTO’s ruling. With a 5.3% intraday decline, American Airlines plunged the most. United followed, falling 4.7%. Delta and JetBlue closed 4.7% and 2.5% lower, respectively. The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 235 points, or 2.3%, yesterday. All 20 of its components closed in the red. The tariffs on European-made aircraft put US airlines at more risk. Together, Airbus and Boeing (BA) hold over 90% of the commercial airplane manufacturing space. As Airbus planes become more expensive, US airlines could have less bargaining power with Boeing. The WTO also found the US guilty in a similar case the EU filed regarding Boeing. The final ruling could come in early January, and it looks like it could be in the EU’s favor. Therefore, the EU could retaliate with levying hefty charges on US-made goods. Following the WTO ruling, European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström said, “If the U.S. decides to impose WTO authorized countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have","Oct 3, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/10/airline-stocks-us-levies-tariffs-airbus-aircraft/
4,Delta’s stock drops after analyst downgrades on cost and pricing concerns - MarketWatch,MarketWatch Site Logo A link that brings you back to the homepage. .mwA1{fill:#ffffff;} .mwA2{fill:#4db74d;}. The Ratings Game. Delta’s stock drops,"Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc. dropped for a fifth-straight session Thursday, after Buckingham Research downgraded the air carrier, citing concerns that cost and pricing pressures will carry over into next year, suggesting Wall Street expectations are “too aggressive.” Analyst Daniel McKenzie said a “lumpy” seat supply outlook, tied to uncertainty over when Boeing Co.’s 737 Max planes return to service, and an increasingly uncertain economic outlook, which is starting to negatively affect business travel plans, would indicate pricing is going to be “challenged” next year. McKenzie cut his rating on Delta’s stock to neutral, after being at buy for at least the past three years. He slashed his price target to $58 from $74, which is now the lowest among the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet. The downgrade comes after Delta provided a third-quarter update on Wednesday, in which EPS guidance was in line with expectations but the growth outlook for non-fuel unit costs increased to 2.5% from 1% to 2%. Delta shares DAL, -1.05%  shed 3.1% in afternoon trading toward a four-month low. That was enough to pace the decliners in the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -0.58%  , which includes six airlines among its components. (Read more about Delta’s stock chart below.) The stock has shed 10% over the past five sessions, to trade 17% below its July record close of $63.16. It is now on track to suffer the second losing streak of at least five days in a month, and third this year. McKenzie also lowered his 2020 earnings-per-share estimate $6.80 from $7.90, which is now below the FactSet EPS consensus of $7.07, while his revenue estimate of $47.91 billion is below consensus of $48.60 billion. He expects costs per available seat mile excluding fuel to rise 3.5% in 2020, above Delta’s view of flat to up 2%, given an open pilots contract. “What’s changed: Margin expansion in our model now falls to margin contraction on 2020 cost and revenue pressures, hence the 13% cut to our 2020 pre-tax outlook, lower valuation and downgrade,” McKenzie wrote in a note to clients. “And the bias is to the downside given that we’re not factoring in an economic downturn (much less a hard Brexit).” He said pricing is out of Delta’s control for next year, that industry capacity is likely to rise as 737 Max planes return to service.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   The World Trade Organization (WTO) recently announced a ruling in favor of the U.S. administration, allowing it to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European products beginning Oct 18. This followed WTO’s finding that the European Union has been providing illegal subsidies to Airbus, violating fair trade practices.

Following the imposition, the European Union will face a 10% import tax on aircraft and a 25% tariff on goods ranging from agricultural items to industrial goods, per a Bloomberg report.

How Did the News Impact Airline Stocks?

Stocks of major U.S.-based airlines witnessed a steep fall post the decision. This is evident from the chart given below, which shows that shares of Delta Air Lines DAL had plunged the maximum at 7.3%. Shares
of American Airlines, the world’s largest airline, AAL fell 5.7%, while United Airlines UAL lost 5.2%.  
Why Airlines Stocks Are Likely to be Hit

Over the past seven months, many U.S.-based airlines shifted to Airbus due to issues with Boeing's BA 737 Max aircraft grounding. Currently, most U.S.-based airlines have pending orders with the European aircraft giant.

In June 2019, American Airlines placed orders for Airbus’ 50 A321XLR aircraft. At the end of August, American Airlines had a total of 114 aircraft units, which are yet to be delivered by Airbus. During the same month, Delta Air Lines placed orders for five additional A220-100 aircraft. The company, as of Aug 31, awaits the delivery of 254 aircraft from Airbus. Another U.S. airline, United Airlines, currently awaits the delivery of 45 aircraft from Airbus.

Per a recent report by Reuters, the Trump administration plans to impose a 10% tariff on Airbus production facilities located in Spain, Germany, France and Britain, which manufacture large civil and passenger aircraft. This will bump up costs of Airbus’ aircraft, raising the possibility that many airline companies will shift to Boeing as an immediate alternative.

The WTO ruling has spooked investors, driving them away from U.S. airline stocks which in turn is reflecting on their share prices.

6,Why Shares of LATAM Airlines Soared 33% in September | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of LATAM Airlines Soared 33% in September. South America's largest airline has an important new partner.. What happened.,"   Shares of LATAM Airlines Group (NYSE: LTM) gained 33% in September, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after the South American aviation company announced a joint venture and alliance with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Delta stole LATAM out of the arms of U.S. rival American Airlines Group after Chilean officials expressed concerns about LATAM and American cooperating on routes. LATAM, South America's largest airline group, is a longtime partner of American but in May was blocked from forming a joint venture with the U.S. carrier. That looked like a setback for LATAM in its efforts to lock in a U.S. partner and split revenue on premium routes connecting U.S. business travelers to the Southern Hemisphere. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Delta stepped into that void in September, announcing plans to buy a 20% stake in LATAM for $1.9 billion ahead of forming a joint venture with the carrier. Delta has far less exposure to South America than American and is seen likely to win antitrust immunity with LATAM to allow the two companies to coordinate schedules and pricing. LATAM also won commitments from Delta to buy four Airbus A350s from LATAM and take over 10 other A350 orders, allowing the South American carrier to better rationalize its fleet and reduce future spending. Delta agreed to buy the shares for $16 apiece, nearly double the sub-$9-per-share price LATAM traded at prior to the announcement. LATAM shares had been down more than 20% year to date coming into September, but following the agreement the shares are now up for the year. Even after the jump, LATAM trades at a discount to the price Delta paid for the shares. That could be an indication of the lengths Delta was willing to go to secure a deal, or it could be interpreted as Delta being more confident than current shareholders that there is long-term value in LATAM. The deal appears more favorable for Delta than LATAM, giving the U.S. airline strong exposure to one of the few regions where it was lacking while creating at least some risk to LATAM, as it now must break its links with American and forge ties with a new partner. But the joint venture should benefit both parties and help LATAM to present itself as South America's premium airline operator catering to business travelers. It's tough to say where LATAM shares will go","Oct 3, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/03/why-shares-of-latam-airlines-soared-33-in-septembe.aspx

What About Dividends?. A Different Perspective. Discounted cash","Buying shares in the best businesses can build meaningful wealth for you and your family. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. Just think about the savvy investors who held Qantas Airways Limited (ASX:QAN) shares for the last five years, while they gained 324%. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. On top of that, the share price is up 10% in about a quarter. Check out our latest analysis for Qantas Airways To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement. During the five years of share price growth, Qantas Airways moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the Qantas Airways share price has gained 99% in three years. During the same period, EPS grew by 3.4% each year. Notably, the EPS growth has been slower than the annualised share price gain of 26% over three years. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Qantas Airways's earnings, revenue and cash flow. It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock.

Disclaimer: The TipRanks Smart Score performance is based on backtested results. Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account.

Messamore | Email | Leave a comment Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) plunged dramatically in after hours trading Wednesday. Starting the day off at $243 per share at the opening bell, the automaker’s stock dropped to $229/share by 5 p.m. Eastern. Tesla’s Quarter 3 delivery numbers caused the 5.7% plunge. But here’s the kicker: Q3 2019 was Tesla’s best quarter ever. So what are investors thinking? They’re thinking 100,000. On September 26th, a leaked Elon Musk email set expectations for 100,000 Tesla deliveries in Quarter 3. That email to Tesla employees said: “We have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarter, which is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company!” Big scoop for $TSLA $TSLAQ and massive milestone for Tesla and the EV market. If Elon says it 5 days before EOQ, it’s probably really achievable https://t.co/Q6vm8Fn0Tx — Fred Lambert (@FredericLambert) September 26, 2019  That email warmed markets up, and Tesla stock jumped more than 5% that day. The 100,000 figure represents a major psychological milestone. With 95,000 Teslas delivered in the record-setting second quarter of this year, it did look within reach. But when the numbers came out Wednesday, Tesla’s 97,000 new car deliveries seemed disappointing. That’s despite the fact that this was Tesla’s best quarter ever. It really demonstrates the power of calibrating (or mis-calibrating) expectations. Posting record quarterly sales would give most stocks a bump but Elon Musk set investors up to be disappointed with these figures. After Musk set the benchmark at 100,000,","Oct 3, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/elon-musks-big-mouth-crashes-tesla-stock/
