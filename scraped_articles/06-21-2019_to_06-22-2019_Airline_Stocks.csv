At 12.46 p.m., the Jet Airways stock was trading at Rs 41.75 a share, or at 26.13 per cent higher than its previous close on Wednesday. “A bounce back was due but since the on ground condition of the airline is dull, the surge in the stock price is unlikely to stay for long,” said Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities. The state-run State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium of lenders to Jet Airways said on Monday that it had decided to “seek resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as only a conditional bid was received and requirement of the investor for SEBI exemptions and resolution of all creditors is possible under IBC”. The company also announced the resignation of two independent directors — Ashok Chawla and Sharad Sharma — on Tuesday, giving another signal that the chances of the airline’s revival were remote. Besides owing Rs 8,500 crore to public sector banks, the airline has a total liability of about Rs 25,000 crore, which includes dues of operational creditors. Running out of cash, Jet Airways suspended its entire operations on April 17. The government, subsequently, re-allocated the carrier’s slots and foreign traffic rights to rival carriers.

3,SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar says decision to take Jet Airways to NCLT was last effort to find resolution,SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar says decision to take Jet Airways to NCLT was last effort to find resolution. The SBI," On a day the National Company Law Tribunal admitted the insolvency plea of the state-owned State Bank of India, its Chairman Rajnish Kumar said the decision to send Jet Airways to the tribunal was taken as a ""last effort to find a resolution"" for the debt-ridden private airline. During the SBI's 64th AGM meeting on Thursday, Kumar said: ""Taking Jet Airways to the NCLT is the last effort to find a resolution. There are cogent reasons for what the lenders are doing. Every decision has been taken after a lot of due deliberations."" Not ruling out from the possibility of liquidation, Kumar said that Jet Airways was the first airline to be sent to the NCLT. ""We will have to see how does it proceed and what legal principle gets laid out,"" he added. The bankruptcy tribunal said the Jet Airways case was of ""national importance"" and ordered a resolution as per the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act within 90 days. Jet Airways employees take note! SpiceJet, IndiGo are looking for pilots, managers, cabin crew; check details The SBI had filed an insolvency petition against Jet Airways before the Mumbai bench of NCLT on Tuesday earlier this week. The bank had also recommended Ashish Chhawchharia of Grant Thornton as Interim Resolution Professional (IRP). Now the NCLT has asked the IRP to take control of the carrier's assets. The tribunal also asked the IRP to submit a status report on the resolution process every fortnight. The first status report is to be submitted on July 5, 2019. Jet Airways had stopped operations on April 17 after lenders refused funds required to keep the airline afloat. The banks have been trying to salvage the company ever since. The SBI-led consortium of banks that had extended loans to Jet Airways agreed to file insolvency proceedings against the airline after the bank-led resolution process failed to get any results. The consortium had been in control of the company's board since March after the exit of its founder Naresh Goyal. End of the road for Jet Airways!

4,Banks finally accept India's oldest private-sector airline Jet Airways is dead - The Financial Express,Banks finally accept India’s oldest private-sector airline Jet Airways is dead. The airline could still have survived even if that,"Two months after India’s oldest private-sector airline grounded its last plane, and with even a water-bottling firm threatening to drag the carrier into bankruptcy, a consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India can finally stop pretending that a white knight is coming. With the insolvency tribunal taking Jet Airways India Ltd. under its wing on Thursday, there may be one more abortive attempt to sell it whole. But now that lessors have taken most of the fleet, employees have all but given up on back wages, and the country’s aviation market has moved on, liquidation is the most practical solution. Little will be recovered from financial and operational creditors’ claims, which may add up to more than 140 billion rupees ($2 billion), according to local media reports. Jet, as Monty Python might have observed, isn’t exactly a Norwegian blue, pining for the fjords. It’s a dead parrot. Banks killed it with kindness. If only they had seen that founder Naresh Goyal wasn’t able to cover costs, and was using borrowed money to keep the full-service airline afloat amid intense competition with low-cost rivals. One refusal from them to lend more without fresh equity from 51% owner Goyal, his 24% partner Etihad Airways PJSC, or the public, would have hastened the default that finally occurred in January. Even then, creditors could have produced a new controlling shareholder in an out-of-court process if they’d wrested control of the board from Goyal rather than waiting until late March. The airline could still have survived even if that had failed, with banks supplying working capital through an in-court bankruptcy process.  A new owner wouldn’t have made creditors whole, but any offer would have been better than the chump change they will get from liquidation of a grounded carrier. So why didn’t SBI and other creditors act earlier? They probably never believed Goyal, a survivor of several tight corners in the last 25 years, was going to crash land this time. After they did wake up to that possibility, they still dithered. Banks are already swamped by $200 billion-plus of soured corporate debt. Every exposure taken to the bankruptcy tribunal means more money to be set aside from profit, which has been in short supply at Indian lenders lately. Also, the 2016 law has already been so badly abused by owners trying to stall the sale of prized assets that banks are","Jun 22, 2019",https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banks-finally-accept-indias-oldest-private-sector-airline-jet-airways-is-dead/1615304/

6,Ethical investment – Returns on good behaviour? | Reuters Events | Sustainable Business,. Ethical investment – Returns on good behaviour?. Related Reads. Latest News. Editor's Picks. Latest Tweets. Upcoming Events. Most Popular,"  The launch of the Global Compact 100 Index, which selects its line-up according to financial performance as well as sustainability credentials, pits purists against pragmatists There is a new kid on the block in environment, social and governance investment, and it’s one that has some answers for those who remain sceptical about “social investing”. The Global Compact 100 index offers welcome new developments in a field hungry for innovation and dogged by ideological correctness. The GC 100 tracks the stock market performance of a representative group of Global Compact companies selected not only on their adherence to the Global Compact’s 10 principles covering human rights, labour, environmental and anti-corruption standards, but also on evidence of leadership commitment and consistent profitability. “While many other sustainability screens focus primarily on the environment and social dimensions, we’re a little different,” says Gavin Power, deputy director of the United Nations Global Compact, which launched the index in September. The measure of pre-tax profitability included in the new index is a factor often overlooked by competing sustainability screens. “We’ve established a baseline for every eligible company,” Power says. The GC 100 companies were selected from about 1,000 publicly traded corporations, a fraction of the more than 8,000 GC member companies. The index is more nuanced than most of the competition, even its chief rival, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a key reference benchmark for investment companies since its launch in 1999. The DJSI and its various offshoots rely on annual assessments developed by RobecoSAM. They are solid products and the questionnaire they are based on is well regarded, but the indexes depend heavily on self-reporting and have no financial screens. The GC 100 also avoids the chief pitfall of classic social investing – a reliance on squishy “social values”, focusing instead on metrics and transparency. Green roots The modern roots of corporate social investing can be traced to the 1970s and 1980s, marked by the confluence of the environmental movement, anti-apartheid activism and the excitement generated by entrepreneurial “socially responsible” businesses including Green & Black’s and Ben & Jerry’s. The original wave of social funds tended to divide the corporate world into “good” and “bad” companies. But by whose definitions and with what values? Catholics got to choose the Aquinas Fund and Muslims the Islamia Fund, both of which clumsily applied religious doctrines to corporate behaviour. Concerned about the environment?

Partnership,"      Vishesh Raisinghani | June 21, 2019 | More on: FLT Having the first-mover advantage in a nascent industry that is yet to hit the tipping point for growth is usually the driving force behind hyper-fast wealth creation. Buying into the early leaders in technology sectors with massive potential is risky but could sometimes be highly lucrative. One such industry poised for incredible growth is the drone delivery sector. Advanced battery technology, device miniaturization, and unmanned autonomous flying software have finally come together to make drones commercially viable. However, the tech isn’t restricted to hobbyists and collectors. Instead, it’s solving a critical problem for the logistics industry. Last-mile deliveries are often the most complex to manage and time consuming. While the global supply chain to deliver items from the factory floor to the local distribution centre has been perfected over decades, getting stuff from the local warehouse to your doorstep is still a challenge. Now, with small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), companies can circumvent the traffic jams and complex road networks to deliver tiny parcels directly to your backyard. It’s a market that is quickly expanding and already has major players such as Google and Amazon interested. Goldman Sachs believes the industry could generate $100 billion annually by 2020. Canada’s leader in this market is already listed on the public stock exchange. Vaughan-based Drone Delivery Canada (TSXV:FLT) has spent the past five years perfecting its drones and management software. The services are now ready for prime time, and the company has already struck some interesting deals to generate revenue going forward. Two of these deals stand out as early indicators of DDC’s potential. In May this year, the company struck a deal with Canada’s largest commercial airline to operate several routes for package deliveries across the country. According to the terms of the agreement, DDC will build and operate up to 150,000 drone delivery routes in Canada. These routes will include timetables, flight schedules, payload capacities, type of drones to be deployed, and payment terms. Air Canada Cargo, the airline’s logistics arm, will market DDC’s services as a premium offering to its customers. The agreement includes an exclusivity clause to ensure Air Canada cannot engage with any of DDC’s competitors in the sector.

Earn $1,000 Monthly Passive Income With a $100,000 Investment in These 2","      Jason Phillips | June 22, 2019 | More on: CHE.UN IPL IPL.UN Most stocks trading on the TSX Index that pay dividends typically make those dividend payments about once a quarter or once every three months. However, there are some other listings that will pay their dividends more frequently than that. Most of those listings are structured as real estate investment trusts (REITS), but there are still a few exceptions out there. Here are two stocks that pay monthly dividends and that aren’t REITs. With a $100,000 initial investment, they could net you a cool $1,000 in monthly passive income from your Registered Retirement Savings Account (RRSP). Chemtrade Logistics Income Fund (TSX:CHE.UN) operates a diversified chemicals business, providing industrial products and services to customers throughout North American markets. Through its Sulphur Products & Performance Chemicals division, Chemtrade is a leading processor of spent acid from the petroleum refining industry as well as the largest producer of ultra pure sulphuric acid used by the electronics industry. Meanwhile, through its Water Solutions and Specialty Chemicals division, CHE manufactures and sells water treatment solutions to municipal and industrial clientele, while its Electrochemicals segment also helps manufacture agents used in by pulp and paper mills. CHE stock currently pays its shareholders $0.10 each month, which works to a 13.1% annual dividend yield — one of the highest payouts you’ll find anywhere on the TSX Index these days. Unlike Chemtrade, which is faced with the unfortunate challenge of having to continually manage its exposure to changing chemicals prices, a company like Inter Pipeline (TSX:IPL) has the advantage that as much as 70% of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) come from cost-of-service and fee-based contracts. That element goes a long way in providing the company with added flexibility, whereby it can use any surplus cash flows from favourable swings in commodity prices to invest in profitable growth projects like its Heartland Complex, Canada’s first integrated propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene complex. The Heartland Complex, which is expected come into service sometime in late 2021, comes with a price tag in the neighbourhood of $3.5 billion but is expected to add up to $500 million in annual EBITDA by the time all is said and done.

Burnsville Office","Today, U.S. Rep. Angie Craig introduced the Halt Unchecked Member Benefits with Lobbying Elimination or HUMBLE Act, which would permanently ban Members of Congress from serving as lobbyists and require them to sell individual stocks upon being sworn in. The HUMBLE Act also restricts unnecessary perks for Members, including a ban on taxpayer funded first-class airline accommodations.

For too long, Members of Congress have used their positions of power to advocate for special interests and gain personal profits. This bill would ensure that Members of Congress come to Washington to serve and leave just the same.

The HUMBLE Act: “Minnesotans need Congress to be focused on addressing the issues they face in their own lives - including lowering the price of prescription drugs and health care, rethinking career skills and technical education and investing in our roads and bridges. But unfortunately, conflicts of interest and the influence of special interests have gotten in the way of this critical work,” said Rep. Craig. “A lifetime ban on lobbying will ensure that Congress is no longer a revolving door of influence, and banning individual stock ownership will cut down on conflicts of interest and show that Congress has its priorities straight so that we can advocate for policies that will improve lives and expand economic opportunity for every Minnesotan.”

In addition to introducing the HUMBLE Act, Rep. Craig also stood up to House Democratic leadership recently and introduced an amendment to stop an increase in pay for Members of Congress. Rep. Craig has also championed H.R.1, the For the People Act, a comprehensive government reform bill to increase transparency in campaign finance and make it easier to vote. The House adopted Craig’s provision to ban Members of Congress from serving on for-profit corporate boards, and she continues to fight to make government accountable to Minnesotans, not special interests.
