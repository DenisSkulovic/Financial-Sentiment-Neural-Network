2,Why Airline Shares Are Soaring Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Soaring Today. Sentiment is improving concerning the long-term outlook for the sector.. What happened. So what.,"   Many airline stocks have lost more than half of their value this year, as the COVID-19 pandemic has caused global air travel demand to evaporate and left carriers scrambling to cut costs to survive. The stocks have been trading as if bankruptcies were inevitable. While the pandemic is far from contained, airline investors in recent days are beginning to gain confidence that the worst-case scenarios that have driven stocks to multiyear lows can be avoided. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) all climbed more than 10% on Wednesday morning thanks to that growing sense of optimism. We are in the middle of airline earning season, but there is no real news to tie to any of the carriers that are surging. Instead the move appears tied to an overall improvement in market sentiment, tied to some states taking initial steps to lift COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and begin the process of reopening. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The airlines are going to feel the impact of the pandemic for some time to come, with carriers bringing down capacity by upwards of 90% in the second quarter. But that's already priced into the stocks, and thanks to a $50 billion U.S. government bailout, the airlines have ample liquidity to ride out the near-term storm. Of course, that bailout money will last only so long, and since the government came through with the funds, the focus has been on how long travel demand will remain at depressed levels. The industry came into this downturn relatively healthy, and the airlines should be able to survive at more typical recessionary demand levels, so the United States pushing to normalize would be an important step in the airline industry's recovery.  AIRLINES YEAR TO DATE DATA BY YCHARTS Investors will learn more in the days to come, as American and United will report first-quarter results and discuss their outlooks for the second half of 2020. Based on the results from Delta and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), the first-quarter losses might be less than anticipated. It's hard to get too excited about this rally, because the stocks are still down significantly for the year. But it is worth noting that stocks like United and Spirit were down more than 75% for the year just last month, so it","Apr 29, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/29/why-airline-shares-are-higher-today.aspx
3,Why Airline Shares Are Up Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Up Today. There are encouraging signs that the industry can tap capital markets.. What happened. So,"   Shares of U.S. airlines are gaining altitude on Tuesday, powered by a number of new datapoints that indicate the industry still has access to capital markets, and is holding up as well as can be expected despite a dramatic drop-off in travel demand. Airlines are far from out of danger, but all indications are that they're weathering the storm. Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) were both up 10% apiece as of 12:30 p.m. EDT. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), American Air Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were all up more than 5%. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The airlines headed into first-quarter earnings season with investors focused more on what is going on now than concerned with what happened months ago. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global travel demand to fall by more than 90%, leading airlines to scramble to cut costs and raising questions about their long-term viability. Investors have responded by running for the emergency exits, sending shares of these airlines down between 53% and 69% year to date. Revenue has all but dried up, with United, for example, expecting to fly fewer people during the entire month of May 2020 than it did on a single day in May 2019. The question for airlines at this point is whether they have enough cash to hold on until traffic eventually returns.  AIRLINES DATA BY YCHARTS. Investors have received some good news in recent days about airline liquidity, and the industry's ability to raise fresh capital. Delta is reportedly increasing the size of a planned debt offering by $2 billion to $5 billion because it sees robust demand for the notes, and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) intends to tap debt and equity markets for $2.6 billion in fresh capital. Southwest also reported earnings on Tuesday, and in its presentation said it expects to bleed through $30 million to $35 million in cash each day during the current quarter. The company had $5.5 billion in cash as of March 31, which leaves time for traffic to recover. Although Southwest is arguably healthier than most of the other airlines, the entire industry is experiencing this slowdown together, so the company's experiences are relevant to what is going on at other carriers. Some of the airlines most vulnerable to a downturn are the stocks getting the biggest boosts on","Apr 28, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/28/why-airline-shares-are-up-today.aspx
4,Market Crash Alert: Warren Buffett Is Selling His Airline Stocks - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Market Crash Alert: Warren Buffett Is Selling His Airline Stocks. Unusual fear,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | April 28, 2020 | More on: CJT Warren Buffett seems to be “distancing” himself from the core principles of value investing. Normally, the legendary value investor would capitalize on a market crash. But the followers of the high-profile proponent of the strategy are getting a different signal in the 2020 market crash. Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett’s conglomerate, amassed billions of dollars in recent market downturns. His motto is to be greedy when others are fearful during turbulent times. Buffett, however, appears to be the fearful one these days. He has been selling plenty of airline stocks instead of buying depressed stocks. Many investors have learned and profited from Buffett’s value investing approach. People are again expecting him to go on a buying spree so they can follow his lead. But with the coronavirus turning the global economy upside down, the value of Berkshire’s stock portfolio is falling. The airline industry is taking massive hits, prompting Buffett to sell 13 million shares of Delta Airlines and 2.3 million shares of Southwest Airlines. Buffett’s about-face in dumping the supposed value stocks bought in 2016 is sending shock waves in the investing world. Buffett derives higher returns from his value stocks because he maintains a margin of safety. It’s the difference between the real or fundamental value and the price you pay for the stock. By buying less than the real value, Buffett has a greater margin or leeway before losing money. As COVID-19 plays its course and travel restrictions are in place, airline stocks are the most fragile. Buffett lost his safety buffer and somehow underestimated the impact of the pandemic. The outlook for the travel industry is gloomy. Buffett worries about the margins of airline companies in 10 or 15 years from now. Cargojet (TSX:CJT) is an exception, however, and its shares are even outperforming the general market. The stock is up 18.4% year-to-date versus the TSX’s 15.7% loss. This $1.9 billion company is ferrying essential cargo and not carrying passengers. In response to the increasing demand and the need to fill supply chains, Cargojet redeployed aircraft flying international scheduled and charter routes. This prominent air cargo provider is prioritizing the transport of e-commerce, healthcare, and other essential supplies across Canada and North America. Despite the adjustments in flight schedules, Cargojet gave assurances that it’s well equipped to handle the situation and","Apr 28, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/28/market-crash-alert-warren-buffett-is-selling-his-airline-stocks/

CMC Crypto," With the coronavirus pandemic deflating air-travel demand to an unprecedented level, the not-so-long-ago high-flying airlines have been brought to their knees across the globe.  This is because passenger revenues, the largest component of their top line, took a massive hit from shrunken air-travel demand. With passenger demand for air travel almost evaporating in the face of the ongoing COVID-19 emergency, it is of no surprise that the first-quarter results of airline stocks have thus far been discouraging. Notably, Delta Air Lines DAL, which kicked off this earnings season for the airlines industry on Apr 22, incurred its first quarterly loss since 2010, mainly due to the steep 18.2% drop in passenger revenues. Similarly, Southwest Airlines LUV suffered its first quarterly loss in almost a decade with passenger revenues drooping 19% in the first quarter. Against this backdrop, investors will keenly await earnings releases of United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL, which are slated for release on Apr 30. Our quantitative model indicates that a company needs the right combination of the following two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of a positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. United Airlines: Even though passenger traffic is expected to have been strong in January and February, the fact that air-travel demand took a beating in March as the coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization aboutthat time, is likely to have stressed United Airlines’ top line in the to-be-reported quarter. However, low fuel prices are expected to have bumped up the bottom line in the March quarter. In fact, the proven Zacks model predicts an earnings beat for United Airlines this time around. This is because the carrier has an Earnings ESP of +3.23% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

8,AAL Stock Is Still a Long-Term Winner | InvestorPlace,American Airlines Stock Is Still a Long-Term Winner. Reduced fear of Covid-19 should also help American and its peers. States’," Several upbeat comments by Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which reported its first-quarter results yesterday, bode well for the longer-term outlook of American Airlines (NYSE:AAL) stock. Southwest’s comments are also positive for all airlines in the U.S.  During Southwest’s Q1 earnings conference call, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said “it feels like” the company’s revenue trends “bottomed out the first week of April.” He added that “we’ve seen very gradual improvement in weeks two and three [of April].” Kelly said he was hopeful that revenue trends would continue to rebound in May. The CEO appeared to hold out hope that June will rebound meaningfully from a revenue standpoint, saying “we’ve got pretty modest expectations … for June at this point. And hopefully we’re too pessimistic there.” The CEO added that, “hopefully by July, August, we’re beginning to see some improvement that would encourage us” and help Southwest’s management determine how to proceed going forward. So Kelly did not rule out the possibility of a significant recovery in the summer. That’s certainly good news for American Airlines and AAL stock. When American Airlines reports its Q1 results tomorrow, it will obviously be very important to see whether American’s CEO, Doug Parker, also indicates that the airline’s revenue appears to have bottomed. Of course, such a statement would be very positive for American Airlines and the company’s stock. In his statements yesterday, Kelly, Southwest’s CEO, indicated that airlines will benefit from the lifting of closures enacted in response to Covid-19. In several recent columns about airline stocks, I’ve expressed the idea that demand for airplane tickets will increase when states reopen, giving travelers fun and interesting things to do when they arrive at their destinations. Kelly expressed that notion as well, saying “for those who are willing and able to travel, the country needs to open back up. So there’s something for people to do when they get there.” So it’s certainly positive for American Airlines and its peers that, in recent days, multiple states have started opening their economies.

10,DAL Stock Isn't in the Kind of Danger You Worried It Might Be | InvestorPlace,"DAL Stock Isn’t in the Kind of Danger You Worried It Might Be. Profits won't come quickly for DAL stock,"," Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) was one of the first of the legacy airlines to report first-quarter earnings, and the results for DAL stock were pretty much what we expected.  But as Delta is now trading at a 60% discount from where it was before the novel coronavirus, and retrenching for a long, slow recovery, I’m convinced there’s a great opportunity here for investors with a long-term time horizon. All you have to do is be patient, and DAL will reward you in the coming quarters. Just a month ago, I was very uncertain about Delta. I’ve always liked legacy airliners and the profits that they bring to investors, but I was worried that DAL and other airlines taking CARES Act assistance would be prevented from offering dividends in the short term. I even went as far as to call Delta a gamble without its dividend. So I’ve taken a closer look at this Atlanta-based airliner. I reviewed the first-quarter earnings reports, and I’ve poured over the transcript from Delta’s post-earnings call with analysts. And now I’m convinced that DAL is on the right track, and that my own investment in Delta will pay handsomely. First, the earnings report. Delta reported at $534 million loss for the first quarter – its first quarterly loss in five years. The loss excluding special items was $326 million, versus a profit of $639 million in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue fell 18% to $1.9 billion, and the miles flown by paying passengers dropped by 17%. Keep in mind, however, that the coronavirus largely only affected international flights for the first two months of the quarter. It wasn’t until March when domestic flights really took a hit, as social distancing and stay-at-home orders became the norm for much of the U.S. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE Happily, Delta is now in a position to restart some of its more lucrative and important international flights. But even when that revenue, the second quarter for DAL stock will likely be much worse than the first. Delta reiterated its previous warnings that Q2 revenue will be down roughly 90%. Delta is taking positive steps to cut expenses for the quarter, including parking more than 650 aircraft, consolidating concourses, chopping advertising campaigns and closing Sky Clubs. Those steps alone will save about $550 million for the quarter, says Delta CFO","Apr 29, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/04/dal-stock-isnt-in-danger/

14,"Coronavirus: With few passengers, Sun Country speeds plan to fly for Amazon","Facing a lack of passengers, Sun Country Airlines ramps up plan to fly packages for Amazon. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","As millions of would-be travelers stay home because of the coronavirus pandemic, one airline has found an eager customer: Amazon. Sun Country Airlines, owned by an Apollo Global Management fund, struck a deal last December to start flying 10 Boeing 737 freighters for the online retailer. Minneapolis-based Sun Country plans to be flying all 10 of the cargo planes by the end of July, earlier than the previous target for summer’s end, CEO Jude Bricker told CNBC on Wednesday. Passenger demand is down 95% at Sun Country from what was expected just a few months ago, echoing similar declines throughout the U.S. air travel industry, so the additional cargo business is welcome. The operation will begin with its first plane on May 7.  While Sun Country’s plans to fly dedicated planes for Amazon started last year, other airlines are now turning to air cargo as they face a dearth of passengers. American, Delta and United are among the large airlines that have flown pure-cargo flights, delivering everything from perishables to medical supplies. Sun Country, whose low-cost passenger operation focuses on sun-seekers and other travelers visiting friends and relatives around the U.S., had already planned to shuffle pilots to cater to the new Amazon cargo flying this summer. “We got a little bit lucky,” Bricker said. “We were the main constraint in the ramping [up]. We were taking pilots off the passenger service and now that’s not a concern.” Bricker said it was too early to tell whether the company will expand its partnership with Amazon. The online retailer didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The airline had been preparing for a potential initial public offering in the first half of 2020, but “clearly, given what’s happened, that’s on hold,” said Dave Davis, Sun Country’s president and CFO, adding that going public at all this year is unlikely. An IPO isn’t off the table entirely but it will depend on the overall economy and the market for airline stocks, Davis added. Sun Country was approved for $60 million of $25 billion in federal grants earmarked for U.S. airlines to continue paying staff until Sept. 30. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

15,Southwest Airlines (LUV) earnings Q1 2020 results in loss and revenue plunge,"Southwest Airlines posts first loss since 2011, sees revenue down as much as 95% in May. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Southwest Airlines on Tuesday posted its first quarterly loss since 2011 and predicted “no material improvement in air travel trends” this spring as the coronavirus devastates demand. Southwest is scrambling to cut costs and reduce its daily cash burn, which it estimates will average $30 million to $35 million in the second quarter. It announced a public stock offering of 55 million shares, valued at around $1.6 billion based on Monday’s closing price and said it would issue $1 billion in additional debt in an effort to shore up its finances amid a dismal demand outlook. The airline said it expects its operating revenue next month to fall as much as 95% from a year earlier but warned it is “unable to reasonably estimate trends beyond May 2020.” Southwest follows Delta and United in posting a loss for the quarter. Travel is among the hardest-hit industries from the coronavirus and severe measures to stop it from spreading like shelter-in-place orders. Airlines including Southwest recently won a portion of $25 billion in government grants and loans that prohibit them from laying off or cutting the pay rates of workers through Sept. 30, though worker paychecks are lower because of reduced schedules. CEO Gary Kelly told CNBC that if demand doesn’t come back by that time the airline will have no choice but to downsize. However, demand likely bottomed out in the first week of April and there have been modest improvements during the month, he said later on the company’s earnings call. “I would hope that, that would continue,” he said. “We’ve got a pretty modest expectations.” First-quarter results reflect the start of coronavirus and of stay-at-home orders in the United States, where most of Southwest’s network is located. Travel demand was still relatively strong early in the year, but losses are expected to deepen in the spring. The timing of the coronavirus crisis couldn’t be worse for the sector. The disease and accompanying economic downturn is sapping travel demand during the peak spring and summer travel season, usually airlines’ most lucrative time of year. Kelly said travelers will return to the skies when they feel safe, a sentiment shared by other airline CEOs. Airlines are starting to offer travelers face masks to avoid the spread of the coronavirus, while JetBlue on Wednesday said it would mandate them for passengers.

Luminar (LAZR) IPO: Investors make wrong stock surge more than,"NATIONAL READ NEXT → NATIONAL NATIONAL NASDAQ United Airlines(NYSE:UAL) is one of the nation’s foremost airlines with a 14.9% market share in 2019. The stock has been a market darling and ended the last decade posting an impressive 5.8x increase in market cap. Coming into 2020, the market expected robust growth, but little did anyone know about what lay ahead. The coronavirus pandemic devastated the entire aviation, travel and entertainment sector. Since the spread of the pandemic numerous airline executives have gone on the record to say that the current state of the economy is even worse than it was post 9/11 with demand falling to unprecedented lows. Things got even worse for legacy airlines like American, Delta and United compared to low cost ones due to higher leverage and operating costs. The United airlines stock is down 66% YTD, and that’s after the stock rallied an impressive 24% in two session due to gradual lifting of lockdown and travel bans. The reality actually is that even when restrictions are lifted, people will be skeptical to close proximity and demand will be low due to to the current economic scenario and will take years at the earliest to recover to pre-pandemic levels. The airline is currently operating at 20% capacity and is also harmed by the fact that it is one if the largest US operators of the Boeing 737 MAX, which has currently been grounded by the FAA(Forbes). The company is also at a unique disadvantage due being centered at San Francisco, where all mass gathering tech events have been cancelled, and Houston, where the state economy has nose-dived due to the international oil crash.((Motley Fool) The airline industry being a capital intensive business means that United has been burning between $25 million to $50 million of dollars a day. Earlier in the month, the company made a new equity offering of approximately $1.2 billion at $26.5 a share to maintain liquidity, this was particularly harmful as the offering was made a 5 year low and hurt existing shareholders due to a 15% equity dilution(Seeking Alpha).
