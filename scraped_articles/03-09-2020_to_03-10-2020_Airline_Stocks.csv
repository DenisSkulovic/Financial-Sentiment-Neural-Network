5,Why Airline Shares Are Climbing Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Climbing Today. A number of carriers announce strong moves designed to counter a coronavirus-induced travel slump..,"   Shares of major airlines all climbed more than 5% on Tuesday morning after the companies announced sweeping moves designed to cushion the blow of a COVID-19 coronavirus-related travel slump. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) led the sector higher, with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) also climbing. Airline stocks have been among the hardest hit during the coronavirus sell-off, with shares of American losing nearly half of their value at their lows. The industry has reported that demand for travel into areas most affected by the outbreak has evaporated, and overall demand is falling rapidly. United announced plans to cut capacity last week, and Delta and American followed on Tuesday morning by announcing their own cuts to international and domestic flights. The cuts are centered on trans-Pacific routes, but domestic flights will be reduced by 10% or more. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Delta, American, United, and Southwest combine to account for about 80% of the domestic market, so the impact on U.S. air travel will be significant. But the cuts should help prevent fare wars as airlines scramble to fill empty seats at any price. Delta is also instituting a companywide hiring freeze and will park some aircraft, as well as defer about $500 million in planned capital expenditures and delay a $500 million planned voluntary pension funding. American is accelerating cost-cutting. On Tuesday, United followed up last week's cuts by suspending its share-buyback program, and its CEO and president will both forgo their base salaries during the crisis. All of the major airlines have suspended their first-quarter guidance due to the outbreak, though United admitted on Tuesday it expects to incur a loss in the current quarter. United also successfully raised $2 billion in added liquidity on Monday. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly is also taking a pay cut during the crisis. The market, mindful that past downturns have led to companies including Eastern Airlines, TWA, and Pan Am to disappear from the skies, has been worried about potential bankruptcies due to a prolonged travel slump. The industry has changed, and there was reason to believe all major airlines can weather this storm even before these latest moves, but seeing industry participants take bold actions seems to have reassured investors. One morning with higher share prices is no reason to take a victory lap.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   In the past week, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) increased its revenue decline projection for the airline industry in 2020. The forecast for the higher amount of revenue losses was due to multiple flight cancellations following the rapid spread of the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19) to multiple countries across the globe. Additionally, passenger traffic growth across the globe in January 2020 was the slowest in a decade due to the above-mentioned health peril. Moreover, with Italy being one of the worst-affected coronavirus countries, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY, which had earlier decided to trim its capacity to/from Italy by 25% from Mar 17 to Apr 8, announced that it intends to suspend more domestic and international Italian flights through Apr 8. Coronavirus-related updates were also available from U.S. carriers like JetBlue Airways JBLU and Southwest Airlines LUV in the past week. While JetBlue withdrew its first-quarter 2020 and full-year outlooks, Southwest Airlines lowered its first-quarter unit revenue view due to this health hazard. (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here) Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. According to Alexandre de Juniac, director general and CEO of the IATA, passenger traffic growth across the globe in January 2020 was the slowest in a decade. Notably, demand (measured in total revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) inched up 2.4% in the month on a year-over-year basis, signaling the lowest monthly increase since Apr 2010.Juniac termed the January traffic performance of airlines as the “tip of the iceberg’ as “major travel restrictions in China did not begin until Jan 23”. In the opening month of the ongoing year, the health scare was only confined to China and was still considered an epidemic. (Read more: Coronavirus Upends Air Travel as Growth Slumps to Decade Low). 2. Given the vast majority of countries that the coronavirus outbreak has spread to and the resultant slump in forward bookings, the IATA now anticipates a global passenger revenue loss of $63-$113 billion for 2020. This is significantly higher than the previous projection of a $29.3-billion passenger revenue loss when its estimate was based on the","Mar 10, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-stock-roundup-iatas-downbeat-154003358.html
8,Coronavirus leads to cheap airfare but not enough to shield airlines,Bargain airfares not enough to entice travelers ‘fearful at any price’ amid coronavirus. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"Fears over the spread of the coronavirus are leading to emptier planes, sending airline shares down to fresh multiyear lows and handing carriers their biggest challenge in a generation. Some airlines are pausing hiring, offering unpaid leave and cutting flights to reduce costs as the virus spreads. U.S. airlines, which analysts consider among the best in the world to weather a crisis, have dropped more sharply than the broader market. One side effect of the decline in air travel demand: bargain fares. A round-trip ticket between the New York area and Miami around the Passover and Easter holidays, when New York City public school students are on vacation, ranges between $142 and $177, for the cheapest, basic-economy fares on airlines including Delta, American and United, a Kayak search on Monday showed. On discount carrier Frontier, a ticket search showed seats for that route around $137. The popular leisure route isn’t the only deal. Boston to San Francisco, a popular business-class route, showed fares below $1,100. “We would expect to see prices much higher,” said Gary Leff, a travel expert who writes the View from the Wing blog. “The lowest fares aren’t being snatched up, and that’s scary.” Some airline executives have said that they are not necessarily lowering fares, but that there aren’t many takers for the lowest ones. Many would-be travelers are “fearful at any price,” Leff said. Airline bookings in North America were down about 8% in the last week of February and by “mid-teen” percentage points in the first week of March, according to a Credit Suisse note published Monday. “As the number of infections rises, major events are postponed or canceled, and companies implement further travel restrictions, bookings and cancellations will decline further,” Credit Suisse airline analyst Joe Caiado wrote. “And this is not a demand shortfall that can be stimulated with lower fares (or Fed rate cuts), given that it pertains to consumer psychology around health & safety.”  The second quarter could be “disastrous” he said, adding that the severity is not yet clear.  Still, some travelers are jumping on the deals. Roshanda Johnson, a 32-year-old marketing specialist, said last week that she paid $175 for a round-trip ticket between San Francisco and New Orleans to attend a sorority sister’s wedding there later this month.  “It was $400-$500” earlier in the week before booking, she said. “I’m not worried about the virus","Mar 9, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-leads-to-cheap-airfare-but-not-enough-to-shield-airlines.html

11,"American, Delta cut routes and Southwest, United reduce CEO pay on coronavirus fears - The Washington Post","Airlines slash routes, outlook and executive pay on coronavirus fallout. Delta and American scale back U.S. and international flights, while","The coronavirus outbreak continued its economic pillage Tuesday, prompting several major airlines to slash routes, reset their financial outlooks and even slash executive pay. The crisis has thrown much of the tourism industry into free fall. In a matter of weeks, hotels, airlines and convention centers have seen their bookings plummet as leisure travelers stay home and businesses discourage or cancel employee travel. But the latest updates from Delta, American, United and Southwest airlines signaled just how bleak their outlook is for the months to come. And as travelers cancel vacations, businesses discourage employees from leaving town, and conventions are canceled en mass, industry executives are comparing the outbreak’s fear factor to the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “We are in unprecedented territory,” Cowen’s Helane Becker wrote Tuesday in an analyst note. “Airlines have been quick to cut capacity and either park or accelerate retirement of older aircraft. … In the past, they would have waited to make these adjustments."" Delta said it is cutting international flights by as much as 25 percent and domestic routes as much as 15 percent. The carrier also is withdrawing its 2020 financial outlook, instituting a hiring freeze and suspending its stock repurchase program. Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference, Delta executives said that the global outbreak has cut net bookings by at least 25 percent, a drop-off they expect will worsen. Executives said most of the uncertainty surrounded domestic travel, with CEO Ed Bastian noting that the fear that’s now keeping travelers home is “more akin to what we saw at 9/11,” as opposed to some broader economic force. Live updates: U.S. stocks fluctuate after opening bounce American Airlines, meanwhile, said it will scale back peak summer international flying by 10 percent. Those cuts include a 55 percent reduction in trans-Pacific routes as the outbreak continues to exact a toll on China, South Korea and Japan. American will also reduce domestic flying in April by 7.5 percent. “Given American’s geographic exposure (74 percent domestic), we’re less concerned about the impact of the airline’s reduced service to Asian countries … and more concerned about decreased domestic capacity and demand,” Morningstar’s Brian Bernard wrote in an analyst note. Meanwhile, United Airlines said Tuesday that its CEO and president will forgo their base salaries through at least the end of June, and that it plans to cut 20 percent of flights indefinitely","Mar 10, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/delta-american-southwest-united-coronavirus/
12,Stocks Soar in Turbulent Trading a Day After Bruising Selloff - WSJ,Stocks Soar in Turbulent Trading a Day After Bruising Selloff. Indexes gained steam as afternoon wears on; crude oil and," Stocks soared in frenetic trading Tuesday, wiping out much of the losses they suffered just a day earlier in their biggest selloff since the financial crisis. The market opened sharply higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring nearly 1,000 points within the first few minutes of the opening bell. Stocks then erased the entirety of their gains before midday, only to charge higher again in the final hours of trading. To many analysts, the turbulent moves of the past few days suggest that riskier assets are still in the midst of a tenuous recovery that could take days to fully unfold—or ultimately wind up falling apart. The S&P 500 rose 135.67 points, or 4.9%, to 2882.23. At its lowest point Tuesday, the index was just 0.9% away from ending an 11-year bull market run that overcame issues ranging from a global trade war to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S.’s credit rating.

13,Global Fear of Flying Spawns Crisis for Airlines  - WSJ,"Global Fear of Flying Spawns Crisis for Airlines. As bookings fall sharply, carriers are cutting flights, grounding planes and trimming"," The coronavirus has suddenly and unexpectedly created the biggest challenge for the global airline industry since 9/11. Bookings around the world are falling sharply. U.S. carriers are following Asian and European airlines in cutting flights, grounding planes and enacting draconian cost reductions, such as hiring freezes and unpaid leave. Foreign airlines are looking for help from governments, banks and investors. Major airlines are trying to reassure passengers with promises of scrubbed cabins, filtered air and free-flowing hand sanitizer. “Delta has been preparing for such a scenario,” Delta Air Lines Inc. Chief Executive Ed Bastian wrote in an email to customers Sunday that outlined the airline’s response, insisting that travel “can’t—and shouldn’t— simply stop.” The International Air Transport Association, a trade body, estimates the virus could reduce passenger revenue world-wide this year by between $63 billion and $113 billion, or as much as 20%. As recently as last month, the trade group was forecasting a hit of less than $30 billion. The coronavirus has grounded 2,000 aircraft around the world, analysts at Jefferies estimate. By comparison, the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks cut airline revenues by 7%, or $23 billion, according to IATA. An eruption of an Icelandic volcano, which severely curtailed trans-Atlantic and European flying for six days in 2010, cost the industry $1.7 billion in lost revenue.","Mar 9, 2020",https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-fear-of-flying-spawns-crisis-for-airlines-11583772004
14,"Delta and other airlines slash flights, freeze hiring, park planes as virus cuts travel – Twin Cities",". . BUSINESS. Delta and other airlines slash flights, freeze hiring, park planes as virus cuts travel. . David Koenig.","    Airlines are slashing flights, freezing hiring and parking planes to cope with a stunning drop in bookings and a rise in cancellations caused by fear over the new virus outbreak. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly says the outbreak might be worse for airlines than the terror attacks of 2001. An industry trade group believes it will be more damaging. Delta Air Lines said Tuesday that travel demand has fallen so sharply in the past week that it expects one-third of seats to be empty this month on flights within the United States, which was insulated from virus fallout for a time. United Airlines expects to lose money in the first quarter for the first time in six years. United said ticket sales in the U.S. have dropped 25% in recent days — 70% after subtracting cancellations — and it’s even worse in Asia and Europe. Business travelers are grounded as meetings and conferences are canceled. Leisure travelers are scared. Normally airlines try to lure reluctant travelers by cutting fares, but that won’t work with the COVID-19 outbreak. “If you are scared of flying, you are probably scared at any price,” said Delta President Glen Hauenstein. Delta, the world’s biggest airline by revenue, said net bookings declined 25% to 30% in the past two weeks and could get worse. It will cut international flights by 20% to 25% and reduce U.S. flying by 10% to 15%, roughly matching cuts previously announced by United Airlines. Delta is parking some planes, cutting spending, freezing hiring, offering voluntary unpaid leave, delaying voluntary pension contributions and suspending share buybacks. American Airlines announced it will cut international flying by 10% this summer and reduce U.S. flying by 7.5% in April. It has delayed training of new pilots and flight attendants. United arranged $2 billion in additional bank credit to gain financial breathing room. The company’s worst-case planning is for a 70% drop in revenue in April and May, easing to 20% by December. The airline’s president, Scott Kirby, said United hopes the outbreak won’t be as damaging as 9/11, when bookings plunged 40% for two months before starting to recover, “but we’re not willing to count on that.” Kirby and United CEO Oscar Munoz will waive their base salaries through June, and Kelly, the Southwest CEO, said he will take a 10% pay cut.
