2,Why Shares of Allegiant Travel Were Up 73% in 2019 | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Allegiant Travel Were Up 73% in 2019. Strong airline operations eased Wall Street concerns about the company's,"   2019 was a good year for most airline stocks, but no company performed better than Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT). Shares of the discount airline and travel company gained 73.7% for the year, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, thanks to accelerating profits and progress made on some of the company's more ambitious initiatives.  ALGT DATA BY YCHARTS Allegiant historically has been a niche carrier, serving primarily second-tier markets, where competition is less robust and costs are lower. But the company's ambitions have been growing in recent years. Allegiant has been swapping out its older-generation MD-80 aircraft for newer, more efficient Airbus jets and expanding its presence in larger markets, where it faces more competition. The strategy worked throughout 2019. Allegiant beat consensus earnings estimates in all four quarterly announcements during the year. Revenue fell short of expectations during some quarters, in part due to issues related to transitioning to new planes and new schedules, but Allegiant showed good cost discipline that helped it consistently beat Wall Street profit expectations. The criticism of Allegiant in recent years has focused not on the airline's operations, but rather on its unique efforts to diversify. Allegiant is in the process of developing a 20-acre waterfront resort on the west coast of Florida at a cost of more than $450 million. ARTIST RENDERING OF ALLEGIANT'S PLANNED SUNSEEKER RESORT IN FLORIDA. IMAGE SOURCE: ALLEGIANT TRAVEL. Allegiant management is betting that by expanding into resorts, as well as making separate investments in golf and starting a chain of family-friendly restaurants, the company can capture a higher percentage of total vacation spend. But the high cost and uncertain nature of the plan has spooked some Wall Street analysts who would prefer management focus on expanding the airline. The stock's gain in 2019 came in part because development of the resort, known as Sunseeker, is progressing as planned without any unforeseen difficulties. Company president John Redmond told investors in October that Allegiant remains optimistic it will be able to monetize the resort once it is completed: We have approximately 800,000 active Sunseeker emails to date, which incredibly enough, we have more than 5,000 emails from over 30 different states. Of course, that speaks volumes about the breadth of the brand awareness and the power of a leisure carrier to develop a resort brand well before a resort opens.

5,Here’s Why The Stock Market Hit New Record Highs After Trump’s Comments On Iran,MORE FROM FORBES. Here’s Why The Stock Market Hit New Record Highs After Trump’s Comments On Iran. How A New,"Diffusing tensions helped Wall Street get back to winning ways. Topline: Despite stock futures plummeting overnight on reports that Iran launched a missile attack on U.S. military bases in Iraq, the market sharply rebounded on Wednesday. Stocks hit new record highs after Trump’s comments on Iran indicated a de-escalation of potential conflict.       PROMOTED       Crucial quote: “What initially seemed to be a large negative is actually now considered a small positive,” Crisafulli describes, as Iran’s retaliatory actions were minor and appear to be over for now. Crisafulli further notes that the current circumstances are not necessarily a good reason for the market to rally further but they should “help calm anxieties” while investors “are moving Iran to the periphery of the narrative” and shifting focus back to the November/December mindset when positive economic growth and central bank accomodation helped keep market momentum steady. Tangent: The Dow’s gains, however, were tempered by Boeing shares falling 1.3%, after a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 airliner burst into flames and crashed in Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people onboard. While airline stocks haven’t fared well with the Iran news (higher oil prices means higher prices for airplane fuel), war stocks—those of the big defense companies, like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman—have surged in recent days. Key background: The U.S. and Iran have been at odds since Trump backed out of the Obama-era nuclear deal in 2018. Tensions escalated to a boiling point last week, when Trump responded to a New Year’s Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad by ordering an air strike that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani last Thursday. That sent stocks plunging and oil prices surging on Friday, as the market’s strong start to the new year got derailed amid the escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Stocks recovered Monday, with major indexes ending the day up slightly, as Wall Street appeared content with the view that tensions with Iran will eventually cool down. Iran harshly condemned the air strikes and vowed to retaliate—and did so last night by launching more than a dozen missiles at U.S. military bases in Iraq. In his televised statement on Wednesday, Trump said no casualties were reported and that all American soldiers in the region were safe. He also called on NATO to get “much","Jan 8, 2020",https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/01/08/heres-why-the-stock-market-hit-new-record-highs-after-trumps-comments-on-iran/

7,Boeing sees $4.3 billion of market value erased after a fatal 737 crash in Iran | Markets Insider,. Boeing sees $4.3 billion of market value erased after a fatal 737 crash in Iran. SHARE THIS POST. Boeing,"   Nazanin Tabatabaee/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS  Boeing shares tanked as much as 2.3% on Wednesday, wiping out roughly $4.3 billion in market value in the wake of a fatal 737 crash in Iran. A Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 flying from Iran's Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport to Kyiv lost contact two minutes after taking off at 6:12 a.m. local time, according to the flight-tracking website FlightRadar24. The Ukrainian Embassy in Iran initially attributed the crash to a technical issue but later said the cause was unknown and under investigation. The flight had 167 passengers and nine crew members on board, including citizens from Canada, Sweden, Afghanistan, Germany, and the UK. All were killed in the crash.  The airline said it would post a list of passengers on its website ""after final confirmation of their presence on board of the aircraft."" One firm has already downgraded its rating for Boeing stock after the crash. The Cowen analyst Cai Von Rumohr knocked its rating for Boeing shares to ""market perform"" from ""buy,"" according to Bloomberg data, and pulled the firm's price target to $371 per share from $419. The new target implies a decrease of about 11% over the next 12 months. Boeing is already mired in the fallout from two crashes involving its 737 Max jet, the successor to the 737-800. The controversy has led to several congressional hearings, the firing of Boeing's CEO, and even speculation about a hit to US gross domestic product. The 737 Max remains grounded around the world as Boeing seeks to regain regulatory approval for the model. Read more: A former cocaine dealer turned real-estate investor shares how he leverages his Airbnb business to travel the world The crash happened hours after Iran fired over a dozen missiles at bases housing US troops in Iraq, retaliating against the US's assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Officials have distanced the 737 crash from the rising US-Iran tensions and from the possibility of terrorism.  Boeing traded at $332.75 per share as of 11:20 a.m. ET on Wednesday, up about 1.5% year-to-date. The plane manufacturer has 11 ""buy"" ratings, 15 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $367.43, according to Bloomberg data.

8,5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday,5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday. 1. S&P 500 futures turn positive after sinking overnight on,"S&P 500 futures turned higher Wednesday morning, coming back from an overnight drop of more than 1.6% after Iran retaliated for the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general. Strong ADP data on December private sector job growth was also providing stock futures support. In the immediate aftermath of Iran’s launching of more than a dozen ballistic missiles against two bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq on Tuesday night, Dow futures sank 400 points and international oil prices surged 4%. But like stocks, crude oil prices evened out as the Iranian attacks were less than feared. Oil actually turned negative Wednesday morning. There are no reports of any U.S. servicemembers being hurt in the Iranian strikes. President Donald Trump responded on Twitter: “All is well!” “Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far!” Trump plans to make a statement Wednesday morning. TRUMP TWEET A Boeing 737-800 passenger jet operated by a Ukrainian airline crashed minutes after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday morning. There were no survivors. Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 had 167 passengers and nine crew members on board. The cause of the crash was not immediately known and could take months to determine. However, state media in Iran reported that the jet went down because of technical problems without providing any more details. The plane is a different model than Boeing’s troubled 737 Max. Dow stock Boeing was down about 1% in premarket trading Wednesday after the Ukrainian airline crash in Iran. The drop in Boeing shares, which has been under sustained pressure since last year’s grounding of the 737 Max fleet after two deadly crashes involving those jets, was responsible for about a 20-point drag on Dow futures, which were pointing to a steady open Wednesday on Wall Street. Private payroll growth ended 2019 on a strong note, with companies adding 202,000 positions in December in another sign of a healthy labor market, according to a report Wednesday from ADP and Moody’s Analytics. The total was well above the 150,000 estimate. In addition to a solid December, ADP revised the initial November count of 67,000 up to 124,000.

Subsidiaries and associates[edit]. Business trends[edit]. Key people[edit].," Kenya Airways Ltd., more commonly known as Kenya Airways, is the flag carrier airline of Kenya.[3] The company was founded in 1977, after the dissolution of East African Airways. Its head office is located in Embakasi, Nairobi,[4] with its hub at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.[5] The airline was owned by the Government of Kenya until April 1995, and it was privatised in 1996, becoming the first African flag carrier to successfully do so.[6] Kenya Airways is currently a public-private partnership. The largest shareholder is the Government of Kenya (48.9%), 38.1% is owned by KQ Lenders Company 2017 Ltd. (in turn owned by a consortium of banks), followed by KLM, which has a 7.8% stake in the company. The rest of the shares are held by private owners; shares are traded on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, and the Uganda Securities Exchange.[6][7][8] The airline became a member of SkyTeam in June 2010, and is also a member of the African Airlines Association since 1977.[9][10] Kenya Airways was established by the Kenyan government on 22 January 1977, following the break-up of the East African Community and the consequent demise of East African Airways (EAA).[9][11][12] On 4 February 1977,[13]:90 two Boeing 707-321s leased from British Midland Airways inaugurated operations,[14] serving the Nairobi–Frankfurt–London route.[15] On internal and regional flights, the carrier deployed aircraft formerly operated by the EAA consortium, such as one Douglas DC-9-52 and three Fokker F-27-200s.[15][nb 1] In late 1977, three Boeing 707s were acquired from Northwest Orient.[17] The following year, the company formed a charter subsidiary named Kenya Flamingo Airlines, which leased aircraft from the parent airline in order to operate international passenger and cargo services.[18] Aer Lingus provided the company with technical and management support in the early years.[19] In July 1980 the airline had 2,100 employees and a fleet of three Boeing 707-320Bs, one Boeing 720B, one DC-9-30 and three Fokker F-27-200s. At this time, Addis Ababa, Athens, Bombay, Cairo, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Jeddah, Kampala, Karachi, Khartoum, London, Lusaka, Mauritius, Mogadishu, Rome, Salisbury, Seychelles and Zurich were among the airline's international destinations, whereas domestic routes radiated from Nairobi to Kisumu, Malindi, Mombasa and Mumias.[12] A Nairobi–Bombay nonstop route was launched in 1982 using Boeing 707-320Bs.[20] A year later, the company commenced serving Tanzania. Flights to Burundi, Malawi and Rwanda were launched in 1984. Capacity on the European routes was boosted in November 1985 with","Jan 8, 2020",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Airways

13,"Value Stocks - Overview, Metrics, and Value Investing",Value Stocks. What are Value Stocks?. Investing Metrics. 1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:. Price-to-Earnings Ratio = Stock Price / Total Earnings.,"Value stocks are stocks that are currently trading at a price lower than their actual intrinsic price. It basically means that the stocks are undervalued, i.e., traded at a price lower than their true value, making them an attractive investment option for investors.      The intrinsic value of a stock is its “real” value, i.e., true or calculated value. Below are several investing metrics that are used widely in the market to estimate a stock’s intrinsic value.   The three popular investing metrics used to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock are the P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and the Earnings Per Share (EPS).   The price to earnings (P/E) ratio is the most widely used investing metric in the investment world.     The P/E metric is a popular one because it establishes a relationship between a stock’s price and a company’s total earnings, giving a clear indication of whether it is an undervalued stock or not.   Another popular investing metric is the price to book (P/B) ratio. The P/B metric establishes a relationship between the stock’s price and its book value. It is also a very efficient way of determining whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued.     The book value of a company is determined by subtracting its total liabilities from its total assets.   Earnings per share is another popular investing metric used to determine a stock’s intrinsic value. It is calculated as follows:     A stock can be undervalued for many reasons. Common reasons we identified are cyclical businesses, seasonal businesses, market recessions, bad news, and market blind spots.   A cyclical business is a business where performance fluctuates with the business cycle. The first example is the airline industry. When the economy slows down, and consumers experience less disposable income, people tend to travel less to save money. Therefore, during economic downturns, airline companies can see lower stock prices due to slower demand.   A seasonal business is a business where performance fluctuates with the seasonal cycle (fall, winter, spring, summer). An example is an air-conditioning company. Its strong performance during the summer can be explained by the high demand for consumers wanting to cool down. During the winter, less demand for cooling can cause the stock price to be lower than what it usually","Jan 8, 2020",https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/value-stocks/

N O T E W O R T H Y   “Fill up the tank, please.”  I realized after I wrote this tagline, that unless you have filled up in New Jersey or Oregon you have probably not had to utter those words as they are the only states in the Union in which self filling is illegal.  No matter how you fill your tank, gasoline is still a major factor in the lives of many consumers. Yesterday, I wrote about the fact that crude oil prices are still relevant.  Today, I  want to bring that point home once again, given yesterday’s market action.  Quick recap: US kills top Iranian general, Iran gets mad and threatens hellfire. Realizing that “hellfire” might mean disruption on crude oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz, traders push crude oil prices up.  Higher prices of crude oil means that energy companies like Chevron and Phillips 66 would be less profitable causing their stock prices to go down.  In order to maintain their profitability, fuel prices would have to be raised, which is bad news for the airlines who rely on it to keep their planes in motion.  Airline stocks traded off.  That was Friday’s practical investment theme. Yesterday, traders reflected on past Middle East strife only to realize that, although stocks initially responded with volatility, long term trends usually persisted.  The President promised a swift response to any Iranian aggression, Iraq voted to kick US troops out of the country, a US memo surfaced stating that the US was going to leave Iraq, people around the world were upset that the President suggested that he would destroy cultural sites, the US said that the memo was just a draft and it was not leaving Iraq, the President’s people declared that he can legally do whatever he wanted, and finally the Secretary of Defense said that the President didn’t really mean that he would actually destroy cultural sites. Stocks bounced around throughout the procession of twisted and conflicting reports, but in the end, cool heads prevailed, oil prices came down","Jan 7, 2020",https://www.siebert.com/blog/index.php/2020/01/07/fuhgettaboutit/

JEFFREY HALLEY, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, ASIA","Discover Thomson Reuters More By Reuters Staff 7 MIN READ SINGAPORE (Reuters) - An Iranian rocket attack on U.S. forces based in Iraq has sent markets into turmoil and investors racing for safety. Here are analyst views on the market moves: “The weight of money is counting on a replay of the price-action on Monday. Essentially people are betting that this is not going to be our main focus three months from now.” DAVID KOTOK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CUMBERLAND ADVISORS, FLORIDA “The market looks at...single events and doesn’t say it is a sequence intensifying to larger scale war. It is pricing in tension and risk but not the development of larger scale war.” JAMES MCGLEW, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CORPORATE STOCKBROKING, ARGONAUT, PERTH “We are getting exaggerated moves but that’s of course volatility playing. Markets simply hate uncertainty. It’s an old adage but it definitely holds true in the current situation - markets can price risks but they can’t price uncertainty. “I don’t think it’s going to be a bloodbath in the equities market but this volatility certainly takes the wind out of the sails.” CLIFF TAN, EAST ASIAN HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKETS RESEARCH, MUFG, HONG KONG “I think the market yesterday was very short-sighted. I don’t know any serious analyst who’s looked at Iran for a while who didn’t expect any kind of retaliation. Unfortunately, I’m not sure if this round (of retaliation) will be the last round.” “Expect equities to take a hit, especially in imported energy-dependent Asia. Airline stocks will be out of favor today because of oil, but that won’t be the whole story. “The potential closure of the Straits of Hormuz - Iran has plenty of land-based anti-ship missiles - will severely disrupt oil supplies from the Middle East. We may also see next week’s signing of the interim U.S.-China trade agreement in Washington DC delayed.” KAY VAN-PETERSEN, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, SAXO CAPITAL MARKETS, SINGAPORE “That’s the key risk, that they maybe kill Americans, and the U.S. strikes Iran and then they do something else that again is kind of direct. But I don’t think it takes us to a market rout. It makes it a little bit tougher to play the bounce, but it’s still going to be the same old move at the end of the day. “I guess the biggest risk is actually just something else entering...I just think for proper risk-off, you’re","Jan 7, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-markets-instant-view-idUSKBN1Z708S
