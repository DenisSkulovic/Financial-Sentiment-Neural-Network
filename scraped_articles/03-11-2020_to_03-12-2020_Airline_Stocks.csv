Discover Thomson Reuters By Reuters Staff 2 MINUTES DE LECTURE LONDON (Reuters) - European airline stocks plunged as much as 20% on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would restrict travel from Europe to the United States for 30 days to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The surprise move is another setback for a sector that has been battered by earlier travel restrictions across the world and has been battling falling passenger volumes due to the virus outbreak, now declared a pandemic. Credit Suisse analyst Neil Glynn said the transatlantic route was “the primary profit engine” for European airlines. With 20% to 30% of their passenger revenues coming from that route, Glynn highlighted the damage that would be inflicted in the coming weeks, and potentially well into the summer. Trump's move sent shivers through stock markets, with the pan-European STOXX 600 .STOXX dropping 5%, mainly dragged down by the travel and leisure sector .SXTP. Air France KLM AIRF.PA shares, which have lost nearly 60% of their value since the coronavirus outbreak reached Europe, dropped another 15% to August 2012 lows. Germany's Lufthansa LHAG.DE and British Airways and Iberia-owner IAG ICAG.L both fell 9.5%. Cruise operator Carnival CCL.L plunged to 11-year lows. Shares in Norwegian Air Shuttle NWC.OL, which operates transatlantic flights, also lost a fifth of their value. The airline sector has been hit hardest by the outbreak of coronavirus, with falling ticket demand and Italy in lockdown forcing carriers to cancel routes and slash costs to try to survive the mounting crisis.

4,Best Airline ETFs to Buy 2020,2020 Investing Guide for Airline ETFs. Learn More About Airline ETFs and Which Funds to Buy Now. What Are Airline," Investing in airline ETFs can be a smart way for investors to gain access to stocks of companies in the airline industry. The best airline ETFs for 2020 will have a combination of high assets and low expenses, compared to similar funds investing in the airline industry. But before investing in funds that concentrate on one sector, it’s important to understand how these sector funds work.  Airline ETFs are exchange-traded funds that invest primarily in stocks of companies in the airline industry, which may include those involved in passenger airline services, airliner manufacturing, air freight and logistics, airport services, and related companies in the transportation industry. Examples of airline industry stocks include names like Delta Airlines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), and American Airlines (AAL). Like most ETFs, airline ETFs typically track the performance of an underlying index, which in this case would include airline industry company stocks. The passive nature of index-based ETFs can provide low-cost access to a basket of securities, as opposed to investing in individual securities. Consumer spending is nearly 70% of the US economy.1﻿ This means that the performance of many airline stocks will often depend upon the collective financial health and sentiment of consumers.  When consumers are in a spending mood, they are more likely to buy goods and services that are not necessities, such as long-distance travel. The airline industry is a part of the broader transportation sector, as well as the consumer cyclical sector for stocks. Cyclical stocks rise and fall with upswings and recessions, respectively.  Since long-distance travel is not a necessity for most consumers, airline stocks have greater potential for growth when the economy is strong, hence the cyclical stock categorization. When the economy is slow or weakening, cyclical stocks may not perform as well as the overall stock market. The outlook for the broader economy in 2020 is healthy; however, investors should note that the Federal Reserve has forecasted economic growth to slow as the year progresses. If consumers reduce discretionary spending as the economy decelerates, consumer cyclical stocks—such as airline stocks—could also see smaller returns compared to recent years. With that said, airline ETFs can still be a part of a diversified long-term portfolio of investments. The best airline ETFs will have a combination of concentrated exposure to the airline industry and low expenses. These key characteristics could indicate quality ETFs that can accurately track","Mar 11, 2020",https://www.thebalance.com/best-airline-etfs-to-buy-4685252

9,President Donald Trump Bans European Air Travel. What It Means for Airline Stocks.  | Barron's,"Trump Bans European Air Travel. Airline Stocks Are Getting Crushed.. . . 8 Hardware Stocks to Buy for 2021, According","    President Donald Trump banned travel from Europe to the U.S. as part of new actions intended to halt the spread of Covid-19 coronavirus in America. “The European Union failed to take the same precautions [as America] and restrict travel from China. As a result, a large number of clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe,” Trump said in his Wednesday evening televised address. “We will be suspending all travel to Europe from U.S. for the next 30 days.” The ban doesn’t apply to flights from the United Kingdom. United Airlines Holdings (ticker: UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and American Airlines Group (AAL) are the three domestic carriers most directly affected by the news. The trio generate about 15% of sales from trans-Atlantic business. The revenue figures line up, roughly speaking, with capacity. Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent estimates that trans-Atlantic capacity—excluding the U.K.—amount to about 17% of Delta’s second quarter capacity compared with 13% for United and 10% for American. Airline capacity shifts regionally over the course of the year. Travel demand usually picks up in the Spring and Summer seasons. United, among the three, generates the most sales as a percentage of sales, followed by Delta and then American. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue Airways (JBLU), and Alaska Air Group (ALK) generate most of their sales inside of the U.S. Airlines have been among the hardest-hit sectors by the coronavirus outbreak. Their stocks are down between 33% and 53% year to date, worse than the drops of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 over the same span. The sector was pummeled again Thursday. United stock dropped about 25%, Delta shares fell 21%. American shares fell 17%. Southwest, JetBlue, and Alaska Air dropped 18%, on average. The closest demand shock for U.S. airlines—similar to the magnitude of Covid-19—might be the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Total U.S. airline revenue fell about $13 billion, or about 14%, in 2001 in the aftermath of the attacks. The industry swung from a 2000 full-year profit of about $2.4 billion to a loss of about $7.7 billion the next year. The U.S. airline industry is about twice as large as it was in 2001, as measured by sales. It’s also about four times as profitable. A similar reduction in sales and earnings could wipe about $20 billion in sales. Losses are likely too, but they shouldn’t be","Mar 12, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-bans-european-air-travel-heres-what-it-means-for-airline-stocks-51583980976

11,Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Loses $3 Billion in Airline Stocks,. Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Loses $3 Billion in Airline Stocks. More From Entrepreneur. Latest On Entrepreneur. 5 Ways to,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway suffered another blow this week after President Donald Trump announced restrictions on European travel to the US in response to the coronavirus threat, sending airline stocks into a tailspin. The famed investor's conglomerate counts Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and American Airlines among its 25 biggest holdings, and the quartet made up about 4% of its portfolio at the end of December. Berkshire owned more than 8% of each of the four companies at the end of December, and together those shares were worth about $10 billion at that time, according to Gurufocus. However, shares in American and United have more than halved in value since the start of this year, and Delta and Southwest stocks have tumbled by more than 25%, as coronavirus fears continue to weigh on travel demand. As a result, the value of Berkshire's holdings has dropped by more than a third to about $6.3 billion. If the pandemic continues to plague airline stocks, that loss could grow. Buffett won't be too worried. He recently argued that investors should celebrate the chance to buy quality stocks at a lower price. Berkshire also plowed another $45 million into Delta stock last month after it plunged 20% due to coronavirus. The breakout of an oil-price war between Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other oil producers also promises to boost airlines' profits by slashing their fuel costs. Moreover, the Trump administration has promised to support airlines along with other industries suffering from the coronavirus outbreak.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   The impact of the coronavirus woes may have loomed large on the U.S. airlines industry for the past few weeks and still continues unabated but the industry is well-equipped to overcome such setbacks. In fact, steps have already been taken to contain the economic damage that this black swan event poses to the country’s major airline operators. All these actions are expected to be reflected ahead. Despite how the airlines industry may fare at present, there’s no better time to dive into these stocks than it is right now. This is because certain quality airline stocks are now trading much below their worth. In addition, the nosedive suffered by these stocks is a temporary blip that is expected to turn around soon. Coronavirus Impact on Airlines The fast-spreading disease has taken a toll on businesses for a while now, especially on companies that are integral to the travel sector, such as airlines. Airlines companies witnessed a significant drop in passenger traffic over the past few weeks as customers cancel their bookings and corporates prefer online meetings to face-to-face interactions. In just a month, shares of some of the giant air carriers, such asLATAM Airlines Group S.A. LTM, Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE and American Airlines Group Inc. AAL have shed more than 40%. Decrease in travel demands across continents is hampering airline business. In addition, earlier this week, President Donald Trump temporarily suspended travel from most of Europe to the United States. The restrictions are expected to be effective Mar 13 and last for 30 days. Per The Guardian, these restrictions are applicable to primarily foreigners who paid a visit to the enlisted 26 countries in the Schengen area during the past two weeks before their planned arrival in the United States. These travel restrictions could impact airline stocks in the near term. However gloomy the airlines industry may appear right now, the space is looking for a recovery ahead.

'Real killer blow': Global airline stocks plunge on Trump's travel ban and analysts expect a '30%-50%' drop. Airlines have,"   Reuters  Airline stocks across the globe are plunging after US President Donald Trump announced travel restrictions from several countries in Europe in order to curb the growing risk of coronavirus.  On Wednesday, Trump announced that the US will ban all travel from 26 European countries by non-US citizens and permanent residents.  While global stocks slipped into turmoil, individual airline stocks nosedived on the news. On Thursday, the European travel and leisure index was down 10% with major airlines such as Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways-owned IAG down more than 10%. Shares in plane-maker Airbus dropped 9% in the morning trading.   ""The real blood bath is going to be in the travel and leisure industry. I am expecting this industry to fall as much as 30% to 50%,"" Naeem Aslam, chief markets analyst at AvaTrade told Business Insider on Thursday.  ""Out of all the other sectors, this could be the most fruitful short trade for investors given the global lockdown situation that we are facing because of coronavirus. I expect bigger companies to take advantage of the available credit lines now and buy smaller players. So, towards the end of this year or third quarter, we are likely to hear more mergers and acquisition news."" Stateside, Boeing shares dropped 42% in pre-market trading. Meanwhile, major airlines were also down across the board. United Airlines dropped more than 10%, while Delta was down more than 6% in pre-market trading.  ""Coming after such a torrid time for airline stocks the ban is a real killer blow. We don't know how long it will last, and the Transatlantic business is so huge. Those with good balance sheets will be ok, but there are plenty of airlines that are not in good shape and will go under,"" Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, told Business Insider on Wednesday.  The global airline industry has been on a rollercoaster ride since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. According to Russ Mould, Investment Director at AJ Bell, the global airline industry has lost more than $40 billion of its value in one month.

Could the Oracle of Omaha point his elephant gun","   Warren Buffett famously said when others are fearful it's time to get greedy. The COVID-19 coronavirus has sparked a wave of selling through the airline industry, with investors terrified today's industry leaders will soon go the way of Pan Am, Braniff, or TWA. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) reacted in the early days of the sell-off, buying up 976,000 shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in late February. But the airline stocks have fallen significantly further in the weeks since. Could the Oracle of Omaha soon aim his legendary ""elephant gun"" at the airline industry and buy an airline outright? And if so, what company is the most likely to be acquired? IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL Berkshire Hathaway has more than $128 billion in cash on hand, and Buffett appears to be looking for one more big deal before he retires. He's shown an interest in transports and aerospace in the past, adding Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad in 2010 for $26 billion and Precision Castparts in 2016 for $37 billion. Buffett downplayed the talk of buying an airline outright during a Feb. 26 interview on CNBC, noting the high level of regulation in the industry and saying that creates ""complications"" in transactions. But that's not a firm denial. Buffett is a value investor at heart, and shares of the four airlines currently in his portfolio have fallen an additional 12% to 26% since he gave that interview. Buffett has been known to change his mind about airlines in the past. In his 2007 letter to investors he called the airline sector un-investible, famously saying ""if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down."" Thirteen years later, the four largest U.S. airlines make up a sizable part of the Berkshire portfolio. Most of the parlor talk about Buffett and the airline business in years past has focused around Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), a longtime industry maverick that has matured into one of the ""big four"" dominating the U.S. domestic industry. Berkshire is the second largest holder of Southwest shares. Southwest offers simplicity, flying only one type of aircraft to mostly domestic and Caribbean destinations. It eschews the complexity of international alliances, has a reputation for not nickel and diming customers, and is the closest thing in the airline industry to the folksy-feel that","Mar 12, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/12/stocks-plunging-now-warren-buffett-buys-airline.aspx

STAY INFORMED. . . . . . .,"Warren Buffett had the worst day in years on Wednesday after the U.S. stock market plummeted into the bear market. Ankit Agrawal/Mint via Getty Images Over the past few days, the rapidly spreading coronavirus Covid-19 has forced almost every major airline in the U.S. to slash flights and accommodate last-minute reservation changes as governments around the world impose travel restrictions to hard-hit regions and advise people to avoid nonessential travel. These abrupt changes have sent airline stocks into free fall this week amid a market-wide slide triggered by the coronavirus. But Warren Buffett, veritably America’s smartest investor, is betting that the coronavirus impact on air travel will be only temporary. SEE ALSO: Warren Buffett To Host 40,000-Person Shareholder Meeting Despite Coronavirus Last month, Buffett’s investment conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, bought a sizable stake of Delta Air Lines after its shares tumbled 20 percent amid the coronavirus selloff. The stake made Berkshire the largest shareholder in Delta. The firm is also the second largest shareholder in United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Those positions seem like an outright contradiction to Buffett’s famous saying that the aerospace sector has “proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers” and is therefore “a bottomless pit” for shareholder capital. “Perhaps the legendary value investor just can’t resist scooping up cheap shares,” The Wall Street Journal commented. “U.S. airline stocks have traded at record-low valuations relative to the broader stock market for some months.” Meanwhile, some investors speculate that the coronavirus outbreak could reduce business air travel for good and make work-from-home a permanent arrangement for some jobs. As tens of millions of people start working remotely to reduce Covid-19 risk, demand for virtual meeting and messaging softwares is skyrocketing. Video conferencing startup Zoom, for example, has seen its share price jump 20 percent in the past month despite a market rout. Usage of similar tools made by Microsoft, Google, Uber and other companies has also surged since the coronavirus outbreak.
