Review & Preview. . .","  Every weekday evening we highlight the consequential market news of the day and explain what's likely to matter tomorrow.  Expect transportation and logistics
shares to drop as energy prices soar—airline stocks are down about 4% following the weekend attacks in Saudi Arabia—yet some logistics stocks could be attractive as things settle down.  Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN) could be an unexpected casualty. Energy futures took off after airstrikes on Saudi Arabia—the largest oil producer in OPEC—knocked out more than 5 million barrels per day of crude-oil production, or about 5% of global output, on Saturday. The kingdom is working to bring its production back on line as soon as possible. Energy is a key expense item for truckers, railroads and airlines because it takes a lot of energy to move goods and people around the economy. American Airlines (ticker: AAL), for instance, has spent more than $3.7 billion on jet fuel, more than 16% of sales generated, during the first six months of 2019. Union Pacific (UNP), has spent $1.1 billion, 10% of sales, on fuel. And United Parcel Service (UPS) has spent $1.6 billon, about 5% of sales, during the first half of this year. The large energy exposures make oil prices a big topic for transport investors. Truckers and railroad operators have an easier time passing fuel costs along to their business customers. Most operators of logistics networks use explicit fuel surcharges to mitigate commodity risk. “Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $399 million, down $13 million when compared with 2018,” said Union Pacific CFO Robert Knight during the company’s second-quarter earnings conference call. Railroads and trucking companies generally discuss their profit margins exclusive of the cost of fuel, so investors tend not to factor those expenses into their views of the stocks. For railroads and truckers, the profit margin discussion usually happens on an ex-fuel basis. Airlines have a more difficult time passing fuel expenses along. Airlines have larger energy exposures, and consumer demand for air travel is sensitive to changes in ticket prices. The good news for airlines, as well as other logistics providers, is that everyone is in those industries is in the same situation. Aside from some differences in their fleets’ fuel efficiency and hedging policies, all airlines, railroads and truckers pay the same prices for energy. Higher prices aren’t a competitive disadvantage for anyone. If demand isn’t affected—and that’s a big if—prices and energy","Sep 16, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airlines-shipping-stocks-fall-as-oil-soars-amazon-could-be-hit-too-51568641111
2,Saudi Oil Attack Could Impact Airline Stocks,Saudi Oil Attack Could Impact Airline Stocks. Airlines’ fuel costs will rise . Saudi oil attack could trigger other issues.,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO US airline stocks might fall significantly today. The attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil refinery on Saturday could have a negative impact on the airline industry. On September 14, Saudi Arabia faced a drone strike on Saudi Aramco—its largest oil refinery. The strike caused the facility’s production to shut down immediately, which removed approximately 5% of the daily global output, according to Bloomberg. According to Bloomberg, the drone strike caused the single-worst disruption in oil markets ever. Saudi Aramco has lost nearly 5.7 million barrels per day of petroleum output due to the production shutdown. The loss exceeded the “loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi petroleum supply in August 1990” and the “loss of Iranian oil output in 1979.” Following the news, crude oil prices rose due to disruption fears in the oil market. WTI and Brent crude oil prices gained nearly 10% each from the closing prices on September 13. An upswing in oil prices would have a direct impact on airlines. Notably, fuel accounts for nearly 25% of airlines’ overall operating expenses. Airlines have been enjoying the benefit of low crude prices this year compared to 2018. Last year, from January 1 to September 13, the average WTI and Brent prices were $66.5 and $72, respectively. However, during the same period this year, the average WTI and Brent prices are $57 and $65, respectively. More than a 10% YoY decline in crude prices helped airlines partially offset the negative impact from Boeing’s (BA) troubled 737 MAX jets. Notably, American Airlines (AAL), Southwest (LUV), and United Airlines’ (UAL) fuel costs fell 4.4%, 3.6%, and 4.4%, respectively, in the second quarter. Together, the three companies have faced over 25,000 flight cancelations during the second quarter due to the worldwide grounding of the 737 MAX jets. Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft has faced a global flying ban since mid-March following two horrific accidents within five months. However, United Airlines and American Airlines recorded an improvement in their respective pre-tax margins due to lower fuel costs. United Airlines and American Airlines’ adjusted second-quarter pre-tax margin expanded by 200 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. Southwest’s second-quarter pre-tax margin remained almost flat YoY at 16.4%. Therefore, a sudden increase in the fuel cost due to the Saudi oil attack could have a massive impact on airlines’ profitability in upcoming quarters. The extent of the losses will depend on how fast Saudi","Sep 16, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/09/saudi-oil-attack-could-impact-airline-stocks/

CNBC Newsletters","Shares of industries with high fuel costs like airlines and cruise lines dropped Monday as crude oil and gasoline futures spiked following the weekend attack on Saudi oil installations. Shares of retailers fell on fears that higher gasoline costs will hurt sales and squeeze profits. Oil prices are soaring after the drone attacks forced Saudi Arabia to cut its oil output in half. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose as much as 19.5% to $71.95 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures climbed as much as 15.5% to $63.34. U.S. gasoline futures surged more than 9%. The attacks mark the largest disruption to the world oil supply in history, knocking out about 5.7 million barrels per day. American Airlines fell 7.28%, Delta Airlines was down 1.57%, United Airlines fell 2.84% and Alaska Air dropped 1.87% on Monday. Evercore ISI said a spike in oil prices could “require a reset of revenue expectations” for airlines. “Higher fuel serves as a healthy reminder of the volatility of the inputs and may prove timely as carriers contemplate ’20 growth plans and cadence of Max returns,” said Evercore’s Duane Pfennigwerth in a note to clients Monday, referring to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. Cowen said in a note Monday that American Airlines will be the most affected by the surge in oil prices because it’s the world’s largest consumer of jet fuel. “Jet fuel is ~15 cents per gallon higher today than it was on Friday and we expect the US airline stocks to be pressured until they are able to offset the cost of fuel,” Cowen equity researcher Helane Becker said in a note to clients. Cruise-ship stocks also ticked lower on Monday. Carnival Corp lost 3.22% and Royal Caribbean dropped 0.82%. Shares of retailers Walmart, Dollar General and Amazon were also lower on Monday.  Meanwhile, Devon Energy jumped 12.17%, Marathon Oil rose 11.57%, Cimarex Energy climbed 12.18%, Concho Resources was up 3.52% and Diamondback Energy jumped 8.6%. Morgan Stanley said exploration and production companies are the best positioned within the energy sector to capture the benefit of the short-term rally in oil prices. Occidental Petroleum rose 6%, Chesapeake Energy rose 15.7%, Callon Petroleum rose 17.96%, Oasis Petroleum was 29% higher and Whiting Petroleum jumped 49.14%. “While higher leverage and cost structure mid-cap stocks might rally most in response to the price spike, we continue to prefer low","Sep 16, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/16/airlines-retail-and-cruise-shares-fall-refiners-surge-as-spiking-crude-will-lift-fuel-costs.html
4,American Airlines Stock Forecast - Financhill,. American Airlines Stock Forecast. American Airlines: Fly Back In Time. AAL Has Been A Rough Ride For Investors .,"American Airlines Stock Forecast: As a whole, the airline industry is having an unexpectedly tough year. Normally, when the economy is humming along, commercial airlines can count on filling seats with travelers on business and leisure pursuits. Better yet, cargo planes are in high demand for moving goods across the country and around the world to their intended markets. Unfortunately, trade friction between the US and China has taken a heavy toll on cargo demand in 2019. Growth in cargo has come to a full stop, after rising 3.4 percent in 2018 and 9.7 percent in 2017. In June, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) dropped its 2019 industry profit outlook from $35.5 billion to $28 billion – a year over year decrease from 2018’s $30 billion. The September 2019 attack on a Saudi Arabian oil facility hasn’t helped matters. Airlines are especially vulnerable to increases in oil prices, and American Airlines is no exception. As American’s stock prices trend downward, investors are debating whether this is the right time to buy. American Airlines [NASDAQ: AAL] has an impressive history. The company’s very first flight took place on April 15, 1926, and it was piloted by Charles Lindbergh. For a decade, American was limited to carrying mail from St. Louis to Chicago with some minor forays into passenger service. In 1936, that all changed. American Airlines founder C.R. Smith had been working with engineer and aviation pioneer Donald Douglas to transform passenger airplanes. Together, they created the DC-3.  American’s first commercial flight from New York to Chicago occurred on June 25, 1936, and an industry was born. American Airlines started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 10, 1939. Since then, American Airlines has continued to innovate, and the company is credited with many air industry firsts. American was first to offer nonstop transcontinental service across the U.S., and it was first to create a dedicated educational facility for flight attendants. American hired the first African-American commercial airline pilot in 1964, and it designed the first airline loyalty program. American Airlines [NASDAQ: AAL] weathered some difficult times in 2011, and it was forced to declare bankruptcy. By 2014, the company was profitable again, and in 2015, American Airlines Group replaced Allergan on the S&P 500. The next year, American was featured by Fortune magazine as number one on the Best Business Turnaround list.

The attack, which involved 10 automated drones, wiped about half of the state-owned Saudi Aramco's supply, or 5.7 million barrels a day. It was claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, but U.S. officials suspect it originated in Iran. President Trump has authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and is pushing for approvals of oil pipelines in the country to be expedited. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve consists of 645 million barrels stored thousands of feet underground and was created in 1975 after the Arab Oil Embargo for shocks to the market such as this.

Hong Kong’s benchmark tumbled 1.1% while Seoul advanced and Shanghai and Sydney were little-changed. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.   The benchmark U.S. crude price jumped more than $5 per barrel following the attack on oil producer Saudi Aramco’s Abqaiq facility, for which Yemeni rebels claimed responsibility. Brent crude, the international standard, was up $6 after spiking nearly $8 at one point.   The jump in crude prices hurt airline stocks and other businesses with big fuel bills and put upward pressure on inflation expectations. At the same time, higher prices are a boost to oil exporters such as Malaysia and temporarily pushed up share prices for crude producers.   “This is obviously not a good day if you are an oil importer,” said Christ Weston of Pepperstone Group in a report.   “This isn’t just a question of who or even what actually caused the attacks, but some have questioned whether we will we see further attacks and Saudi infrastructure is vulnerable,” said Weston.

16,Global stocks slip as oil prices surge,Asian markets mixed as oil prices surge,"BEIJING (AP) — Global stock markets sank Monday after crude prices surged following an attack on Saudi Arabia's biggest oil processing facility. Market benchmarks in Europe dropped after Asian markets mostly closed lower, while Wall Street futures were down slightly. Shanghai's index was unchanged, and Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. Benchmark U.S. crude jumped $4.64 per barrel to $59.49 following the attack on oil producer Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq facility for which Yemeni rebels claimed responsibility. Brent crude, the international standard, was up $5.37 after spiking nearly $8 at one point, to trade at $65.59. That hurt airline stocks and other businesses with big fuel bills and pushed up inflation expectations. At the same time, higher crude prices are a boost to oil-exporting companies and countries. ""This is obviously not a good day if you are an oil importer,"" said Chris Weston of Pepperstone Group in a report. ""This isn't just a question of who or even what actually caused the attacks, but some have questioned whether we will we see further attacks and Saudi infrastructure is vulnerable,"" said Weston. In Europe, London's FTSE 100 lost 0.2% to 7,350 and Frankfurt's DAX retreated 0.6% to 12,396. France's CAC 40 lost 0.7% to 5,613. On Wall Street, the futures for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index and for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down 0.4%. In Asia, the Hang Seng index was off 0.8% at 27,124.55 after dropping 1.1% at one point following more anti-government protests. The Hong Kong airport reported passenger traffic fell 12% in August from a year ago, a sign of the economic impact of demonstrations that began three months ago. ""Oil ructions aside, investors would have already been nervous today in Asia as a belligerent China returns from holiday,"" Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report. The Shanghai Composite Index was off 0.5 points at 3,030.75 as trading resumed following a three-day holiday weekend. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 was up 4 points at 6,673.50. Seoul's Kospi gained 0.6% to 2,062.22 while India's Sensex lost 0.7% to 37,111.12. Taiwan advanced and Southeast Asian markets retreated.

EOG,"    Oil stocks are soaring as drone strikes on key facilities in Saudi Arabia threaten to upend the global market for the treasured commodity. Crude future prices spiked as much 20% following the attack. Saudi Arabia is responsible for close to 6% of the world's total oil production, and the damaged facility could potentially disrupt output for several weeks. But the timeline for repairs is still unknown. ""If production can be restored quickly, we'd expect oil prices to rally several dollars as the market prices-in increased geopolitical risk,"" analysts from Credit Suisse said in a note to clients. They continued: ""If Saudi Arabia requires an extended period of time to restore production, we would expect prices to spike in order to thwart demand, as spare capacity is insufficient to offset the sustained loss."" The firm also ranked companies who stand to gain from a rise in prices in order of whose cash flow per share would rise the most in the event oil prices jumped $5 per barrel.

A brief history of BSE","Watch a complete video on our webinar on 'Investing In The Post Covid-19 World. What's Next For Investors?'. Watch Now Some of the common questions which prevails across minds of most equity investors, especially the new ones are “Where should I invest in stocks in India?” and “Should I invest in stocks on NSE or BSE?” As you might already know NSE and BSE are top stock exchanges in India. NSE established in 1992, is the biggest stock exchange in India, while BSE is the oldest stock exchange in India which was established in 1875. Apart from the two, earlier there were many other stock exchanges in India like the Hyderabad Stock Exchange, Bangalore Stock Exchange Ltd., Coimbatore Stock Exchange Ltd., Mangalore Stock Exchange Ltd., Ludhiana Stock exchange Ltd., Gauhati Stock Exchange Ltd. etc. which have become defunct. There are over 1700 companies listed on NSE while over 5500 companies are listed on BSE. It does not really matter which exchange you choose to invest in stocks as both exchanges are equally good in terms of the services they offer to investors. Rather than looking at the exchange, one should choose the stock for investment very carefully because that is what actually matters the most.

This reminds me of a famous story.

A man used to sell helium balloons of different colours outside the village. Whenever his sales were down, he used to release a balloon in the air. Seeing the balloon in the air, children in the village would come and buy balloons from him. One day a little boy asked him “Uncle if you release a black balloon in the air, would it still go up?”

The balloon seller replied “Son it is not the colour of the balloon which matters. It is what is inside which matters”.

Similarly the exchange which you choose to invest in stocks does not matter. Both BSE and NSE are equally good and offer a robust technology platform for buying and selling stocks.

However, investors should note that there is always a minor price difference between NSE and BSE. For example if XYZ stock is trading at Rs.100 on NSE the price displayed could by Rs.99.

Irrespective of this difference in price, the brokerage charged by the broker and the Securities Transaction Tax remain the same on both NSE and BSE. Volumes of shares traded on NSE are generally high, so it would be a good thing to",14 hours ago,https://researchandranking.com/blog/invest-in-stocks
