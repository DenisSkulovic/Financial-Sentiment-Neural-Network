0,"Stocks With Travel Perks for Shareholders
                                                       | AAII",. Discussion,"         Depending on the stock you own, there may be more benefits than just the potential for price appreciation, a possible dividend and the ability to vote on shareholder issues. You could get discounts, special access or other goodies. A good example is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A), whose portfolio companies offer shareholder-only discounts. (I wrote about my experience at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting weekend earlier this year.) A much lesser known shareholder benefit is offered by the major cruise line companies. Carnival Corp. (CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) all offer onboard credits to investors who own at least 100 shares. The credit varies by the length of the cruise. For a seven-day cruise, the onboard credit is $100 on each cruise line. (Carnival is held in the Stock Superstars Report portfolio, though not because of the onboard credit.)

Here’s where you can find details about the perks: • Carnival (includes Carnival, Princess, Holland America and Cunard, among others)

• Norwegian (includes Norwegian, Oceania and Regent)

• Royal Caribbean (includes Royal Caribbean, Celebrity and Azamara)

The topic came up while my wife and I were discussing vacation plans over the weekend. When one of our friends said he thought such a perk existed, I searched online and quickly found the information. It also prompted me to wonder if other companies offer shareholder travel perks. So, I did some additional searching. None of the publicly traded U.S. airlines offer shareholder benefits (not even waiving baggage fees or priority boarding). Neither do travel website companies such as Expedia Group Inc. (EXPE) or theme park companies. Walt Disney Co. (DIS) evidently used to offer discounts to its theme parks, but no longer. My wife is a Disney shareholder (I bought her a share just before the company stopped issuing paper certificates of its stock) and we’ve never been notified of any perks. The only exchange-listed hotel company offering its shareholders perks is InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG). The company offers shareholders discounted stays at all of its hotels, including Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and InterContinental. You will need to hold your shares in certified form, in your sole name and be registered as such with the InterContinental Hotels Group’s registrar. On the destination front, Oregon’s Willamette Valley Vineyards Inc. (WVVI) offers its shareholders admissions to special events and use of its tasting and","Sep 5, 2019",https://www.aaii.com/investor-update/article/Stocks-With-Travel-Perks-for-Shareholders
1,Is Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Potentially Undervalued? - Simply Wall St News,Is Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Potentially Undervalued?. Is Southwest Airlines still cheap?. What kind of growth will Southwest Airlines generate?.,"Let's talk about the popular Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to $54.91 at one point, and dropping to the lows of $47.6. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Southwest Airlines's current trading price of $52.1 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Southwest Airlines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines Good news, investors! Southwest Airlines is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $102.4, but it is currently trading at US$52.10 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Southwest Airlines’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Southwest Airlines’s earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 25%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. Are you a shareholder? Since LUV is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LUV for a while, now might be the","Sep 6, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-luv/southwest-airlines/news/is-southwest-airlines-co-nyseluv-potentially-undervalued
2,3 Stocks Poised to Soar With Incoming 5G - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . 3 Stocks Poised to Soar With Incoming 5G. Sierra Wireless. Telus. BlackBerry.,"      Amy Legate-Wolfe | September 6, 2019 | More on: SWIR BB TU BB SW T Do you remember dial up? It seems like only yesterday I would have to ask my parents to hang up the phone if I wanted to work on a school project via internet. Yet today, here I am, communicating with people around the world, writing articles and sending them off within moments thanks to today’s internet connection. Yet things are set to get even faster. The introduction of 5G is being touted as a huge boost for tech executives around the world, providing the ability to usher in even more tech applications. For example, you can’t have an autonomous car if it needs to wait and download the map ahead. With 5G, that’s now possible as the download would be all but instantaneous. And that’s only the beginning. Canada won’t be left out. In fact, here are three companies that stand to gain quite a bit with the introduction of 5G. Let’s start with the obvious with Sierra Wireless (TSX:SW)(NASDAQ:SWIR), the company that would be actually creating the 5G modules many people would be using. Sierra already provides device-to-cloud services for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is now working with Qualcomm to create this new module. Sierra has a proven track recording of providing top of the line services in IoT, aiming to “reduce complexity, turn data into intelligence and get [clients] connected products and services to market faster.” Yet despite this news, the company has lagged recently as Sierra continues to go through restructuring. This had led investors to fear the company won’t produce the profits it once had, even with 5G introduced. However, as 5G is introduced and the company continues to cut back, Sierra should see some serious gains in the near future. Another company set to make some serious gains with 5G is Telus (TSX:T)(NYSE:TU). In fact, most telecommunications companies are set to soar because of 5G, as it’s incredibly likely each client will have to upgrade their services to keep up. With 5G, everything will be so fast that data usage will soar, making it unlikely someone will want to have anything less than a 10 GB data plan. The reason Telus should benefit in the extreme is because it is the most focused on its wireless sector, rather than trying to also","Sep 6, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/09/06/3-stocks-poised-to-soar-with-incoming-5g/

""Oracle of Omaha"" underscores the importance of business predictability Buffett, a protege of the legendary Benjamin Graham, celebrated his 89th birthday last Friday. The ""Oracle of Omaha"" and Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio), co-managers of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, detailed four investing criteria for good companies at fair prices: understandable business, predictable earnings, economic moat and reasonable price. GuruFocus established a ""business predictability rank"" that captures the strength and consistency of a company's revenue and earnings growth over the past 10 years. Companies that have shown strong and consistent revenue and earnings growth earn ranks of four stars or higher; such companies are defined as predictable companies.

5,Synergy Group Corp plans to pick up 49% stake in Jet Airways; final date for bids extended till Aug 31,Synergy Group Corp plans to pick up 49% stake in Jet Airways; final date for bids extended till Aug 31.," After Jet Airways received a late expression of interest (EoI) from South American conglomerate Synergy Group Corp last week, the airline on Tuesday postponed its final date for initial bids submission for the second time. The deadline is now August 31, and the airline's resolution professional (RP) Ashish Chhawchharia now has three EoIs in hand, including Panama-based Avantulo Group and a Russian fund Treasury RA Creator. Synergy Group Corp, which owns a majority stake in Avianca Airlines, the second-largest airline in Latin America, is planning to pick up 49 per cent stake in Jet Airways, The Business Standard reported. As per government norms, a foreign carrier can neither hold over 49 per cent in a domestic airline, nor effectively control it. ""We intend to structure the acquisition as a foreign company. Jet Airways is publicly listed and we hope lenders would be willing to convert their debt into equity. We will also discuss partnerships with Indian infrastructure companies,"" Antonio Guizzetti, president of consultancy G&A, which is advising the Synergy Group regarding the stake buy, told the daily. He added they have several options. German Efromovich, the Group's Bolivian-born founder, will visit India next month to discuss investment options with Jet Airways' lenders and domestic InfraCos. ""The amount of investment by the Synergy Group will depend on discussions and negotiations with banks and other creditors. In insolvency cases, it is common to negotiate for discount on debt,"" said Guizzetti. Meanwhile, the grounded airline's liabilities continue to mount. As per earlier claims, Jet Airways had liabilities of over Rs 26,000 crore, which has now reportedly shot up to Rs 30,558 crore. Of the total claims, the RP has admitted Rs 12,555 crore worth of claims. Given that Efromovich himself is mired in financial troubles - his wholly-owned carrier Avianca Brasil was grounded by Brazil's civil aviation regulator in May following the company's filing for bankruptcy late last year and around the same time he was ousted from the chairman's post of Avianca - doubts are raised about his interest in Jet Airways. Efromovich is now waging a legal battle to retain control of his majority stake in Avianca after defaulting on a $456 million loan from US airline United Airlines, which the businessman had secured with his Avianca shares. Guizzetti, however, claims that the Synergy Group boasts the funds to bid for Jet Airways, adding that a business plan is being","Sep 5, 2019",https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/aviation/synergy-group-corp-eyes-49-pc-stake-in-jet-airways/story/375994.html

WestJet Airlines Ltd. was fined $17,500, Air Canada was fined $12,500, and Air Transat and Porter Airlines were fined $7,500 for breaching federal regulations. Doled out by the Canadian Transportation Agency last week, the fines are the first under the country's new passenger bill of rights, which came into effect July 15. The rules state airlines must display a notice at the check-in desk, self-service kiosks and departure gate that passengers who are denied boarding or whose luggage is lost or damaged may be entitled to compensation. The regulator says airlines failed to alert travellers to their rights ahead of several flights out of Halifax, Quebec City, Calgary and Edmonton between July 22 and Aug. 7. Ottawa brought in the new rules to beef up compensation for passengers subjected to delayed flights and damaged luggage. They have been met with blowback from industry -- which is challenging the regulations in court -- as well as consumer advocates, who say they leave loopholes for airlines to sidestep penalties.

Photo: courtesy of Pele-Hallam Young Six years ago, my life was fairly normal. I taught full-time at a high school. Most of my colleagues had similar interests and values. They shared teaching strategies and how to help kids. Most of them, politically, leaned to the left. Other jobs attract more right-leaning folk. That became apparent when I quit teaching and began to give investment presentations. Right wing capitalism has a lot of fans. People packed auditoriums to hear me speak about making money. But these people weren’t drawn to my handsome face or my colorful jokes. Instead, they came for the topic. They wanted to increase their wealth. I’ve spoken at several international companies. After I speak, corporate executives often invite me out for dinner. They often want to talk about money. But after each string of talks, I flee to my own Bohemia. For most of the past two years, my wife and I have lived in a camper van in Mexico and Central America. When I’m invited to give a series of investment talks, we store the van and pray that it’s still there when we return. So far, we haven’t been disappointed. Our goal was to drive to Argentina (after shipping our van around the Darién Gap). But civil skirmishes erupted in Nicaragua last year, just as we approached Nicaragua’s northern border. We turned our van around and drove back to Mexico. Throughout Mexico and Central America, we met plenty of people who would cringe if they knew I give investment talks, so I almost never bring that up. Some are American. Others are Canadian, European or South American. Many of them also create paltry carbon footprints. For example, most of them shun material consumption. Many of them use solar power for their day-to-day energy needs. Most of them don’t buy plastic toys for their kids, unless they’re second-hand. They wouldn’t buy a new car, a new phone or a new RV… even if they had the money. Copper Canyon, Mexico, January 2019

Pursuits. ,"    Sep 5, 2019  Chris Chamberlin, Bloomberg News (Bloomberg) -- Originally published by Executive Traveller. Private invitation-only airport lounges behind unmarked doors, the lofty privileges and perks that come with “Very VIP status” — welcome to the world of the high-flying elite. That roster includes politicians and unelected power-brokers, A-list celebrities and the upper ranks of the largest companies. They probably don’t travel anywhere near as much as a top-tier frequent flyer, but who needs a platinum airline membership card when yours is a coveted and rarely-seen black one? Here’s a rundown of some of the world's most exclusive airline clubs and elite status tiers. Chairman’s Lounge (Qantas) Described by Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce as “probably the most exclusive club in the country,” Australia’s Qantas Chairman’s Lounge isn’t just a “secret” frequent flyer tier: it’s also a network of private, invitation-only airport lounges. Located in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Adelaide and Perth, guests enjoy restaurant-style dining and an all-day bar while taking in the serenity of the generally quiet space, or enjoying the artwork, which is rotated every fortnight to give regular visitors something new to look at. Members also receive the highest priority when requesting upgrades, and have their preferences tracked and remembered from flight to flight, such as their usual drink and favorite seat. Qantas has never published a list of Chairman’s Lounge members, but this VIP card is typically held by the CEO and chair of major companies which have sizable travel contracts with the airline, and by other invited guests who work in fields such as politics, show business and media. Qantas arch-rival Virgin Australia sought to emulate the Chairman's Lounge with its equivalent VIP tier, The Club. It offers similar benefits across a network of five private lounges, with the add-on of escorts from lounge to aircraft, (at least) eight free business-class upgrades every 24 months, and complimentary airport limousine transfers when taking cross-country or long international flights. Diamond Plus and Diamond Invitation (Cathay Pacific) Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific has not one, but two secret tiers beyond the lofty heights of Marco Polo Club Diamond: Diamond Plus, which recognizes the airline’s highest-spending flyers, and Diamond Invitation, for the VVIP set. Take the same benefits as “regular” Marco Polo Club Diamond — access to Cathay Pacific and Oneworld first-class lounges, for example — and stir in perks in like an airport",19 hours ago,http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-hidden-world-of-invitation-only-airline-clubs-1.1311978

By: Ben Brown | Email | Leave a comment The Dow Jones Industrial Average is set to open 250 points on Thursday after China and the US scheduled new trade talks for October. But don’t be fooled, the inflated stock market is a bubble, according to Michael Burry. Burry, portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie The Big Short, famously predicted the housing bubble and subsequent recession in 2008. His biggest concern right now is passive investing in index funds, like Dow Jones exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Speaking to Bloomberg, Burry didn’t offer a timeline for the collapse but warned: “Like most bubbles, the longer it goes on, the worse the crash will be.” At 8.31 am ET, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) futures jumped 244 points pointing to a strong open on Wall Street. The move higher was mirrored by S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq Composite futures.  The early rise was triggered by news that China and the US will sit down in October to hash out the next round of trade negotiations. China’s Ministry of Commerce confirmed that talks were ongoing with a view to meeting in Washington DC in early October. Despite the spirited rally in stocks this week, Michael Burry sees a different outcome. He said the true valuation of the stock market is completely distorted by the trillions of dollars flowing through index funds. A total of 50 percent of stock allocations are now in passive funds.

Last Updated at September 6, 2019 23:30 IST Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal was on Friday questioned here by the Enforcement Directorate in a case of alleged contravention of the foreign exchange law, officials said. This is the first time that the central agency is grilling him after it conducted searches against him last month. Goyal's statement has been recorded under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) at the agency's zonal office here, they said. A dozen premises, including Goyal's Mumbai residence in Mumbai, his group companies, their directors and offices of Jet Airways, were searched by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on August 23. According to agency sources, the businessman's empire had 19 privately-held companies, five of which were registered abroad. The agency is probing charges that these firms allegedly carried out ""doubtful"" transactions under the guise of selling, distribution and operating expenses. The ED suspects that expenses at these companies were allegedly booked at fake and high costs and as a result, they ""projected"" huge losses. Alleged shady aircraft lease transactions with non-existent offshore entities are also under the ED scanner and it is suspected that Jet Airways made payments for lease rental to ""ghost firms"", which purportedly routed the ill-gotten money in Goyal's companies. Officials said while the case, at present, is being investigated under the civil proceedings of the FEMA law, additional evidences may lead to the registration of a case against the businessman and others under the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Goyal, along with his wife, were barred from flying out to a foreign location from the Mumbai airport in May as part of the vigil mounted against him by probe agencies. A particular company under the ED scanner is the Isle of Man-based Tail Winds Corporation and it is suspected that it controlled all activities of Jet Airways. The company (Tail Winds) was formed by Goyal in 1992.

After all, few Americans owned stock and prices reflected expectations about future earnings—expectations that weren’t always accurate or that were clouded by short-term emotions. But the stock market today may reflect the economy more than it did 20 years ago. More Americans than ever are invested in the stock market. Just 30 years ago only about 30% of Americans owned any form of stock—now more than 50% do. Your membership supports a team of global Quartz journalists reporting on the forces shaping our world.

15,No truce at IndiGo: Rakesh Gangwal shoots off fresh letter to Sebi - The Financial Express,No truce at IndiGo: Rakesh Gangwal shoots off fresh letter to Sebi. Gangwal’s main grouse regarding the board expansion to,"The fight between Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal, the co-promoters of InterGlobe Aviation which runs low-cost carrier IndiGo, refuses to die, even though the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) on August 27 sailed through peacefully with all resolutions passed by majority of shareholders. At the AGM, Bhatia had exuded hope for truce ahead saying, “I hope Gangwal’s actions will speak louder than his words”. However, all such hopes got belied when on Wednesday news surfaced that Gangwal has fired yet another missive to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on August 30 — just three days after the AGM.
Gangwal’s fresh letter to Sebi basically is reiteration of his demand for removal of controlling rights exercised by Bhatia-controlled InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) on the airline’s functioning.
Sebi has sought a response from the carrier on it. On its part, InterGlobe Aviation said it will respond to the letter. “The August 30 letter reiterates certain issues that Gangwal had previously raised with the Sebi (disclosures in respect of which have been made previously) and seeks certain directions from the Sebi against the company and the IGE Group,” InterGlobe Aviation said in a stock exchange filing. Gangwal, through his counsel at Khaitan & Co, is seeking regulatory intervention on past related-party transactions (RPT), non-independence of current chairman M Damodaran, refusal to hold the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) and public statements by IndiGo chief executive officer Ronojoy Dutta on the dispute. At the August 27 AGM, Gangwal had voted in favour of board expansion which included more independent directors — one of his key demands. He supported the proposed resolutions following redressal of his apprehension to plug certain loopholes in the new RPT policy, which may have been misused by the IGE group in future. The spat between the two promoters became public on July 8 when Gangwal had levelled allegations of corporate governance lapses against Bhatia and the IGE group in a communication to the Sebi.  Gangwal, who holds a 37.02% stake in IndiGo, had questioned the execution of RPTs, rejection of his EGM requisition, misleading of shareholders by the CEO and overarching control of the IGE group in the airline’s management. The group controls 37.92% shares in the company. Besides having the rights to appoint five of the ten directors, the IGE group can appoint key management personnel including the chairman, MD, president and CEO.
