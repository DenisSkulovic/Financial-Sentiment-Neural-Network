0,Why Southwest Airlines Stock Dropped 12% in May | The Motley Fool,Why Southwest Airlines Stock Dropped 12% in May. The 737 MAX grounding is pressuring the bottom line.. What happened. So,"   Shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) lost 12.2% last month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Despite the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, which caused more than 10,000 flight cancellations in the first quarter, Southwest reported its best revenue growth rate in 18 consecutive quarters toward the end of April. But the encouraging performance on the top line wasn't enough to offset concerns about the near-term impact on profitability stemming from the grounding of the 737 MAX. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In early May, one analyst downgraded Boeing stock citing a survey that revealed that many passengers may avoid flying on the 737 MAX for at least a year. Within the last year, there have been two crashes involving the MAX caused by a software glitch in the plane's flight control system. The analyst report, on top of other negative news surrounding the trade war with China and Mexico, sent airline stocks down for the month.  Southwest reported record operating revenue in the first quarter of $5.1 billion, but management said flight cancellations took their toll on operating costs. In the short term, the company expects the MAX groundings to drive unit cost pressure until the aircraft is approved for flying again.  One way or another, Southwest will get back to normal performance at some point. Management said if it hadn't been for the flight cancellations, the first quarter would have been a ""blowout."" Southwest generated $945 million of free cash flow and returned $678 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  The last five years have been a good run for the airline industry, especially for the leader Southwest, which has seen its net profit margin roughly double. Southwest is focused on continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet and implement cost-saving initiatives to keep margins improving. Management is also focused on growth with the new service to Hawaii, which commenced in March.  Even with the flight cancellations, analysts currently expect Southwest to grow revenue and earnings by 5.1% and 6.6%, respectively, in 2019.   John Ballard owns shares of Southwest Airlines.

1,Here's all you need to know about investing in small cap aviation stocks - Stockhead,Here’s all you need to know about investing in small cap aviation stocks. SHARE. Regional Express (ASX: REX). Alliance Aviation," Tech June 7, 2019 | Nick Sundich  The aviation industry is one of the most unique industries. It has very high capital costs, operates frenetically from day to day and it is difficult to to make profits in. But Australia’s market is unique. While Europe and America have several carriers and competing transport options, Australia relies on aviation for tourism, business travellers and FIFO. But if you thought large caps Qantas (ASX: QAN) and Virgin Australia (ASX: VAH) were the only aviation stocks, think again. There are two aviation small cap stocks: Alliance Aviation (ASX: AVQ) and Regional Express (ASX: REX). In some respects they are similar to their larger peers and most other airlines globally. But in other, key respects, they are different. Here is what you need to know.   Regional Express flies various short-haul routes across Australia with a fleet of 55 Saab turbo-prop aircraft. It flies to smaller destinations that lack facilities for larger aircraft such as Cooma in New South Wales, Ceduna in South Australia and Tasmania’s King Island. In addition to passenger aircraft, REX bid for tenders last year to provide fast jet support for the Australian Defence Force and the Victorian Police. While Rex is a minnow compared to Qantas, it is also profitable, recording a $15.8 million profit last year. Alliance Aviation offer charter flights, mainly FIFO as well as wet leasing, usually for Virgin Australia in Queensland through a 41-member fleet of Fokker aircraft. It serves a mixture of destinations from capital cities to towns too small for 737s. Despite the deal with Virgin, Qantas bought a 20 per cent stake in the company back in February. In the long term Qantas intends to gain majority control of the airline; yet for now it’s keeping quiet. Alliance is up 45 per cent in the last 12 months and has made an $18 million profit after tax, two years running.   There are three major concerns from a financial stand point – fuel prices, passenger yields and maintenance costs. Fuel prices are determined by oil prices and these fluctuate heavily on various factors from the global economy to OPEC’s latest production targets. Since October crude oil prices have been low but there is always the chance they could rise again. Foreign exchange rates are critical too because fuel is bought in US dollars. To protect themselves, airlines engage","Jun 7, 2019",https://stockhead.com.au/tech/heres-all-you-need-to-know-about-investing-in-small-cap-aviation-stocks/
2,This is exactly how many days ahead you should buy a plane ticket - MarketWatch,MarketWatch Site Logo A link that brings you back to the homepage. .mwA1{fill:#ffffff;} .mwA2{fill:#4db74d;}. Upgrade. This is exactly how many,"Rethink how you buy airfare. As we dive into summer, airfares tend to rise. And that makes it even more important that you’re smart about booking your flights. Unfortunately, many of us fall for some pervasive flight-booking myths. Here are four. Myth 1: The earlier you book your flight, the better the deals. A CheapAir study released in March, which analyzed more than 917 million airfares in 8,000 markets, reveals that there’s a smart, and not so smart, time to book airfare. “On average, the cheapest ticket is available 76 days before departure. Travelers beware though: getting the best fare is not that simple,” the report reveals. Of course, that’s simply an average and plenty of deals will be had before and after 76 days. Instead, CheapAir.com finds that it’s more helpful to think of booking within windows of time. Book too early and you pay more: 203 to 315 days in advance and you’ll pay an average of $50 more (though you will maximize seat choices); 116 to 202 days in advance and you’ll pay $20 extra. The best booking window for deals is 20 to 115 days in advance. Book later than that and you’ll pay a lot, sometimes up to an average of $220 more. When booking, don’t just default to getting a round trip fare with the same airline. “Switch it up,” says Gabe Saglie, an anchor and producer at travel site Travelzoo. “The airline that gives you the rock bottom fare to get there may not be the one offering the best flight bargain back, so compare round-trip flights with one-way flights on different carriers.” Not sure if your flight’s a deal? Consider relying on Google GOOG, -0.97%   GOOGL, -0.82%  , which recently unveiled a wider release of its new “price insights” tool that helps you figure out if your flight is a deal or not. In a blog post this month, Google notes that: “Once you decide on a destination and start looking for flights, you’ll now see a price insight for most trips — a feature previously only available for holiday dates last year — that shows you whether the prices you’re seeing for flights are high, typical or low compared to what you’d usually find. When we know, we’ll also tell you if the price won’t get any lower or if it’s expected to increase soon so you can","Jun 7, 2019",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stop-falling-for-these-4-traps-when-booking-flights-2019-03-12
3,5 Contrarian Dividend Stocks to Buy With the Market Fully Valued – 24/7 Wall St.,. . . . . 5 Contrarian Dividend Stocks to Buy With the Market Fully Valued. American Airlines. Citigroup. Exxon.,"Depending on which financial pundit you listen to, the market is either fully valued or very close to it, especially if you factor in rate cuts that are looking ever more likely. Only there is one big problem: The Federal Reserve waited way too long to raise rates this cycle, and with federal funds at what is still a historically very low 2.5%, they don’t have near the dry powder that they had back in 2008 when the mortgage disaster almost took the entire financial system down with it. So the question for investors is what to do now? One thing looks pretty obvious. The FAANG stocks, which have driven market gains for the past five years, are very vulnerable, as the politicians in Washington are not happy with the use of consumer data, privacy issues censoring debate and a host of other reasons. Continued trade and tariff issues not only weigh on sentiment but also are bound to increase prices. We decided to look at some contrarian ideas that both make sense now and pay solid dividends. In the Merrill Lynch research database we found five stocks that are rated Buy but have been beaten down and offer perhaps a degree of safety in a very expensive and tired stock market. This company has its major hub in Dallas, where business continues to boom. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) is the holding company for American Airlines. Together with wholly owned and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle and US Airways Express, the airlines operate an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to 350 destinations in over 50 countries from its hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Investors receive a 1.32% dividend. Merrill has a price target of $38, while the Wall Street consensus target is $42.22. Shares closed Thursday at $30.38.

What does the future","Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card! Let's talk about the popular Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Delta Air Lines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Delta Air Lines The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 15% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Delta Air Lines today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $64.48, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Delta Air Lines’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Delta Air Lines’s earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 27%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in DAL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the","Jun 7, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-dal/delta-air-lines/news/when-should-you-buy-delta-air-lines-inc-nysedal-2

However, one hedge fund legend warns that if Donald Trump fails to mount a successful reelection campaign, his successor could trigger a brutal 40% stock market crash. Wall Street’s major indices sped toward blockbuster gains on Friday, building on a volatile pre-market session. As of 1:23 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had leaped an astounding 277.81 points or 1.08%; the DJIA last traded at 25,998.47. The S&P 500 rose 33.51 points or 1.18% to 2,877. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, added 130.19 points or 1.71% to reach 7,745.74 to round out a bullish day on Wall Street. Stock prices boomed on Friday, even after the Labor Department released its much-anticipated May jobs report, which, though not an outright disaster, did little to quell lingering recession fears. Here’s the good news: The unemployment rate held steady at 3.6% – a five-decade low. But here’s the bad news: Non-farm payrolls rose by just 75,000 jobs in May, missing the consensus estimate of 177,000 by a staggering 58% margin. Even worse, the Labor Department revised the March and April NFP figures down by a combined 75,000 jobs.

As of June 2005, Google was valued at about $52 billion, and the second sale of Google shares on August 18, 2005 doubled Google’s cash stockpile to $7 billion. Last year, Alphabet’s sales and net income were over $90.2 billion and $19.4 billion, respectively, compared to sales and net income at $968.1 million and $105.6 million in 2003. Google’s controversial stock split in 2014 (prior to Facebook’s IPO announcement) transpired because the company wanted to create a new class of non-voting shares. In the 2-for-1 split, shareholders received an additional non-voting share for every share of Google stock owned. Google’s announcement was timed strategically largely because of Facebook’s IPO; it was a way for Google to assure investors of their reign in the world of tech stocks. “Over time, our emerging high-usage products will likely generate significant new revenue streams for Google as well as for our partners, just as search does today.” Larry Page’s dreams are elephantine; that’s why he upcycled Google into Alphabet, Inc.

13,Don’t probe us for what Naresh Goyal did: Etihad throws new challenge in Jet Airways revival - The Financial Express,Don’t probe us for what Naresh Goyal did: Etihad throws new challenge in Jet Airways revival. Etihad has posed the,"Efforts to revive Jet Airways have apparently suffered another setback with Gulf carrier Etihad posing a new list of demands to be met by the authorities before it agrees to rescue the beleaguered airline. Etihad has posed the demands before the consortium of lenders led by SBI to infuse funds in Jet Airways, ET Now reported. “There are two-three things going on. Firstly, Etihad wants indemnification from inquiries and investigations which are going against Jet Airway founder Naresh Goyal,” the report said citing sources. Further, Etihad needs a confirmation from the airport authorities and the aviation watchdog DGCA that Jet Airways will get its slots back once the Gulf airline puts in the money. Etihad plans to start 45-50 aircraft after Jet Airways gets on track. Etihad has also asked operational creditors to bear 60-70% haircut. The lenders are yet to respond to Etihad regarding the demands and it is expected that the lenders will wrap up the bidding process by 10 June 2019.  Earlier, DGCA had allotted the Jet Airways slots to various rival airlines including IndiGo, SpiceJet, Vistara among others. DGCA had then said that the slots are given temporarily for three months and Jet Airways will get the slots back upon its revival. Out of over 700 Jet Airways slots, the DGCA had allotted a little less than 450 slots to other domestic airlines. SpiceJet had received most of these slots. SpiceJet co-founder Ajay Singh had previously said that the Jet Airways shut down should be “a wake-up call” to the aviation industry. He also said that policymakers should be partly blamed for the Jet Airways grounding as the cost structure is high. Also, internal factors and high competition also resulted in the Naresh Goyal founded airline, Ajay Singh said at the CAPA Aviation Summit. Jet Airways had finally announced shutdown on 17 April 2019 after it struggled to stay afloat for several months. Meanwhile, rival airlines made the most out of the opportunity and expanded their operations to fill the void created in the domestic market.

15,How Budget Airlines in Asia Will Rule the Skies | InvestAsian,How Budget Airlines in Asia Will Rule the Skies. How are Asia’s Budget Airlines Different?. 1. AirAsia. 2. Vietjet. 3.,"by Reid Kirchenbauer | Blog Last updated June 8th, 2019.   Low-cost airlines have revolutionized the global air travel industry, bringing an end to the days of exorbitant prices and limited travel options. As the slogan of the world’s best budget airline says, AirAsia, “Now everyone can fly”. It appears like that slogan is true since affordable air travel is finally available to the masses in developing Asia. Before we explore how budget airlines will dominate their market, a short explanation of what exactly low cost carriers are (and what made them popular throughout Asia) is essential.   The main concept differentiating a low-cost model from other airline companies is a reduction of services, and therefore prices. Low-cost airlines give precisely that. Such businesses realize that most passengers just want to fly from one place to another with no special amenities. That doesn’t mean low-cost airlines do not offer the same services their competitors do. They merely don’t include anything except a seat on the airplane if you pay the basic, default price. For example, if the passenger wants a meal, they can order it at a surcharge. A few airlines like AirAsia have gone as far as making the luggage fee optional. Its default fare provides only 7kg (15 pounds) worth of carry-on. This concept is proven to be sound, as evidenced by the popularity and dominance of low-cost carriers across the world. More than half of all airline seats sold in Southeast Asia are on a low-cost carrier. Listed below are three of the region’s low-cost airline success stories.   The biggest low-cost airline in Southeast Asia, Malaysia’s AirAsia saw quarterly profit increase over 600% since the start of this decade. Meanwhile, its sales jumped by nearly a third. AirAsia is looking to leverage high growth in China’s aviation market to empower itself even further.   VietJet is one of the fastest growing low-cost carriers in Asia, owning a 40% share of Vietnam’s  total domestic market after just 10 years of operation. It seeks to become a top low-cost airline by adding more than 100 planes to its fleet before the end of 2019.   Singapore’s Scoot made itself known as one of few low-cost airlines that operates medium and long haul flights with a widebody fleet. This diverges from a more traditional low-cost strategy of using small planes traveling short distances.","Jun 8, 2019",https://www.investasian.com/2017/04/23/budget-airlines-asia/
