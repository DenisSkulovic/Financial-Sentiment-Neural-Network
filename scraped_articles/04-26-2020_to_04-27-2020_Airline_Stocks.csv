0,Will Cruise Line Stocks Bounce Back Before Airline Stocks? | The Motley Fool,Will Cruise Line Stocks Bounce Back Before Airline Stocks?. Nearly all cruise line and airline stocks have shed at least,"   The travel industry is taking a beating these days. Between stay-at-home orders and tight travel restrictions investors aren't interested in cruise lines or airlines, and it shows. Cruise line operators have been the hardest hit. Shares of Carnival (NYSE:CCL) (NYSE:CUK), Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL), and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NASDAQ:NCLH) have plummeted between 73% and 81% this year. Airline stocks are holding up better, but the victory is only relative. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta (NYSE:DAL), and United (NASDAQ:UAL) have descended 61% to 71% in 2020. Perennial favorite Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is off 45%, a brutal year for its shareholders but the only ones in this lot that haven't seen their investment cut by more than half. Both industries have been battered, but let's see if cruise lines have a better chance of bouncing back. IMAGE SOURCE: ROYAL CARIBBEAN. Things seem pretty bad for the airlines these days. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly is bracing employees for potential furloughs, something that hasn't happened in the airline's 49-year history. Kelly argues that if things don't improve in the next three months, Southwest may have to become a smaller airline. Passenger loads are down more than 95% across the industry, and the airlines are scaling back on their scheduled flights. As bad as a 95% reduction in passengers may seem, the cruise industry has it worse. Cruises haven't had a bon voyage for more than a month, and they keep pushing out a return to sailing. Both industries are bleeding money right now, and only the airlines have been recipients of U.S. government bailouts. The news got even better for them over the weekend with the U.S. Treasury Department releasing an additional $9.5 billion in funds from the Payroll Support Program for the airlines. Though cruise lines haven't been as fortunate with bailouts given that they are registered in overseas markets with kinder taxation requirements, there is some hope overseas. Reports over the weekend had Germany's export credit agency providing a 12-month debt holiday providing nine figures in additional liquidity for at least Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line. Carnival and its two smaller peers have already raised billions on their own in recent weeks to make it through the next few dry months.  It may not seem like a fair fight. Airlines have access to U.S. bailout initiatives, and folks have the choice somewhat to fly.

2,"Warren Buffett may have ditched airline stocks and spent $20 billion on stock buybacks, investor Chris Bloomstran says | Markets Insider",". Warren Buffett may have ditched airline stocks and spent $20 billion on stock buybacks, investor Chris Bloomstran says. Parachuting","   AP Images  Warren Buffett has been silent as stock markets roil and oil prices plunge, fueling speculation about what he's up to. The famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway boss may have ditched airlines and plowed more than $20 billion into stock buybacks, but probably hasn't bought many other stocks or struck any big bailout deals, according to a fund manager and Berkshire shareholder of more than two decades. Chris Bloomstran, head of Semper Augustus Investments, dedicated more than 50 pages to Berkshire analysis in his latest letter to clients. SAI held about $60 million worth of Berkshire stock at last count, making it the fund's biggest holding. He spoke to Business Insider by telephone and email at the end of last week.  Berkshire owned between 8% and 11% of the ""big four"" airlines — American, Delta, United, and Southwest — at the end of December. It sold $390 million worth of Delta and Southwest stock a few weeks ago, and that may have been just the start. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see the investments in the airlines either gone or greatly eliminated,"" Bloomstran said. As governments across the globe continue to restrict travel, and millions of people stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, demand for air travel has plummeted. Delta's passenger numbers have plunged 95%, forcing it to slash its flights by 85%. The result is that airlines face a deeply uncertain future, even after accepting billions in grants and loans from the US Treasury. In exchange, the government demanded warrants allowing it to purchase the airlines' shares at a discount in the future — a strategy inspired by Buffett's bailouts during the financial crisis. ""It's hard to tell how long it will take for capacity utilization to recover sufficiently, and if the virus compels restrictions on travel beyond another couple months, the airlines will require more liquidity to avoid restructurings,"" Bloomstran said. ""Even Berkshire doesn't have those answers.""

3,Why Millennials Are Wrong About Investing in AAL Stock | InvestorPlace,Why Millennials Are Wrong About American Airlines. The “experience” generation is ignoring the fundamentals of AAL stock. The Leaders of," As the calendar gets ready to turn to May, talk of a staged reopening of the U.S. economy is gaining momentum. However, American Airlines (NYSE:AAL), along with all airlines, remains grounded. And that means AAL stock is lying on its back as well. Like all airline stocks, AAL took a steep drop in February. However, the stock rebounded a bit on news that the airline industry would receive bailout funds from the federal government’s CARES Act. That bump was short lived. The stock has fallen over 30% since March 26. But that begs the question, is AAL stock too cheap to ignore? My InvestorPlace colleague Larry Ramer made a case for buying shares as the warmer weather approaches. And Nicolas Chahine offered the technical argument. That message seems to be resonating with at least some investors. According to Robinhood, American Airlines was the sixth-most-bought stock on the app in the last month. This isn’t surprising. Robinhood is popular among millennial investors. But is this an example of investors buying on the news? Or could millennial investors be signaling their vision of a post-coronavirus economy? As recently as mid-March, millennials were still taking to the air. Despite the announcement that the novel coronavirus was being characterized as a pandemic, millennials saw it as an opportunity to travel at cheap prices. Millennials are the leaders of what is being termed the “experience economy.” As real estate agents continue to lament, this is a generation that is placing a higher value on experiences over things like homes. A 2016 survey by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) emphasized that millennials will pay more for travel, entertainment and dining compared to their parents and grandparents. And a Travelport survey shows that millennials take more vacation days on average, 35, than any other generation. They also are more willing to spend on a vacation. It’s impossible to know for certain how individual consumers will respond once they are given the opportunity to fly. But it’s worth noting that demand hasn’t waned because of the economy, but rather by executive order. We can’t speculate on what demand may have been. But assuming that millennials don’t want to lose their investment dollars, we may be able to speculate on what’s to come. Millennial investors may be signaling their intention to get back on airplanes as soon as possible.

5,3 Reasons Warren Buffett Won’t Buy Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . 3 Reasons Warren Buffett Won’t Buy Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock. Reason #1:,"      Andrew Button | April 27, 2020 | More on: AC In the past month, there has been speculation that Warren Buffett could take a position in Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock. The “Oracle of Omaha” is well known for his love of airlines, buying up their shares in large quantities over the past decade. Air Canada is not only an airline stock, but one that looks like a bargain, with a (trailing) P/E ratio of just 3.4. That would seem to make it a potential Buffett play. However, it’s quite unlikely that Warren Buffett will buy Air Canada shares. Buffett’s recent moves indicate a souring on airline stocks, which wouldn’t suggest a desire to scoop up AC on the dip. In this article I’ll be exploring the three main clues that Buffett won’t be buying Air Canada any time soon. For a while now, market watchers have noted that Buffett behaved differently in the March market crash than in previous crashes. In the past, Buffett was a voice of calm in bear markets, encouraging investors to buy the dip and putting his money where his mouth was. This time, he’s playing things very differently. Charlie Munger recently said in an interview that Buffett isn’t looking to buy beaten down stocks on the cheap. Noting that Berkshire is “focused on liquidity,” he said Buffett is playing it extremely safe. “Playing it safe” usually doesn’t mean buying cash-strapped, nearly shut-down companies. So if Munger’s comments are accurate, they’d indicate that Buffett isn’t interested in Air Canada. Recently, Buffett made waves by selling about $300 million worth of Delta Airlines stock. Prior to this, he had bought $45 million worth on the dip. DAL shares declined in value between the two purchases, so Buffett exited part of his DAL position at a loss. Having recently trimmed the airline exposure in his portfolio, Buffett probably isn’t looking to buy more. While Buffett still holds his favourite airlines, their proportion of his portfolio has decreased. That doesn’t bode well for those hoping Buffett will give AC shares a vote of confidence. A final clue that Buffett won’t be buying AC is the fact that his portfolio already has a lot of airlines. Some people have taken this as a signal that Buffett could buy AC, but in fact, it might be the opposite.

6,TFSA Investors: Should You Buy Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . TFSA Investors: Should You Buy Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock?. Air Canada stock,"      Haris Anwar | April 27, 2020 | More on: AC A seismic shift is underway in the global airline industry after the COVID-19 pandemic, which grounded the majority of planes and forced airlines to seek government bailouts.  According to industry experts, a long shakeup lies ahead that is set to touch almost every aspect of flying after governments relax travel bans and people are ready to travel again. “We should be prepared for a choppy, sluggish recovery even after the virus is contained,” Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said in a letter to employees this week. “I estimate the recovery period could take two to three years.” In this uncertain situation, investing in airline stocks such as Air Canada (TSX:AC) will be an extremely risky bet. But if you’re a young investor with a TFSA limit to invest, picking Air Canada stock could be a very profitable bet over the long run in the next, say, five years. Air Canada, which was the best-performing airline stock until mid-January, has suspended most international flights until June due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That means more than 160 Air Canada routes are suspended, as closed borders and vanishing travel demand continue to ravage the airline industry.  But I can’t imagine a situation where we stop visiting all the beautiful places in the world or permanently shun countries and cities where our friends and family members live. At some point — hopefully in the next year or so — the world will have a cure for this virus, and things will start turning back to normal.  Billionaire Bill Gates, who is funding production of the seven most promising ideas for a vaccine, says the one could be ready in the next 12 months. “If everything went perfectly, we’d be in scale manufacturing within a year,” Gates said on CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS. “It could be as long as two years.” If we have that sort of time frame in our mind, then this is the right time for TFSA investors to start buying Air Canada stock, which is close to its rock-bottom level. Trading at $18.24, it has fallen more than 60% this year. After hitting a $9.26 low on March 18, it has more than doubled. With a potential economic recovery starting late this year, one other factor that should help Air Canada","Apr 27, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/27/tfsa-investors-should-you-buy-air-canada-tsxac-stock/
7,Airlines get selective boost from coronavirus bailouts | Reuters,Airlines get selective boost from coronavirus bailouts. . . . . . . . . . . . ,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Laurence Frost 5 MIN READ PARIS (Reuters) - Progress towards coronavirus bailouts buoyed the shares of Lufthansa LHAG.DE and Air France-KLM AIRF.PA on Monday, as the protracted travel slump turned up the heat on rivals yet to secure financing needed to tide them through the pandemic. Lufthansa shares rose as Germany moved towards a multi-billion-euro rescue for its national airline champion, while investors digested a 7 billion euro ($7.6 billion) state-backed package unveiled for Air France-KLM late on Friday. But the coronavirus crisis risks drawing an uneven state aid response from governments, creating divisions between the haves and have-nots. Virgin Atlantic is seeking private investors after its appeal for about 500 million pounds ($620 million) in UK aid met a lukewarm initial reaction. Norwegian Air NWC.OL said it would run out of cash in weeks unless creditors and shareholders approve a rescue that all but wipes out its current owners. “European and Asian governments will undoubtedly provide immediate financial support to the troubled airline industry through 2020,” sector analyst Howard Wheeldon said. “From an airline perspective the COVID-19 crisis is not only ground-breaking for all but for some, terminal.” Germany will not allow Lufthansa to be among the casualties, two ministers said on Monday. “We want large and important companies that play a role in the world market to remain competitive after the crisis,” economy minister Peter Altmaier told public radio. Lufthansa shares were up 7.6% in Frankfurt, while Air France-KLM’s stock was 1.7% higher as of 1343 GMT - the gains dampened by the prospect of dilution in a capital increase. Announcing the Air France-KLM loans, with another 2 billion-4 billion euros to follow from the Dutch government, the Franco-Dutch group said it expected to raise new equity within the next year, with France likely to participate. “The fear of such an impending raise will also act as a cap on the shares going forward,” Citi analyst Mark Manduca said. As risks go, dilution is still preferable to bankruptcy. Norwegian Air shareholders are being asked to approve their own near-obliteration in a rescue that leaves them with just 5% of the airline - handing 53% to leasing firms and 42% to bondholders. Its shares fell further after the plans were outlined on Monday. The carrier, which went from low-cost long-haul disruptor to the brink of insolvency even before the virus outbreak, may still struggle to","Apr 27, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-airlines-markets-idUSKCN2290WE

Tezcan Gecgil, PhD | Monday, 27th April, 2020 | More on: CCL EZJ In 2020, investing in FTSE 100 travel and airline stocks has meant capital loss for shareholders. Today I’m taking a look at the share prices of cruise operator Carnival (LSE: CCL) and International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE: IAG) (the owner of British Airways and Iberia) to see how £1,000 invested in each would have fared over the past five years.  Year-to-date (YTD), the stocks are down about 76% and 64% respectively, which means the shares are clearly in bear market territory.  5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Under each company name below, you can see how the price has changed over the past five years and what this change equates to in terms of the compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Then, I’ve shown how £1,000 would have fared over five years. Past share prices are for late April 2015. Current ones are closing prices on 24 April. I haven’t factored-in any brokerage commissions or taxes. Please note that until recently, both FTSE 100 firms paid regular dividends. The calculation below doesn’t take into consideration the dividends or reinvesting that income. Given the uncertainty the industry is facing, in late March Carnival axed its dividend. Then in April, IAG took a similar step. CFO Stephen Gunning said the board was withdrawing the proposal to pay a final dividend of €0.17 per share. The share price has fallen from 3,008p to 849.20p, although on 2 January 2020, CCL shares were around 3,648p. It means CAGR of -22.35% so £1,000 would have decreased to about £282. On 2 April, Carnival stock price hit a 52-week low of 581p. It was indeed an all-time low for the shares.

VOLATILITY.," Air Canada (TSX:AC) has been investors’ top travel stock choice — on this side of the border at least — and it’s easy to see why. The logic behind an Air Canada investment is simple. Travel will eventually recover, likely faster than all the naysayers predict. All it needs to do is survive this crisis and it’ll be fine. Most folks predict there’s no way the government will let our nation’s largest airline declare bankruptcy, so they’re bullish. But I’m not sure the thesis will play out that smoothly. Remember, Air Canada has already gone bankrupt, and there could be advantages to going through the process again. The company does have more than $3 billion in net debt, after all. There’s also no guarantee a bailout would be good for common shareholders. Government assistance is designed to help keep jobs, not backstop investors. Besides, I think there’s another Canadian travel stock investors should consider, a company that might even offer more upside potential than Air Canada. Let’s check it out. Investors shouldn’t just be checking out airline stocks. Hotels are similarly beaten up, and are facing many of the same challenges. The hotel industry is much more fragmented than the airline business. Even big brands don’t typically operate their own hotels; they franchise the business to scores of different entrepreneurs. This makes a wholesale bailout of the hotel business impossible. Thankfully, the industry doesn’t necessarily need it. Most hotels remain open, although occupancy is quite weak. But hotels have been able to lay off staff and take other measures to cut costs. Additionally, lenders are being smart by giving the industry a pass on paying back mortgages for the foreseeable future. All of this translates into good news for American Hotel Income Properties REIT (TSX:HOT.UN), which is probably my favorite travel stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange today. American Hotel Properties owns 79 different hotels in so-called secondary cities, places like Pittsburgh, Tampa, and Baltimore. While these cities may not be tourist meccas, they get steady traffic from business travelers. Additionally, most hotels are on major transport routes, which also helps occupancy.

10,Investing in airlines | Bring your investments to new heights - Finder UK,. . . . . . . . . Investing in airlines. Is investing in airlines on your radar right,"Updated Apr 27, 2020 BEST FOR All-rounder BEST FOR Low-cost trading BEST FOR US shares BEST FOR Beginners The global airline industry has been one of the sectors most affected by the coronavirus pandemic, with flights to and from some countries grounded completely. Various carriers have halted up to 80% of their flights, and many are offering customers the opportunity to postpone their bookings until later in the year. Unsurprisingly, share prices in airlines have been tumbling since the beginning of the year. Analysts are split on when the markets will ultimately hit bottom, but some investors are seeing these falls as an opportunity to snap up stock. Perhaps the most obvious way to invest in this sector is to buy shares in individual airlines (or their parent companies). When buying stocks, investors traditionally look at the current financial results of a company, whether they are paying any dividends to shareholders, and what the firm’s future stock market performance might be. But with airlines, other factors to consider include passenger numbers, the proportion of flights they are operating where all the seats have been sold, and the cost of fuel – one of the big expenses for airlines. In these unpredictable times, the balance sheet for most carriers is not necessarily going to be looking too healthy. And with passenger numbers at historic lows, metrics around traveller numbers could be hard to gauge. So while share prices may look attractively cheap, one of the most important considerations will be whether the airline you are considering investing in is in a strong enough position to weather the current coronavirus storm. Would-be investors would not want to purchase bargain shares in an airline that could potentially fold later this year as a result of the pandemic. Compare brokers to buy airline stocks ETFs – or exchange traded funds – are another investment option worth considering. In simple terms, ETFs are funds which own and “track” a variety of assets, including stocks in various companies. Buying into an ETF means you do not have to purchase individual shares in different companies yourself. More general information on this type of fund can be found in Finder’s guide to ETFs. Currently, the US Global Jets ETF (known as JETS) is the only ETF that exclusively tracks airlines stocks. But other larger funds, and ones which focus on the transport sector for example, will also include","Apr 27, 2020",https://www.finder.com/uk/investing-in-airlines

Getting started.,"Stock markets have taken a battering as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic continues to rattle global economies. But some young people are taking it as an opportunity to kick-start their investing careers.  Online stock trading platforms have seen a surge in demand in recent months as investors seek to take advantage of undervalued equities. Investing app Robinhood saw “record” deposits in the first quarter of 2020, with daily trades up 300% compared to late-2019. Elsewhere, eToro and Raging Bull Trading saw demand surge 220% and 158%, respectively, over the same period. Even as the severity of the outbreak and its implications for markets began to unfold in March, another online platform Wealthsimple Trade recorded a 54% surge in new users and a 43% uptick in total trades. So far in April, the trading site has added new users at a weekly rate of 7,000. Many of those new users are young or even first-time investors. Over half (55%) of Wealthsimple’s new users are aged 34 or below. That is unsurprising, according to Raging Bull Trading’s founder, Jeff Bishop, who said many millennials are now looking for new opportunities to make some extra cash — or recover earlier losses. “A lot of people are at home and have got more time on their hands. And many, unfortunately, have lost their jobs and are looking for new opportunities,” Bishop told CNBC Make It. “Younger investors are looking for ways to recoup their money,” he continued. “They’re really interested in low, beat-up stocks.” The advent of online investment platforms has made it easier than ever for people to buy stocks in individual companies. That can be a risky business. Generally, financial advisors recommend opting for diversified vehicles, such as passively-managed index funds or ETFs, which provide access to a full range of stocks. “Investors should always factor in balancing their investments between different regions, sectors and asset classes,” noted Joel Carpenter, divisional director of marketing at St James’ Place Wealth Management.  However, the shock nature of the current downturn — which has wiped out the market value of many companies — has some suggesting that now could be a good time to get a foothold in otherwise strong companies. “Typically, when you see a decline like this one, the expected return of stocks goes up,” Ben Reeves, chief investment officer at Wealthsimple told CNBC Make It. “We’re seeing dramatic swings in the","Apr 27, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/28/investing-advice-millennials-are-stock-trading-to-beat-the-downturn.html

27TH APR, 20. Is Berkshire buying stocks?. What was Berkshire doing before the sell","    Get investment ideas from Patrick Poke when you sign up to Livewire Markets.     During the Global Financial Crisis, Warren Buffett made headlines with some huge investments in high quality but distressed companies, including Mars, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Dow Chemical. But so far, it’s been radio silence from the Oracle of Omaha, with an absence of any significant deals to be announced thus far, despite their US$128b cash pile. So what is Buffett up to? The upcoming Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Meeting in Omaha (this year, devoid of any actual shareholders, bar Buffett and Munger themselves) will no doubt shed some more light on his thinking, but for now, what can we learn about Berkshire’s actions from other sources? US regulations require hedge funds or institutions that manage more than US$100m to file a quarterly “13F” report, which tells us about significant changes in their investments. Sadly, these are only required to be filed 45 days after the end of the quarter, so the information can be quite dated by the time its released. Regardless, it’s interest to see what adjustments were being made in the months before COVID-19 took off. Please note that some of these trades may have been instigated by one of Buffett’s lieutenants, not Buffett himself. Phillips 66 – Sold 95.6% An American energy company that was spun out of ConocoPhillips. This was a relatively small position by Berkshire’s standards, representing a mere half a billion dollars worth of stock. The Travelers Companies – Sold 94.8% Another relatively small (approx. US$800m) position that was almost completely exited. Despite the name, this company is not in the travel industry. It’s actually a property casualty insurance company based out of New York. Goldman Sachs – Sold 34.6% This was a pretty important sale to note. Berkshire’s position in Goldman was a big one, representing nearly US$3B before these sales. The stock sold represents around US$1.4B. A trade this large would almost certainly have been handled by Buffett himself. Wells Fargo – Sold 14.6% While the percentage of the overall holding sold here was smaller than with Goldmans, the dollar value of the trade was significantly larger. Berkshire’s holding in Wells Fargo was worth nearly US$20B before this sale, with it being reduced by around US$3B by this big trade. Again, a trade this size likely has Buffett’s personal","Apr 27, 2020",https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/is-berkshire-buying-stocks

Finder might not concur and takes no responsibility. Historical closes compared with the close of $34.16 on 2020-10-16 Valuing United Airlines stock is incredibly difficult, and any metric has to be viewed as part of a bigger picture of United Airlines's overall performance. However, analysts commonly use some key metrics to help gauge the value of a stock. United Airlines's current share price divided by its per-share earnings (EPS) over a 12-month period gives a ""trailing price/earnings ratio"" of roughly 10x. In other words, United Airlines shares trade at around 10x recent earnings. That's relatively low compared to, say, the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the NASDAQ 100 at the end of 2019 (27.29). The low P/E ratio could mean that investors are pessimistic about the outlook for the shares or simply that they're under-valued.
