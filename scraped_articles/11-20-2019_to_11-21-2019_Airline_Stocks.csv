0,Airline Stocks Swing With the Price of Oil. That Isn’t Efficient. | Barron's,Airline Stocks Are Swinging With the Short-Term Price of Oil. That Isn’t Efficient.. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. This Week's Magazine. Airlines don’t,"  This weekly email offers a full list of stories and other features in this week's magazine. Saturday mornings ET.  Airline shares were dragging down industrial indexes Wednesday morning. The reason? Apparently, investors forgot that short-term oil price
swings don’t matter
. The change in stock values seem to belie the idea that markets are efficient.   Shares of American Airlines (ticker: AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) were all down more than 1% near midday. Wall Street didn’t publish a splashy research note
. One broker did launch coverage of Alaska Air with the equivalent of a Hold rating. That shouldn’t be enough to tank the sector.  The sector is down because it was up on Tuesday, when gains were fueled by benchmark crude prices that fell more than 3%. Jet fuel is a huge expense and the price is tightly correlated with oil prices. But oil was back up on Wednesday, so airline shares were moving in the other direction. Still, over two days airline shares are down about 1.3% on average. Oil prices are down over two days, as well, by about 1.5%. The lockstep move is counterintuitive. When costs are falling, stocks should be rising. Investors can’t blame the overall market. The S&P 500 is off just 0.1% over the same span. What’s more, over long periods, airline stocks aren’t tightly correlated
with energy prices. That may surprise investors. The absolute level of energy prices is less important to airline stocks than the rate of change in energy prices and the relative hedging positions of rival airlines.  Airlines don’t like oil-price volatility. That makes it hard to price tickets. Airlines are also unhappy when a peer has low-cost hedges in place, creating a competitive-pricing issue. In the end, airlines as an industry have lost billions with $20 per barrel oil and made billions with $80 oil. The two-day reaction in airline shares looks like an overreaction. The market is supposed to be efficient. But, of course, traders exist to arbitrage value discrepancies
. And stock prices move every day. Still, it is a curious move.  At the margin, of course, lower oil prices help airlines. Lower costs mean airlines can drop fares, boosting demand for air travel. What’s more, U.S. consumers don’t have to spend as much money on gasoline when oil prices are low.","Nov 20, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-stocks-oil-jet-fuel-volatility-arbitrage-american-delta-51574269668

2,"Macy's is about to report earnings, but traders have mixed thoughts",The worst-performing S&P 500 stock is about to report earnings. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"Macy’s may not be the best stocking stuffer this holiday season. The retailer, which is down nearly 80% from its 2015 peak, is set to report earnings Thursday morning. TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon says that retail carnage is likely to continue based on technical retracements. “The rule that we use if you’re looking at these retracements ... basically if you break the 78%, roughly three-quarters, if you don’t hold that, the rule says you should retest the lows, and that’s at $5,” Gordon said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”  Based on his technical analysis, when Macy’s broke below that three-quarters retracement of its 2015 highs at roughly $20, that set it on a course back down to $5. Macy’s would fall another 67% from its current price above $15 before reaching that level. The department store chain’s stock dropped over 10% on Tuesday after retailer Kohl’s sour earnings report. Kohl’s fell nearly 19% on Tuesday leading the XRT retail ETF to its worst day of the month. Looking at the technicals, Gordon doesn’t see much hope for beaten-down Macy’s but recommends a few other names with stronger qualities. “I think we’re going to lows [in Macy’s]. There’s plenty of strong names in retail — Costco, Target — if you’re looking for clothing retailers. I would say a no-touch here in Macy’s,” said Gordon. Quint Tatro, president of Joule Financial, isn’t counting the retailer out and is hoping on a turnaround for the worst performing S&P 500 stock. “Personally, I added some shares today. The stock is interesting here. I am not normally a bottom-fish trader. I don’t try to catch falling safes, but the stock is trading like it’s going out of business,” Tatro said during the same segment. Tatro points to Macy’s fundamentals and says investors would assume the company couldn’t cover their dividend. “In reality, they’re set to earn around $2.50 next year, with $1.50 in dividends, so that’s covered. Debt to equity of 0.75, it’s not atrocious. And it’s got a current book value of around $20. So, the stock looked like it was bottoming,” Tatro said. Tatro said he won’t add any more to his portfolio until he sees a dramatic turnaround in earnings growth and fundamentals. “Ultimately, from a technical perspective, it’s got to break back above $17,” he said.

3,"If You Invested $500 in Boeing's IPO, This Is How Much Money You'd Have Now | The Motley Fool","If You Invested $500 in Boeing's IPO, This Is How Much Money You'd Have Now. Buy-and-hold investors who got into","   Boeing (NYSE:BA) is one of the pioneering names in aviation, and the company in recent years has been one of the top-performing stocks among industrial companies. Boeing shares have gained more than 145% over the past three years, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 44% gain, and the shares are up more than 600% over the past 10 years. Investors who bought in 2009 are undoubtedly pleased with their investment. But how much could you have made if you bought in during Boeing's initial public offering? Boeing began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 2, 1962, according to data provided by the company's investor relations department. The shares traded for $0.8230 apiece that day, so $500 would have bought about 607.5 shares. The company completed eight stock splits between 1966 and 1997, and paid a dividend at the end of every quarter since listing on the exchange. SHARES OF BOEING HAVE SOARED OVER THE YEARS. IMAGE SOURCE: BOEING. Presuming you reinvested those dividends and accounting for the splits, the adjusted price on the first day of trading was $0.1466 and you would now own more than 3,400 Boeing shares. Based on Boeing's $371.68 share price at close of business on Nov. 15, that original $500 investment would now be worth more than $1.268 million. That's a compound annual growth rate of more than 14%. Boeing has had its share of ups and downs during that time, building products that helped launch the golden age of commercial aviation, powered NASA into space, and helped the Pentagon win wars, but also experiencing setbacks including a failed supersonic to rival the Concorde and, more recently, issues with the 737 MAX. But an investor who held steady through the highs and lows would have done quite well, a reminder of Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner's advice to hold steady because over time, winners win. It's probably not a surprise that Boeing's history dates to well before its public listing, but many don't know how much of the modern U.S. aviation industry was once tied together under the Boeing name. William E. Boeing, a Seattle-area timber exec with an interest in flying, started Pacific Aero Products Co. in 1916, renaming it Boeing Airplane Co. a year later. The company's first product, the Model C, was used by the U.S. Navy in the later stages of World War I.

4,Best Stock and Investing Advice for 2020 From the Experts | Fortune,A roundtable of investing experts share their best advice for 2020. Fortune's panelists see great opportunities for 2020. But they,"Economists may be fretting about a 2020 recession; not so the panelists on our annual roundtable of investors. (Even the self-described “bear in the room” was fairly upbeat.) But our experts also characterized 2019—a year in which virtually every asset class registered big gains—as a weirdo anomaly. Next year, they say, investors will need to be pickier. Our panel was wary about the future of Big Tech stocks, and bullish about smaller tech, as well as health care—with or without Medicare for All.  This year’s panel included Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy and head of global ESG research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch; Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management; Karina Funk, comanager with David Powell of the top-performing Brown Advisory Large-Cap Sustainable Growth investment strategy; Rob Sharps, head of investments and group chief investment officer at T. Rowe Price; and Angela Strange, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. Here are edited excerpts from their discussion. Fortune: We’re going on 11 years of a bull market in the U.S., but many investors have spent the past couple of years wondering when the other shoe is going to drop. We’ve had slowing GDP growth, we’ve had declining corporate earnings. Are we staring at something worse, like a recession?  Josh Brown: I’m going to start by correcting you. We’re in a secular bull market that began in 2013. That’s the first time we made a new high since the 2007 crash, and that’s important because we don’t measure the 1982 to 2000 bull run from the lows of 1974.  There’s also the cyclical bull that’s making new highs as we speak. In December 2018, we were down 20% in the S&P 500. So this is not quite as long of a bull as you might suspect if you just look at the starting point and the end point. [Pause] I’ll leave now, if you want. No, please stay for the remaining 40 minutes! [Laughter] But you raise a good point: Is anybody here feeling defensive right now for reasons other than the age of the bull? Savita Subramanian: Not to be the bear in the room, but there is this risk that a lot of the earnings we’ve seen over the last 10 years have been manufactured, by companies either buying back shares to pump up their EPS growth, or cost cutting.

5,Virgin America - Wikipedia,Virgin America. Contents. History[edit]. Founding (2004–2007)[edit]. Virgin Group operations (2007–2016)[edit]. Alaska Airlines merger (2016–2018)[edit]. Corporate affairs[edit]. Business trends[edit]. Offices[edit]. Destinations[edit].," Virgin America Inc. was an American airline that operated between 2007 and 2018, when it was integrated into Alaska Airlines. The airline primarily focused on operating low-fare service between cities on the West Coast and other major metropolitan areas, with higher quality service. It was headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Burlingame, and operated domestic flights to major U.S. cities, primarily from hubs at San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as a smaller focus city operation at Love Field in Dallas. The airline began operations in 2007 as an independent airline using branding licensed from the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, which also controls the brand of the Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia airlines. The Alaska Air Group acquired Virgin America in April 2016, at a cost of approximately $4 billion and continued to operate Virgin America under its own name and brand until the airline was fully merged into Alaska Airlines on April 24, 2018. In early 2004, Virgin Group announced its intention to found a United States-based, low-fare airline called ""Virgin USA"". At the time, Virgin USA expected flights to begin by mid-2005. After considering several key areas, the San Francisco Bay Area was chosen as the location of its flight operations center and later as its corporate headquarters.[3] The airline changed its name from ""Virgin USA"" to ""Virgin America"" and due to the difficulty in finding U.S. investors willing to gamble on a new airline in an already congested industry, the launch date was pushed back from mid-2005 to early 2006.[4] Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005.[5] Once the new owners were on board, Virgin's General Counsel submitted the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005.[6] Unfortunately, despite significant public support for the new California-based airline, the approval process was mired in a debate between the supportive city and state representatives from California and New York and the opposing national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as a potential competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.[7] In order to achieve the necessary approval, Virgin America's","Nov 20, 2019",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_America

But there’s more where that came from, says David Burrows of Barometer Capital Management, who thinks investing in Canada’s largest airline is less risky than you might think. After a year of being stuck in the clouds in 2018, Air Canada has been flying high this year, almost doubling in value since the start of 2019. The airline began the year with lots of optimism after spending years upgrading its fleet of planes and expanding its reach with additional domestic and international routes, a $12-billion investment, according to management, which is now paying off.

Now, history is rewarding the believers as AC looks ready to break through the $50.00 per share mark. The best part of this scenario?

U.S. President Donald Trump has signed a bill calling for the delisting of foreign companies that don't adhere to the same accounting transparency standards that securities regulators impose on public U.S. firms.Why It Matters: The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act takes aim at Chinese companies and drew rare strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress before arriving on Trump's desk.The act says delisting could happen if a given company doesn't comply with audit inspections three years in a row.China's government does not allow the board to perform audit inspections of Chinese companies listed in the US. Audit inspections are performed on other U.S.-listed companies by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, set up after accounting scandals such as the one that blew up Enron in the early 2000s.Chinese companies listed in the U.S. have been embroiled in financial scandals in the past -- including Luckin Coffee Inc - ADR (OTC: LKNCY) this year, which led to a Nasdaq delisting.Sixteen Chinese companies have delisted since February 2019, according to a government report in October.Carson Block, who has made himself a short-selling star through his investigations into Chinese companies, has called for the delisting of Chinese firms, saying to Bloomberg last month: ""This is China and the Chinese stock promotion, manipulation fraud machine laughing in the face of the SEC.""What's Next: Markets now await any news on specific delistings. The bill could affect 217 Chinese companies, including popular stocks such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR (NYSE: BABA), JD.Com Inc (NASDAQ: JD), Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE: NIO), Xpeng Inc - ADR (NYSE: XPEV) and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ: LI).But because of the three-year compliance timeline in the act, delistings may not be imminent.The author of this article holds shares in Luckin Coffee and an inverse ETF that tracks the downward performance of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong.Photo credit: Xpeng Motor Technology Ltd.See more from Benzinga * Click here for options trades from Benzinga * Klarna Could Follow Affirm Holdings","Nov 20, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-analysts-saying-ahead-thursdays-182853181.html

shares are down 4.5% in the past week, but at least one larger option trader is betting on more downside from the chip maker ahead of its third-quarter earnings report. On Wednesday morning, Benzinga Pro subscribers received two option alerts related to unusually large Analog Devices trades. Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader. We sift through this volatile market for consistent trades so you don't have to. Get Benzinga Options: Starter Edition to follow Benzinga's high-conviction options trades.  Click here to get my trades! Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock. Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there’s no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively modest sizes of Wednesday’s Analog Devices option trades by institutional standards, they are unlikely to be institutional hedging. With Analog Devices earnings due out on Nov. 26, the strike price of the puts purchased on Wednesday suggests more than 2% additional earnings downside given the highest break-even price of the puts is $107.20.  Analog Devices traders may also be getting bearish on the stock’s longer-term outlook given a recent deterioration in trade war negotiations. Management cited “uncertainty in the trade tensions between America and China” as one of the factors contributing to a lack of clarity in its guidance. Investors may be cautious about going all-in on Analog Devices given the ongoing near-term uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the trade war in China. The silver lining in Wednesday’s option market trading is that the smaller, bullish January 2020 put sales suggests at least some traders see longer-term downside for Analog Devices as limited. Given the broad semiconductor market hasn’t shown much improvement, Analog Devices investors likely need big growth numbers next week in 5G devices and electric vehicles to exceed market earnings expectations. The stock traded around $108.81 per share at time of publication. Do you agree with this take? Email feedback@benzinga.com with your thoughts.

17,The Intrinsic Value of Southwest Airlines - The Investor's Podcast Network,. RESOURCES ASSET ALLOCATION VIDEO SERIES. EPISODE 2: THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. LESSON SUMMARY. LESSON TRANSCRIPT. MEMBERS AREA," In this second lesson of the Asset Allocation Course, we’re step-by-step going through the process of valuing a specific stock. We’re using an interesting example, which is Southwest Airlines. Hey guys, welcome to my second lesson in my Asset Allocation Course. For this lesson, I would like to talk about the valuation of Southwest Airlines. Now, please keep in mind that the process that we’re going through here is a general approach.We could talk about Coca-Cola, Nike, or basically any other company that you can think of. This is more the process of how to look at individual stocks because what we saw in the earlier video, in lesson 1, was that if the American stock market is priced at 3% or 3.5%, we can get a higher return, or we can hope to get a higher return on individual stock picking. But how do you estimate the expected return of a stock? So that’s basically what we’ll go through, and we’ll go through some of the different factors that you can look into when analyzing a stock so it’s easy for you to compare it to a bond or any kind of investment that you might also be looking at. The first thing that I’d like to say is that we always need to relate something to the price of a stock. Let’s talk about the airline industry. The airline industry has, for a good reason, been hated by value investors for decades. When I say good reasons, it is definitely good reasons. You can count the number of bankrupt Airlines to be in the hundreds easily.
