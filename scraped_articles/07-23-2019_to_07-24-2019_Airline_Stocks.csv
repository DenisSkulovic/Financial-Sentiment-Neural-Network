LUV Trades from $1      The airline industry got off to an optimistic start in second-quarter 2019 earnings season with Delta Air Lines DAL and United Airlines Holdings UAL posting encouraging earnings numbers earlier in the month. Both carriers delivered better-than-expected results. Moreover, the top and the bottom line of the companies improved year over year. Strong passenger revenues on the back of upbeat travel demand and lower fuel costs (as fuel expenses comprise a major chunk of airline expenditures) aided the quarterly results. In fact, banking on solid travel demand, the carriers also provided bullish earnings per share projection for the current year. Delta now expects full-year earnings per share between $6.75 and $7.25 (earlier view: $6-$7 per share).

4,"A pullback is creating a big buying opportunity, bull Tony Dwyer says","Market bull Tony Dwyer sees an unsettling pullback forming, but he urges investors to buy it. MORE IN TRADING NATION.","One of Wall Street's long-time bulls believes a potentially stomach-churning pullback is unfolding in the market reminiscent of the mayhem of May. Canaccord Genuity's Tony Dwyer blames too much enthusiasm surrounding all-time highs and overbought conditions. But don't fear. He contends a pullback will create a solid buying opportunity. ""It's kind of like it was at the end of April. On April 30, we made the same kind of call,"" the firm's chief market strategist told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Monday. ""Nobody expected that, and all of the sudden you got a 6.5% or so decline from peak. We think it'll be a little bit less than that. But just similar setup."" The S&P 500 sharply rebounded from the May sell-off in June. Weeks later, the index was rallying to new highs. This time, Dwyer speculates the pullback began last Tuesday, a day after the S&P 500 hit its all-time high of 3,017. The index is off 1% since then. Based on his calculations, the S&P has another 4% or so to fall. ""Even though you're within 1% of an all-time high in the market, only 36% of stocks are above their 10-day moving average,"" Dwyer said. ""And, you've seen some of my intermediate-term indicators roll over."" His year-end S&P 500 target of 2,950 implies stocks won't muster a second-half rally. However, his 2020 year-end target of 3,350 shows a more than 12% gain from current levels. In a note this week, he said his fundamental core thesis remains positive because of an easy Federal Reserve, low inflation, positive economic growth and valuation expansion. ""Rather than chase the tape, I'd rather buy it on a little bit of a dip,"" said Dwyer, who's advising investors to target offensive groups including industrials, financials, consumer discretionary, technology and communication services.

5,Apple may hit a 2019 high when it reports—here's the earnings strategy,Apple could hit a new 2019 high when it reports next week—here’s the earnings strategy. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News,"If you’re sweet on Apple, now might be the time for a bullish trade. Things are starting to look up for the iPhone maker, which reports earnings on July 30. From its reported deal talks with Intel and its suppliers beginning to post strong earnings results, Apple has been on the rise — and, if you ask TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon, that climb could continue. “I like the technical position of Apple here, and also how earnings have been received here early on in the earnings season,” Gordon said, adding that the stock could push above a downtrend going back to 2018 if the results are positive.  The options market is also factoring in Apple’s spikes that closely followed the last two earnings reports, Gordon said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” It predicted a high probability of Apple — which closed around $209 a share on Tuesday — staying between $198 and $218.57 after the release. “I think we play the upside,” said Gordon, suggesting a “call butterfly” trade. In effect, the person putting on that trade would buy one call, sell two, then buy another with a goal of rising to the middle strike. “The expected move is $218.57; we’re lined up around that 217.50 for the middle strike,” Gordon said. That $217.50 level would represent a new 2019 high for Apple, if the stock were to reach it. The entire trade cost about 76 cents, with a maximum potential loss of $77 if Apple breaks below the lower barrier or rises above the $222.50 level. “If we were to get that expected move, that’s where the profit starts to come in. You could potentially make $420,” the technical analyst said. “So, this is a nice, defined-risk way to play earnings on the upside using a technical break through resistance.” However, investors interested in this trade need to know that if it doesn’t work out, they won’t be able to navigate out of it, Gordon said. “Remember, this is a trade that’s meant to take advantage of earnings, so you can’t manage it if the trade doesn’t work,” he said. “Position-size according to what works for your specific portfolio or trading account and you should be fine.” Apple gained less than 1% in Tuesday’s trading session. It was down slight in Wednesday’s premarket, trading at $208. The stock is up over 32% this year.

6,JetBlue Airways Corporation Earnings: Profit Flies Higher | The Motley Fool,JetBlue Airways Corporation Earnings: Profit Flies Higher. The popular low-fare airline returned to strong earnings growth last quarter as its,"   JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) posted a string of incredible earnings results following the rollout of its Mint premium transcontinental service in 2014. More recently, the popular low-fare carrier fell into a bit of a rut, with slowing revenue growth and rising costs combining to pinch profits. As a result, adjusted pre-tax income -- which peaked at $1.2 billion in 2016 -- receded to just $654 million last year. However, JetBlue is beginning to turn things around. A multiyear cost-cutting program is finally paying dividends, while unit revenue growth is starting to improve. Slightly lower fuel prices are helping, too. This allowed JetBlue to report stellar earnings growth in the second quarter -- and management expects similarly strong growth in the third quarter. Metric Q2 2019 Q2 2018 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $2.11 billion $1.93 billion 9.2% Total unit revenue 13.14 cents 12.74 cents 3.1% Cost per available seat mile excluding fuel 8.46 cents 8.32 cents 1.8% Adjusted pre-tax margin 11.3% 8.1% N/A Adjusted net income $180 million $119 million 51% Adjusted EPS $0.60 $0.37 62% DATA SOURCE: JETBLUE AIRWAYS Q2 EARNINGS RELEASE. CHART BY AUTHOR. The main highlight of the second quarter was that JetBlue firmed up its long-haul expansion plans. In April, JetBlue announced that it would convert 13 Airbus (OTC:EADSY) A321neo orders to the A321LR variant, which can fly hundreds of miles further. The carrier said it would use these planes to begin flying nonstop from Boston and New York to London in 2021, confirming what everyone in the industry had long suspected. In June, JetBlue went even further by agreeing to convert another 13 A321neo orders to the new A321XLR model that Airbus launched at this year's Paris Air Show. The Airbus A321XLR will have enough range to fly much deeper into continental Europe from the Northeast than the A321LR. It will also be capable of flying from South Florida to all of the major population centers in South America. Airbus will begin delivering the A321XLR in 2023. These moves show that JetBlue sees plenty of room for growth on longer-haul routes. They also signal that the carrier is serious about deepening its competitive advantage in Boston -- where it is already the largest carrier -- by adding service to the top destinations in Europe. JetBlue also continued to make progress on its cost-cutting plan last quarter. It has now locked in annualized savings of $257","Jul 23, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/07/23/jetblue-airways-corporation-earnings-profit-flies.aspx
7,ADM: A Safe Investment in an Expensive Market,SMART INVESTING NEWSLETTER. ADM: A Safe Investment in an Expensive Market. . . . . ,"As the market has continued its climb to new heights, I have often been questioned if this rise  is problematic. By no means do I think the stock market is inexpensive, but that is the reason I recommend finding good quality businesses which trade at good valuations. One business which I have been fond of for many years is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). It is a good, stable company which has recently gone on sale. The current price of $40.54, is more than 20% below its 52-week high of $52.07. The company is an agricultural processor and food ingredient provider. The food ingredients include alcohol, beans, dried fruits, extracts, flours, grains, oils, sweeteners, and many others. The company is also involved in providing supplements, animal nutrition, and fuel to the industrial industry. It is beneficial when a company can use its products and services to supply a variety of different industries, as this reduces the reliance on a particular industry should one group slow down. This well run company is also impressive because it has had consecutive profits for the previous 20 years. I believe this is a credit to management and the safety of the industry in which it operates. With the fall in the stock price, the valuations now look very appealing. The current P/E of 13.9, is well below the industry average of 80.3; Price/Sales of 0.3, compares well to an industry average of 1.2; and Price/Cash Flow of 8.7, is also inexpensive against an industry average of 18.8. Price/Tangible Book value of 1.7, compares to an industry which is not material. I am also impressed with the ratio, trading under 2.0 given the consistent earnings stream. Even with inexpensive valuations, ADM has witnessed some growth. Sales have grown 4.5% over the last 12 months, while EPS has increased 31.4% during the same time frame. Investors in the business receive a nice dividend yield of 3.5% and the company only uses 43% of its earnings to pay it out. This gives me comfort in the sustainability of the dividend payments. The balance sheet for ADM looks very strong given a current ratio of 1.5, which provides plenty of liquidty and a Debt/Equity of just 52%, shows the company does not have too much debt. Looking forward to December 2020, estimated GAAP EPS of $3.57 would give us a target sell price of $58.91.

Dow components Coca-Cola Co and United Technologies Corp both beat second-quarter earnings expectations as the reporting season shifts into high gear.

Formulae display:?. 1. Introduction. 2. Literature evidences. 2.1. Terrorism","   The paper aims to examine the relationship between stock returns and terrorist attacks for the Indian securities market in last 30 years. The stock market returns have been modelled using conditional volatility framework, and there are good enough shreds of evidence to confirm that terrorist activity and cross-border tension has disrupted the investors’ sentiment. The market response to the terrorist attack holds different facets like Target, Location, Number-of-perpetrators, and Property-value has produced a significant impact on the financial market. At the outset, attack day hold an adverse effect on the market and remains unstable till next few days followed by the recent terrorist attack. The results also imply that market participant considers the nature of terrorist attack in their portfolio selection and long-term investment strategy. The practical implications of the study are threefold: (i) investors do regard the terrorist attack in their investment proposal (ii) investors take the short position due to terrorist attack that result into the rise of general stock market volatility and (iii) the financial planning within short-horizon gets postponed followed by the recent terrorist attack. Keywords: JEL CLASSIFICATION: The 9/11 terrorist attack in the U.S.A. manifested as one of the most significant terrorist events in the history of the United States and around the world. The media and politics have paid much attention to the terrorist threat and terrorist activity after 2001. The phenomenon of terrorist events challenged the present security system and functioning of an economic system. The researcher, policymaker, and political system attended to examine the global terrorism and, the literature is booming at a rapid rate in the area of finance, economics and peace studies. The state and non-state driven terrorist activities are increasing at an exponential rate and are the biggest threat to human civilisation and the market economy. The state-owned political conflicts and group ideology plays a significant impact on the market economy. The economist calls this effect ‘fleeting effect’ on the securities market and markets’ fundamental. The September 11 attacks on the U.S.A. and the London Transport Bombings disturbed the functioning of the U.S and the London Stock Exchange to such an extent that it took the markets almost a month to recover completely. The 11/26, Mumbai attack disrupted the human life in Bombay and posed uncertainty in financial markets, and it took at least one week to rebound.

Grant Thornton’s Ashish Chhawchharia was appointed the RP for Jet Airways’ IBC proceedings. The legal counsel of Luckystar alleged that Chhawchharia took possession of the property as if it belonged to the grounded airline. Janak Dwarkadas, senior counsel of Luckystar property, also argued that the Resolution Professional does not possess any right on the property which is not owned by debtor Jet Airways but by someone else, the media reports said.  On RP’s part, it had cited the NCLT order, which granted a moratorium on Jet’s assets after the company was admitted into the insolvency proceedings late in June. Citing law, Dwarkadas added that a property’s possession belongs to a licensor and the licensee has only juridical possession till the time mentioned in any agreement. The Mumbai bench of NCLT has adjourned the matter to August 8.  Naresh Goyal-founded Jet Airways was moved to NCLT after the consortium of lenders led by The State Bank of India dragged the beleaguered airline for insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The lenders also appointed Ashish Chhawchharia as the Resolution Professional as is required under IBC. SBI had said that it was forced to drag the airline to court after it could not find any resolution for the airline even after months of trying.
