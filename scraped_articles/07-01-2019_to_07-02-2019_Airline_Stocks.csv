0,3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in July | The Motley Fool,3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in July. Two banks and one airline from Berkshire Hathaway's holdings look really cheap,"   After 10 years of a strong bull market, it's getting tough to find good deals on quality stocks. You won't find many high-flying tech stocks among Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, which reflects legendary investor Warren Buffett's long practice of avoiding industries he doesn't understand. Two of the industries that fit Buffett's circle of competence and where he has been finding deals lately are banking and airlines. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire owned significant stakes in Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Here's why these stocks might be some of the best bargains in the market right now. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Shares of the world's largest financial institutions have been left out to dry in recent years as investors chase the exciting growth stories in other industries. Valuations for the big banks have become incredibly cheap. Buffett has taken notice. Berkshire holds several bank stocks, including 18,353,635 shares of Goldman Sachs at the end of the first quarter. That's 5% of one of the most prestigious financial institutions in the world.  Goldman Sachs hasn't grown the top line much over the last decade, but it's been consistently profitable, and management is beginning to target new products and services to expand its addressable market. One of those is the effort to get into consumer banking, with Goldman recently partnering with Apple to launch a consumer credit card.  Goldman Sachs has enormous growth opportunities across different areas. The company has less than $50 billion in online retail deposits, but there are trillions worth of deposits in the U.S. that Goldman could tap into to grow its deposit total. A similar opportunity exists in investment management and investment banking.  Given these opportunities, the stock looks like a bargain, trading for 1x tangible book value. What's more, management plans to repurchase nearly 10% of the company's shares outstanding over the next year -- a signal to investors that the stock is undervalued. Plus, a dividend increase to $1.25 per share starting in Q3 of this year was recently approved, bringing the forward yield to 2.4% based on the current stock price. Berkshire's largest bank holding, and second largest equity holding overall, is Bank of America. Berkshire owns $26.3 billion worth of the stock, which is nearly 10% of the total outstanding shares of Bank of America -- a big vote","Jul 2, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/07/02/3-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-in-july.aspx

What About,"Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card! In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) shareholders, since the share price is down 12% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 25%. See our latest analysis for Singapore Airlines While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). During the three years that the share price fell, Singapore Airlines's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 5.8% each year. In comparison the 4.0% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. This suggests that the market retains some optimism around long term earnings stability, despite past EPS declines.  It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Singapore Airlines's earnings, revenue and cash flow. When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Singapore Airlines, it has a TSR of -2.3% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return. While the broader market gained around 7.2% in the last year, Singapore Airlines shareholders lost 6.5% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.

CNBC Newsletters,"The last time the tech sector had a first half this strong, Bill Clinton was still president. The XLK technology ETF has rallied 26% since the beginning of the year, its best January-to-June stretch since 1998. The likes of Microsoft, Advanced Micro, PayPal, MasterCard and Apple have been among those super-charging the gains. One of those stocks is just getting started, according to Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray. “If there is going to be any sort of trade deal, take a look at the chart of AMD,” Johnson said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “This is a stock that has been in a pretty well-defined uptrend. A close above $33.50 on that stock would be a nice topside breakout and see an objective that would take the stock up into the mid-$40s.”  A move to at least $45 marks nearly 50% upside for AMD. It has already surged 65% this year. Not all of the best-performing tech stocks will continue to rally, though, warns Johnson. “On the weaker side, I’d point out the stock of PayPal. This particular stock has been in a very well-defined uptrend, but the most recent advance hasn’t been as strong in the move to the upper end of the channel,” said Johnson. “That one is a pan, and I would be looking to take some profits in PayPal.”  Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, says he’s staying long the growth tech trade even after this strong six-month run. “With the market at highs here, we at Federated have taken a couple chips off the table in terms of our equity overweight, but we’ve done it on the value side and internationally and specifically chosen not to reduce growth,” said Chiavarone. The IVW S&P 500 growth ETF, which holds tech stocks including AMD, Microsoft and Cisco, has added 19% so far this year. Its value equivalent, the IVE S&P 500 value ETF, has increased 15%. “These companies are sitting really at the vanguard of what we’ve talked about a lot, which is a digital revolution,” said Chiavarone. “From AMD to PayPal to Microsoft to Apple to MasterCard, what you see is that they’re all tied to this in some way, whether it be on mobile payments or big data or AI.

4,"Long strangle options trade in American Airlines, seeking higher volatility",. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Options Trader Looking for,"Someone thinks activity is going to get more interesting in the world’s biggest airline. Options activity spiked in American Airlines (AAL) yesterday, with one transaction accounting for more than half the volume. Here’s what happened in a single second during the final hour: Calls fix the price where a stock can be purchased, so they tend to make money when shares rally. Puts are just the opposite, profiting to the downside. Why would someone spend so much money for both? The answer is that he or she probably thinks AAL will start moving more aggressively in either direction. The stock would have to rise or fell more than $2.875 for the position to be profitable. The trader also may expect implied volatility, a key ingredient in options pricing, to increase. The strategy, known as a long strangle, is a common technique to play higher volatility. (See our Knowledge Center for more.) AAL rose 0.83 percent to $32.88 yesterday. It’s gone pretty much nowhere all of 2019 amid worries about fare pressure. However, last month the industry showed signs of a turnaround. Some chart watchers may also see the potential for AAL to start moving if it breaks a downward-sloping trendline that’s held it in check since February. In conclusion, AAL has been pretty boring all year. But now someone is looking for the company to start moving again.","Jul 2, 2019",https://www.tradestation.com/insights/2019/07/02/options-trader-looking-for-volatility-spike-in-key-airline/

8,Viewpoint | Why Do We Buy The Shares Of A Company That Has Gone Broke?,. Viewpoint | Why do we buy the shares of a company that has gone broke?. A combination of the,"                                           I have written about the loss aversion of investors in the past and the tendency of investors to keep averaging the purchase price in the hope of breaking even in a stock. While it can be justified in some instances, what is confounding is the tendency of investors to keep buying known bankrupt companies. There was an airline. The airline stopped flying. The planes were all leased and not owned by the company. Salaries for the staff have not been paid for months. Airport charges, payments to caterers, lease charges, provident fund dues, taxes etc. are unpaid. Bank interest is overdue. Reported losses are more than the net-worth of the company. Landing slots and check-in counters, things of some value, are being allocated by the government to other airlines. What then is the worth of the company or the listed equity shares? Questionable investments The above is a description of Kingfisher Airlines. Long after the airline had ceased operations, the stock continued to trade and found buyers. The airline shut operations in early 2012 and the stock continued to trade on the exchanges till the middle of 2015. The nominal price of the stock may be low. Say a few rupees “only” per share. However it is a certainty that the stock will be worth nothing. No matter how low a purchase price, in a bankrupt company, the loss will be 100 of the purchase price. Kingfisher Airlines is not an isolated example from the past. Global Trust Bank shareholders likewise received nothing when the bank was taken over by the Oriental Bank of Commerce. In the current scenario, where many companies are going into liquidation, the shares of those firms continue to find buyers. It is worth noting the difference between creditors and lenders to a company versus the equity shareholders. Let’s say a company has operations funded by ₹ 50 of equity shareholders’ money and ₹ 50 of lenders’ money. Over the years, the company makes losses such that the accumulated losses amount to ₹ 60. In such a scenario, the funding received by the company from lenders continues to accrue interest and in fact","Jul 1, 2019",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/viewpoint-why-do-we-buy-the-shares-of-a-company-that-has-gone-broke-4154861.html

10,Boeing Stock Has Much Bigger Things to Worry About Than the 737 MAX | Barron's,Boeing Stock Has Much Bigger Things to Worry About Than the 737 MAX. . . . EDITOR'S CHOICE. . Newsletter,"  Boeing stock has managed to gain so far this year, despite a Justice Department probe
and global flying ban
on its 737 MAX jet. That suggests its shares can overcome design and manufacturing issues. But the biggest risk facing Boeing investors will be much harder to control: slowing air traffic growth.   The MAX has been grounded since mid-March, after the second fatal crash involving the model. The Justice Department is looking into manufacturing practices at a site assembling the 787 Dreamliner jet after reports questioned quality practices at the plant. Boeing (ticker: BA) told Barron’s it doesn’t comment on legal matters. While Boeing stock has fallen overall since the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March,
it has still climbed 13% year to date.  Boeing—and its suppliers—have been relatively impervious to the MAX woes because growth in air travel has been strong for a decade. Air traffic growth, however, is slowing as the global economy decelerates. And that may be what hurts Boeing stock more in the future than any of the more dramatic issues facing the company. Read more: The Boeing 737 MAX Delay Drags On. Here’s What That Means for Aerospace.  “After the strong [airline] traffic growth seen in the last two years (about 7% on average), traffic growth in 2019 has moderated,” Vertical Research Partners aerospace analyst Rob Stallard writes in a Monday research note. Slower growth for airlines can turn into demand weakness for aerospace suppliers. “We aren’t altering our stance on aerospace at this point, but this data does make us a little less optimistic on the outlook—and if investors share our view then some of the more exuberant valuations in the aero sector could be called into question,” he added. Aerospace and defense has been a great sector for investors. Industry stocks are up, on average, more than 25% year to date, far better than the 13% return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The sector has risen about 16% on average for the past five years, better than the 10% average annual return of the Dow. Aerospace gains have been justified, driven by a strong industry structure characterized by technical complexity and two dominant producers that split the market. Earnings at aerospace and defense firms have grown at 13% a year on average for the past five years, better than the 6% earnings growth at S&P 500 companies over the same span.","Jul 1, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-stock-bigger-things-to-worry-about-than-737-max-51561995357

12,United Airlines vs. Delta First Class: Which Is Better?,United Airlines vs. Delta First Class: Which Is Better?. . Who Has the Better Stats?. The Drill. Wine and Dine.,"You’re planning a transatlantic flight to Paris. The thought of being crammed into an economy seat for eight hours only to face a rubbery egg served inside a half-frozen English muffin makes you cringe. This time, you’re splurging on first class. You keep frequent flier accounts with both United (UAL) and Delta (DAL) and are not sure which airline to choose. Before you leave the decision up to a coin toss, remember that when it comes to the perks and services provided in first class, airlines can vary wildly – both in quantity and quality. Every year, the Wall Street Journal’s “Middle Seat Scorecard” ranks airlines in seven areas of service and one overall category. In 2018, Delta scored better than United in all seven, including on-time arrivals, baggage handling, and customer complaints, as well as in the overall service category (Delta ranked first overall; United, fifth (tied with JetBlue).1﻿ Regardless of whether you’re flying first-class or economy, you don’t want your bags to wind up in Akron when they’re supposed to meet you in Amsterdam. It might be wise to base your choice on basic operational stats rather than what kind of beer they serve in the first-class lounges, and in that case, Delta is likely a safer bet.  Here’s what you can expect when flying first class with Delta. You’ll be first to board the plane and served complimentary drinks before takeoff. Expect free entertainment; generous snacks (short flights), meals (longer flights), and drinks throughout the flight; reserved overhead luggage space and outlets to plug in your iPhone.2﻿ Keep in mind that Delta’s top-class — Delta One (formerly BusinessElite) — is only available on long-haul international and transcontinental domestic flights.3 On United, you can also expect similar boarding policies and generous availability of refreshments. For in-flight entertainment, the airline features DirecTV offerings (on select flights).4 If legroom is your number one priority, you’ll have to base your decision on another factor since both airlines feature comparable seats with equal amounts of sprawl. Ditto with checked luggage: Both Delta and United allow you to check two free bags to most destinations. Beer aficionados can sip on premium brews on some domestic Delta flights. On flights of 900 miles or more, expect dinner service to feature items such as grilled chicken with risotto or spinach ricotta ravioli.

Air india disinvestment | Divestment or disinvestment Surajeet Das Gupta 
Last Updated at July 2, 2019 11:10 IST State-owned air carrier Air India, which has had little success in enthusing strategic investors so far, might now begin to appear attractive. Why? The reason is simple: Jet Airways, one of Air India’s key competitors among full service carriers (FSCs), in both domestic and international space, has closed operations. The planes of debt-strapped Jet are being taken away by lessors and its lenders are making last-ditch efforts to get a buyer — they are in talks with the Hindujas — before the airline’s case is referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Even if Jet Airways were to revive, it would have to start from the bottom, and building a fleet of the size it had when flying normally (119 planes) would take two to three years. Meanwhile for Air India, that would be enough time for a new investor to restore it to a sound shape. Another reason working in Air India’s favour now is the government’s plan to clean up part of the airline’s burgeoning debt from its books — a major deterrent for investors when it attempted divestment the previous time. A decision has been taken to transfer Rs 29,464 crore of Air India’s working-capital debt not secured by an asset to a new company, Air India Asset Holdings. As a result, Air India will now have a debt burden of only Rs 25,000 crore, mostly long-term debt secured by aircraft purchases. Also, its interest outgo will come down to just around Rs 1,700 crore a year. Thirdly, Jet’s demise has made Air India’s international business look far more attractive to new investors than it did earlier. For instance, the 5-million-per-year passenger market in Europe, which Jet dominated earlier, is now open for Air India, with no other Indian player competing — IndiGo has only just started a flight to Turkey. Similarly, in the 0.95-million-per-year US and North American market, Air India now reigns supreme among Indian carriers, with Jet now out of action.

AirAsia India | Vistara Airlines | Jet Airways crisis BS Web Team 
Last Updated at July 1, 2019 09:29 IST  As Jet Airways undergoes bankrupcty resolution, the Tata Group is looking to bid for the airline's aircraft and bilateral rights to scale up and tap the gap created by the exit of the Naresh-Goyal led airline. The Tata Group has two joint ventures in the aviation space. One is with budget airline AirAsia and the other is its stake in full-service carrier Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines. Both Vistara and AirAsia India, along with their partners, are quietly putting together an aggressive plan to become a formidable force in the skies. AirAsia India plans to double their fleet from 21 to 40 aircraft by April next year and also plans to start international operations to Sri Lanka, Thailand and Malaysia by September 2019. Vistara recently got permission to fly abroad after a delay of over a year due to the investigation in the alleged bribing and lobbying charges against AirAsia India. To back their plans, the Tatas, according to sources, have lined up Rs 4,500 crore for the two airlines. If everything goes to plan, they would be the only player in India to straddle both the low-cost carrier as well as the full-scale service space in the international arena among private players, Business Standard reported earlier. According to a report in Economic Times, Vistara has sought to get more aircraft into its fleet, including those grounded at present. “Acquiring (Jet’s) Boeings makes our otherwise A320 Airbus fleet asymmetric but it will at least service the gap even if temporarily.” Tata SIA Airlines chairman Bhaskar Bhat was quoted as saying by ET.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   (Adds EPA comment, background on oversight of asbestos, paragraphs 3, 9) By Jonathan Stempel July 1 (Reuters) - Ten U.S. states and Washington, D.C. sued the Environmental Protection Agency to begin working on rules to tighten oversight of asbestos, and reduce the health risks that the substance poses to the public. The attorneys general from California and Massachusetts, Xavier Becerra and Maura Healey, said on Monday they are leading the case, after the EPA denied the states' petition that it collect more data on asbestos. A spokesman for the EPA and its administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the agency does not discuss pending litigation. Asbestos is a carcinogen once used widely in fireproofing and insulation. Many companies stopped using it by the mid-1970s after it was linked to mesothelioma and other types of cancer. Federal law still allows limited uses of asbestos, and Congress in 2016 amended the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to create a process for regulating the substance. Symptoms from asbestos exposure can take decades to surface. ""Asbestos is a known carcinogen that kills tens of thousands of people every year, yet the Trump administration is choosing to ignore the very serious health risks it poses,"" Healey, a Democrat, said in a statement. ""There's too much at stake to let the EPA ignore the danger that deadly asbestos poses to our communities, including to workers and children,"" added Becerra, also a Democrat. Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington state joined the lawsuit. The EPA has said protecting people from asbestos exposure is a priority, including through an April rule giving it power to review asbestos products that were no longer on the market before they could be sold again in the United States. In denying the states' petition, the EPA determined that it was already aware of all current uses of asbestos, and had the essential information needed to assess the risks, according to the Federal Register.

18,One Reason to Watch for a VIX Spike This July,One Reason to Watch for a VIX Spike This July. What a rare SPX historical performance signal means for stocks,"GET THE BEST OF THE MARKET.
IN JUST 5 MINUTES.
EVERY SATURDAY MORNING.  Take a look before this sneak preview gets taken down! Video Here! <<<< Sponsored The April-June gains in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) weren't quite as ""runaway"" as those collected in the first calendar quarter of 2019, but the June snapback in the equities market -- which completely erased May's rout -- was sufficient to deliver a second consecutive positive quarter for stocks. What's more, on the heels of its early June bounce from firm support at 2,730, the S&P went on to set new record intraday and closing highs later in the month (edging past the previous peaks set as recently as May 2019 and September-October 2018). While the benchmark U.S. equity index wrapped up the first half of 2019 with a year-to-date gain of 17.3%, Schaeffer's Quantitative Analyst Chris Prybal flagged a notable extreme in six-month S&P returns a few days before the second quarter ""officially"" concluded. As of Wednesday, June 26, the rolling six-month (126-day) return on the S&P hit 23.9%, marking just the 11th time since 2000 that this metric has exceeded the 23% threshold. With six-month S&P returns reaching such rarefied heights, are we due for a nasty mean reversion heading into the third quarter? The short answer is no, not necessarily, based on Prybal's findings -- in fact, the S&P generally tends to outpace its average ""at any time"" returns over the short term after its rolling six-month historical return tops 23%, suggesting that ""strength begets strength"" in this scenario. There's one weak spot at the 10-day mark after a signal, when the S&P's average return arrives at a loss of 0.3% -- considerably undershooting its ""anytime"" average return, a gain of 0.2%. Otherwise, though, the index's returns at our usual post-signal check-in points comfortably surpass its typical returns. At 42 days after a signal, for example, the S&P is up 1.6%, on average, compared to 0.8% anytime. And at 84 days and 126 days out, average returns are 4.7% and 4.5% following a signal, compared to 1.6% and 2.5% at any time since 2000. But it's worth mentioning that when we look at Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) returns following one of these SPX outperformance signals, it seems that volatility spikes have been somewhat likelier than usual to take place over certain short-term time frames.
