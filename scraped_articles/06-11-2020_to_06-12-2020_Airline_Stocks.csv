0,Airline Stocks Are Flying Again. Expect More Turbulence. | Barron's,Airline Stocks Are Flying Again. Expect More Turbulence.. . . BioAtla Is the Latest Biotech IPO to Pop. . .,"    Airline stocks are soaring again after their brutal descent on Thursday. Shares of American Airlines Group (ticker: AAL) were ahead 15%, after the company said in a filing that it’s seeing more signs of improving demand. Other stocks in the sector are flying as well, including United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), both up more than 10%. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, issued a slew of upgrades and downgrades in the sector. Analyst Jose Caiado upgraded Southwest Airlines (LUV) to the equivalent of a Buy and downgraded Spirit Airlines (SAVE) to an Underperform. He gave United a Neutral rating to the stock, down from Outperform. Airline stocks have been exceptionally turbulent as investors try to reconcile conflicting data on the scope and shape of a recovery. The stocks soared a week ago on hopes that summer travel would rebound and signal the start of a broader recovery. The sector then plunged this week on a dire outlook from the International Air Transport Association, and warnings from Delta that it may default on some debt obligations if it couldn’t renegotiate the terms. Caiado waded into the pool on Friday with several ratings changes and new price targets. He assigned an Outperform rating to Southwest and raised his price target from $35 to $45. The upgrade “reflects our view that LUV is not only a good way to invest in the near-term recovery in leisure travel demand, but it is also our favorite multiyear strategic investment with a best-in-class balance sheet that positions LUV to stage an aggressive comeback,” he wrote. One of Southwest’s strengths is its “war chest” balance sheet. The airline has amassed $13 billion in cash and available funding, more than ample for an airline its size. That should enable Southwest to be aggressive in a recovery, adding more planes to its fleet and expanding routes, Caiado said. Southwest plans to retire older planes and upgrade its fleet with Boeing 737 MAX planes, which have yet to be recertified following their grounding by safety regulators. He expects the planes to be cleared for commercial flights by the fourth quarter, giving Southwest a lift. He’s less positive on Spirit, downgrading the stock to an Underperform, though he raised his target from $12 to $13. Spirit’s stock has more than doubled off its lows in March, recently trading around $18, and the valuation now looks too rich","Jun 12, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-stocks-are-flying-southwest-delta-american-coronavirus-51591979058
1,Should You Buy or Sell Airline Stocks Right Now? | The Motley Fool,Should You Buy or Sell Airline Stocks Right Now?. It has been a turbulent year for airline stocks. Is now,"   You can't be blamed if you sold out of airline stocks as the COVID-19 pandemic decimated the industry. After all, one of the greatest names in investing dumped massive airline stakes at a loss during the panic. But investing can be humbling, even for Warren Buffett, and the stocks have been surging of late on growing optimism that the worst of the travel drought is behind us.  AIRLINES DATA BY YCHARTS The stocks have come a long way off their lows, but the recovery is still fragile, and risks remain. Here's a look at where the sector stands, and whether investors should be looking to buy or sell right now. COVID-19 has hit airlines hard, with companies in March seeing more cash flowing out the door in refunds than they were taking in via new bookings. Some of the largest airlines were burning through more than $100 million per day at the peak of losses, a rate no carrier can sustain for long. But the market largely underestimated how healthy the airline sector was heading into the crisis, and its ability to quickly raise fresh liquidity. It's understandable investors would assume the worst: Airlines historically have fared poorly through recessions, with the U.S. industry producing more than 100 bankruptcies since late-1970s deregulation. This time really was different. A round of bankruptcies followed by consolidation a decade ago created a stable, more resilient industry that came into 2020 generating solid profits and with significant unencumbered assets from which to borrow. Since March, U.S. airlines have raised nearly $20 billion in new debt and equity financing, and have a $50 billion backstop from the U.S. government to fall back on. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The money bought the industry time to wait out the pandemic and hope for a recovery, and recent evidence suggests we have bounced off the bottom. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is currently screening airport passengers at numbers not seen since early March, and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) said it was adding back domestic flights because its average number of daily passengers had more than tripled compared to April. Airline shares had fallen to levels that assumed bankruptcies were inevitable, and if a recovery is at hand the industry looks cheap. Even after the rally only one carrier, Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT), trades at more than one time sales, and heavyweights including American and United","Jun 12, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/12/should-you-buy-or-sell-airline-stocks-right-now.aspx

Airline stocks plunge on warnings of the 'worst year in the history of aviation,' as one of Europe's biggest","   Reuters  Shares in major aviation stocks tanked on Thursday after German airline Lufthansa announced it would slash 22,000 jobs due to COVID-19.  Lufthansa is bracing for a slow recovery in demand and said the number of aircraft it operates will fall by 100 post-COVID-19.  Lufthansa's Frankfurt-traded stock was down 7% at 10.36 euros ($11.77) as of around 3.50 p.m. German time (9.50 a.m. ET).  The negative sentiment poured into a number of aviation stocks, most notably the big 4 US stocks saw sharp declines.  Shares in United Airlines, Delta Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines tanked in early trading, losing between 8% and 13%. As of 9.45 a.m. ET, United was the biggest loser, dropping 13%. Delta and American were close behind, down 11% and 10% respectively, while Southwest lost around 8%. While Lufthansa's huge job cuts inevitably impacted sentiment, airline stocks also reeled from a Wednesday statement by the International Air Transport Association that 2020 is likely to go down as ""the worst year in the history of aviation."" On Wednesday, Jamie Baker, an aviation analyst at JPMorgan, said he expected the recent rally in aviation stocks to run out of steam soon. ""We do not believe the current pace of equity ascent can be potentially maintained for much longer,"" he wrote, according to Marketwatch.  Aviation stocks were not alone in their plunge on Thursday. Global stocks across the board fell on the day after the US Federal Reserve presented a bleak outlook for jobs in the US and held interest rates at near-zero, and after data showed that another 1.5 million Americans filed for unemployment last week.

After Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold out," “If you want to be a millionaire, start with a billion dollars and launch a new airline.” British entrepreneur Richard Branson’s quip has become painfully relevant during the Covid-19 crisis. On Thursday, the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index dropped 14% as traders suddenly soured on this month’s equity rally, which has been fueled by a wave of retail investors throwing money at the losers of the pandemic—including aviation stocks. Even now, the index is still up 30% on the month. Would-be millionaires may learn that, in the airline industry, blanket investments don’t often end well. Mr. Branson is learning his own lesson: Back in April, he offered to mortgage his Caribbean island as collateral for a U.K. government loan to save his flagging carrier Virgin Atlantic. Warren Buffett, too, has been humbled: His investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway said in May that it had exited its large positions in all four major U.S. carriers— Delta Air Lines , American Airlines , United Airlines and Southwest Airlines —after increasing them in February. “The world has changed for airlines,” Mr. Buffett said. Many analysts expect three to five years of depressed demand for air travel. Some also fear a permanent reduction in corporate business due to videoconferencing—a big problem for full-service carriers, which make almost their entire profit on premium cabins.","Jun 12, 2020",https://www.wsj.com/articles/rich-people-say-you-cant-get-rich-investing-in-airlines-the-market-disagrees-11591954203

RELATED POSTS.","Welcome to the newly redesigned StockInvestor.com - The Go-To Resource For Investing Advice And Information June 12, 2020 @ 5:40 pm May was a month of madness for the airline industry. After a federal bailout, airline stocks began to rally before diving with the market Thursday, June 11, as if the COVID-19 market crash in March had not caused enough bumps midflight. The bad news on June 11 included an announcement from the German airline Lufthansa that it would slash 22,000 jobs due to COVID-19. The company explained that it is preparing itself for a slow recovery and added that the number of aircraft it operates will fall by 100 compared to before the COVID-19 crisis. Quickly after the company made its announcement, the Frankfurt-traded stock fell around 7%. The news spread quickly and buffeted U.S. aviation stocks, causing shares in United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL),  Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) to lose between 8% and 13%, even though all four had begun  ascension after President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act on March 27. Though it may seem as if the airlines cannot find smooth air to keep rising, the dip may be the time for savvy investors to buy at least a couple of these stocks at their reduced prices. Late-May to early-June proved that these companies are able to rally, and investment experts have been noticing.   One Investment Guru Called Delta a Buy and was Rewarded When Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) sold off its airline stocks, Mark Skousen, an investment expert, author of more than 30 books and leader of his monthly Forecasts & Strategies newsletter, spotted a buying opportunity. Even though the skies haven’t quite cleared for airline stocks or other investments battered by the effects of COVID-19, trading opportunities do exist for investors willing to take a heightened risk with call and put options. In his advisory service, Home Run Trader, he recommended his subscribers buy Delta’s stock and DAL call options. His move to take flight with both recommendations paid off. On June 2, he reported that the recommended call options had increased in value by 20% since the time of purchase.

ETFs With","Welcome to the newly redesigned StockInvestor.com - The Go-To Resource For Investing Advice And Information June 11, 2020 @ 3:14 pm Beaten down, bailed out and now shunned by many investors, airlines are facing powerful financial turbulence from the effects of COVID-19. Much commercial air travel has been grounded and left airline shareholders to wonder when the stocks of the major carriers will ascend again. U.S. airlines collectively are slated to receive around $60 billion in total bailout funds as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed by Congress and signed by President Trump. But billionaire investor Warren Buffett announced that the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) company he leads as chairman and chief executive officer sold its sizable positions in four major U.S. airline stocks to completely pull back from the industry altogether. In Buffett’s view, the headwinds facing airline stocks seem too treacherous to patiently wait for the business outlook for the companies to clear ahead. Airline Stocks Offer Trading Opportunities, But Warren Buffett Became a Seller The key questions now are, when will the airline industry begin to recover, and how? During Berkshire Hathaway’s recent virtual annual meeting, Buffett said that he made a mistake in holding his airline industry stock positions. He did not predict whether or when the airlines might recover with COVID-19 still infecting and killing people. “The world has changed for airlines, and I wish them well,” Buffett said. Option Expert Sees Trading Opportunities in Airline Stocks Offering Investment guru Bryan Perry was quick to report the effects of the Buffett’s decision to sell in his Quick Income Trader advisory service. “Delta Air Lines (DAL) was trading well until it was reported Warren Buffett sold all his airline holdings this past week,” Perry commented. “This news really beat down the sector and will take some good news on upbeat bookings to get the stock back up and running.” Perry viewed Delta’s stock as a trading opportunity, recommended May call options on the related shares in his trading service, and is looking to close the trade for a profit. That service uses a system Perry developed to produce regular cash payments every month by selling out-of-the-money call options on a select group of well-known stocks.

On June 12, the three biggest U.S. airlines saw their stocks plunge by double digits. The stocks of United Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines dropped by 16.11%, 15.51%, and 14.03% respectively, Prior to the sudden correction of the U.S. stock market, CCN.com reported top hedge funds in Asia are increasingly shorting equities. Stocks in the U.S., China, Hong Kong, and Europe saw decent gains throughout June. But, geopolitical risks and the fear of a second wave of the virus left uncertainty in the market. Hedge funds hold more than $591 billion in cash while money markets added over $1 trillion in cash. If the near-term stock market was to reverse, a sharp pullback was likely. For that reason, the smart money was never onboard on the recent stock market rally. Compared to other stocks, airline stocks were always more vulnerable since March due to their financials.

The groundings of 737 MAX passenger,"""Should you buy airline stocks?"" has been a popular searched keywords in recent weeks. Even the ""Oracle of Omaha"", Warren Buffett, decided to call it quits on its investments in the US airline stocks. A total of $10 billion worth of airline stocks! In this article, we’ll discuss our thought process on how we think the airline industry will play out, the impact from lower jet fuel prices, the CARES act & warrant dilution, timeline to return to normalisation and many more. Our goal is to build consensus on the global airline industry and what investment actions we can take today. The chart below refers to the US Global Jets ETF (JETS). This includes key players of the global airline industry, including airline operators and manufacturers from all over the world. The chart updates automatically in real-time. First, a brief overview on the airline industry. Historically, the airline industry has been extremely volatile. It has been cyclical, energy dependent, LCT (labour, capital and technology) intensive, highly regulated and extremely competitive. In addition, it’s subject to the fortunes of the economy, jet fuel volatility and natural disaster. The latter is a constant reminder of how the industry is having to face another layer of uncertainty, despite already operating in an extremely challenging business environment. We start by exploring what drives global demand for air travel. INVEST. SMARTER. NEVER MISS OUR LATEST IDEAS. The key driver of the airline industry is the passenger demand. The more the merrier. As a result, predicting what level of passenger growth is crucial to making money in this sector. As if it’s not complicated enough, the pandemic introduced another angle to this: “When will this return to normal?” To answer this, we breakdown the factors affecting demand for air travel going forward. First, GDP per capita may offer a glimpse to the trend of air travel growth in the future. Loosely speaking, this is a proxy for the income level of the population. Intuitively, this make sense, as air travel is considered a luxury good that scales with income level. In fact, the correlation between GDP per capita and passenger growth is +0.9, suggesting the strong relationship. With record level of unemployment and the death toll of coronavirus remain fresh in our minds, we struggle to see how passenger numbers would recover by end of 2021. That is, of course, on the assumption that no vaccine","Jun 11, 2020",https://www.zaginvestor.com/should-you-buy-airline-stocks-today/

UAL stock deserved to rally, but this is too far,"," The airline industry has been on fire, surging higher as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock led the rally. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) didn’t miss out either, with UAL stock ripping 169% from the May lows.  While the stock is pulling back, shares are still up about 120% from those lows, as investor optimism climbed considerably in a short period of time. Helping to fuel that optimism has been part of the “reopening America” trade. I have been noting this trade for a few weeks now, as everything from cruise operators to restaurant stocks have come roaring back to life. But that’s what this is — a trade — not an investment. There is still a lot of negativity and uncertainty surrounding these stocks. Unfortunately, UAL stock isn’t excluded from that observation. Let’s take a closer look at the business. When Warren Buffett sold his airline positions, many investors wondered why the Oracle had taken so long to exit. I’m pretty neutral toward Buffett. I don’t hang on his every word and move, but I have a ton of respect for one of the market’s greatest investors. He exited his four airline positions — United Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) — as he explained during Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting. But Buffett wasn’t looking at the next two to three weeks or even the next couple of months. He was looking years down the road. Some have predicted that airlines won’t recover 25% of their prior traffic by September. However, American Air said it plans for 50% of July 2019’s schedule to fly in July 2020. America is reopening and the public is not hesitating to book trips, pack into restaurants, and put the novel coronavirus behind them. That’s even as we’re seeing cases on the rise again.

You should check out Miller Value Partners top 5 stock picks for investors to buy right now, which could be the biggest winners of the stock market crash. In the said letter, Miller Value Partners highlighted a few stocks and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) is one of them. American Airlines is an airline holding company. Year-to-date, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) stock lost 47.1% and on June 10th it had a closing price of $17.02. Here is what Miller Value Partners said: ""We exited our position in American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) leaving us with a return of -63.7% for the period. We transitioned our investment into United Airlines as we saw greater potential upside on a recovery and less balance sheet risk. American declined with the other airlines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier in the quarter the company had announced the extension of the 737 MAX’s planned absence from their schedules until Mid-August."" Miller Value Partners believes that United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) is a better growth stock compared to American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL). Post COVID-19, United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) is expected to emerge stronger due to a strong balance sheet. In Q1 2020, the number of bullish hedge fund positions on American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) stock decreased by about 12% from the previous quarter (see the chart here), so a number of other hedge fund managers seem to agree with AAL's downside potential.

U.S. Suspends Chinese Airlines' Passenger Flights  Travel and leisure stocks saw a third straight day of declines as a second wave of coronavirus cases has emerged in the U.S. with the number of confirmed cases pushing past two million, according to data from John Hopkins University. Airline stocks plunged Thursday, including declines of as much as 16 per cent for Delta Air Lines Inc. and 14 per cent for JetBlue Airways Corp. Hotels, cruise operators, online travel agencies and car rental stocks also traded sharply lower, along with restaurants, amusement park operators, casinos and boating stocks. It was essentially a sea of red in discretionary names. The easing of stay-at-home orders across the global had sparked optimism that life was slowly returning to normal. There have been some industry-specific positive signals, as well, including airlines increasing capacity, amusement park and casinos reopening, and boating demand. The S&P Supercomposite Airlines Index has rebounded more than 50 per cent from its May 15 low, while an index of hotel, restaurants, casinos and cruise stocks was up 11 per cent for the same period compared to the S&P 500 Index’s gain of about 8.5 per cent. The second-wave scare is causing investors to seek shelter in stocks that have benefited from Americans staying closer to home. Netflix Inc., Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Peloton Interactive Inc. all traded higher Thursday despite the S&P 500 having its biggest drop since May 1.

17,Southwest Air Stock Upgraded as Leisure Travel Surge Seen - TheStreet,,"Shares of Southwest Airlines  (LUV) - Get Report soared after a vote of confidence from a top industry analyst and as the broad market rebounded after Thursday's big drop. Southwest's stock price at last check surged 9.7% to $36.03 on the heels of Credit Suisse's decision to boost its rating on the shares to outperform from neutral. Analyst Jose Caiado also lifted his price target on Southwest to $45 a share from $35. That indicates a 37% premium over the stock's closing price on Thursday. Southwest offers a way for investors to catch the tailwinds of an emerging rebound in leisure travel. And the Dallas airline also benefits from a ""best-in-class balance sheet"" that ""positions LUV to stage an aggressive comeback,"" the Credit Suisse analyst wrote. Southwest has managed to ""retain its investment grade ratings through the worst of the crisis,"" Caiado wrote, while also noting the airline has built up a $13 billion war chest.

That is comparable to or better than its peers in the airline sector, even though Southwest is half their size, the Credit Suisse analyst wrote. Southwest has also been effective in managing its debt, using money raised by a recent unsecured debt offering to pay down a credit line coming due in roughly a year in 2021, Caiado noted. The airline's strong balance sheet, in turn, should enable Southwest to lead the industry's recovery over the next 18 months, which is expected to be marked by carriers engaging in fierce low-fare competition for passengers, the analyst observed. Southwest Air's shares remain down 39% in 2020 through Thursday's close.
