0,Spirit Airlines Stock Is a Bargain After Earnings | The Motley Fool,"Spirit Airlines Stock Is a Bargain After Earnings. Earnings trends have been quite volatile at Spirit Airlines recently, but the","   2019 got off to a great start for Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), but it ended up being a bumpy year for the ultra-low-cost carrier. During the spring and summer, Spirit suffered from a sharp downturn in its operational performance, because of an unfortunate combination of aggressive scheduling, runway closures, and frequent severe weather events. This drove up unit costs. Meanwhile, unit revenue trends deteriorated as the year progressed, because of tougher year-over-year comparisons as well as changes in the competitive landscape. Even with all these headwinds, Spirit Airlines posted a double-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share for 2019 as a whole. The company's preliminary guidance for 2020 implies a similar performance this year. That makes Spirit Airlines stock look like a steal at less than nine times trailing earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Spirit's revenue per available seat mile (RASM) soared 11.4% year over year, causing EPS to nearly double. That set up an extremely difficult year-over-year comparison for the budget airline last quarter. Indeed, its initial guidance for Q4 suggested that profit would fall by more than a quarter from the prior-year period. However, a few weeks ago, Spirit Airlines revealed that it outperformed both its unit revenue and nonfuel unit cost projections last quarter. This week, it confirmed that RASM decreased just 3.6% year over year, a decent result considering the tough comparison. And while nonfuel unit costs increased 3.3%, total unit costs decreased slightly due to lower fuel prices and fuel efficiency gains from Spirit's new Airbus A320neos. Ultimately, adjusted EPS declined to $1.24: down 10% from $1.38 a year earlier. That may not seem impressive, but Spirit's results were far better on a full-year basis, with double-digit revenue and earnings growth. Revenue reached $3.83 billion, up 15% year over year, while adjusted EPS increased 16% to $5.09. SPIRIT AIRLINES' EPS DECLINED LAST QUARTER, BUT STILL ROSE ON A FULL-YEAR BASIS. IMAGE SOURCE: SPIRIT AIRLINES. Spirit expects the margin pressure that pinched its profits in the second half of 2019 to continue in the first quarter. Management is projecting a 3.5% to 4.5% increase in adjusted nonfuel unit costs this quarter, along with a 1.5% to 3% RASM decline. On the flip side, Spirit's average fuel price is on track to fall to $1.90 per gallon from $2.09 per gallon in Q1 2019, which will more or less offset the expected nonfuel","Feb 8, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/08/spirit-airlines-stock-is-a-bargain-after-earnings.aspx

4,Breeze Aviation: JetBlue founder shares details of Utah-based airline,"'Hassle-free flying': JetBlue founder unveils details of new Utah-based airline, Breeze Aviation","COTTONWOOD HEIGHTS, Utah — An air travel entrepreneur has introduced a new Utah-based airline carrier 20 years after launching JetBlue. Utah native David Neeleman unveiled the official name of his fifth carrier startup –   Breeze Aviation – on Friday, the Deseret News reported. He previously launched Morris Air, WestJet, JetBlue and Azul. Southwest acquired Morris Air in 1993, while WestJet and Azul are top-five carriers in Canada and Brazil, respectively, officials said. “I never started an airline just to start an airline,” Neeleman said. “Right now, we see some pretty gaping holes in the industry.” Neeleman has not yet announced potential routes for the carrier but has said he plans to identify and leverage nonstop flights between currently underserved airports. JetBlue route shakeup:Airline exits Oakland, shrinks Long Beach and adds Guatemala New routes:Allegiant continues push into major cities, with new Chicago, Boston, Houston flights Neeleman's approach is to prioritize a customer-centric system by taking methods from Uber and Amazon and launching an app-based toolkit that would allow passengers to find tickets, change or update travel plans, and add other travel necessities such as car rentals and accommodations, he said. “The goal is to have our customers ... never having to speak with anybody, if they don’t want to,” Neeleman said. “Add a car, add a hotel, cancel a flight, make changes, it will all be there at your fingertips. Completely hassle-free flying.” Breeze Aviation has leased 30 Embraer 195 aircraft from Azul that are expected to start flights in May, and ordered 60 new Airbus 220-300 aircraft that are expected to start flights in April 2021, company officials said. The Airbuses are suited for nonstop travel between mid-size markets, while the Embraers can cost-effectively connect smaller markets, officials said. Breeze could earn more than $1 million in tax rebates on plans to make over $3 million in capital investments and hire about 370 employees, Neeleman said. Currently, there are no plans to service in or out of Salt Lake City International Airport, but other airports in the state could see new routes, he said.","Feb 9, 2020",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/02/09/breeze-aviation-jetblue-founder-shares-details-utah-based-airline/4707609002/

Let’s recap its latest performance and check out some of the analyst predictions. By: Valerie Medleva | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) made the headlines last week thanks to its mad price fluctuations. Watching this roller coaster, the market has split in two. Some believe the stock is seriously overvalued, whereas others point out that the rally has just begun.   As this Silicon Valley electric-car maker is now attracting so much attention, everyone wonders: What does the future of TSLA look like? Ever since its IPO, Tesla’s stock has experienced extreme volatility. While fluctuating here and there, the share price managed to soar from $23.83 in June 2010 up to $383 by  June 2018. A downtrend started in November 2018 amid doubts over consumer demand and company profitability. The stock struggled through the first half of 2019, reflecting continuous change in investors’ sentiment. On May 25, 2018, its shares fell below $200 for the first time in over two years. The second half of the year saw the stock rising from the ashes. The business finally reported profits in both the third and fourth quarters, sending TSLA to new record highs. Fast forward to 2020, Tesla became the first U.S. automaker to hit a $100 billion market cap. This figure now sits at almost $135 billion.
