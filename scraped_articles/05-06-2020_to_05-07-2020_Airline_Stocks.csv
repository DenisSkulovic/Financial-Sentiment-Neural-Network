1,Why Southwest Airlines and United Airlines Stocks Tanked Today | The Motley Fool,Why Southwest Airlines and United Airlines Stocks Tanked Today. Reuters reports carriers are burning through $10 billion a month.. What,"   Shares of major American airlines got pummeled on Wednesday after Reuters detailed how the industry as a whole is burning through $10 billion a month as its most of its airplanes remain grounded due to a combination of stay-at-home orders and travelers' reluctance to sit in a confined space for hours surrounded by strangers.   In Wednesday's trading, shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) got off relatively easy, down only 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively. But United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) lost 5%, and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was down 5.6%. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. According to Reuters, nearly 50% of the more than 6,000 airplanes in the airlines' fleets are currently grounded due to government restrictions, customer apathy, or a combination of both. Those planes that are still flying are carrying an average of just 17 passengers per domestic flight, says the news agency, and only 29 passengers on international flights. No matter how many seats are filled, however, each flight still requires a fully paid crew, and a tank of gas. Mechanics must still keep the planes properly maintained. All of this costs money -- apparently in excess of $10 billion a month. Meanwhile, net bookings of paying passengers have fallen by nearly 100% year on year, Reuters says, and actual passenger traffic is down 95%. And a lot of passengers are asking for refunds on their flights, 80% or more of which have been canceled through June. In prepared statements before the U.S. Senate today, airline executives were lining up to warn Congress that, if legislators require them to pay out refunds in cash instead of awarding credits toward future travel (as the airlines would prefer), it will lead to bankruptcy. The prospect of that, it seems, was enough to scare investors out of airline stocks today.  Rich Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

News","Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris says he would buy airlines, going against fellow billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who announced that Berkshire Hathaway sold all its airline stocks at the firm’s annual meeting on Saturday.  Sawiris, chairman and CEO of Orascom Investment Holding and the only non-North Korean to hold a telecom license in North Korea, told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble on Tuesday that he sees opportunity not only in airlines, but in tourism, hotels and the internet sector. “With every crisis there is opportunity,” Sawiris said. “You can go and buy an airline today for $1 if you are assuming the bulk of the debt.” U.S. airline stocks have plunged this year as air travel demand has come close to a complete halt, dropping more than 95% because of the coronavirus pandemic. The disease has infected more than 3.6 million people globally and killed at least 256,800, according to data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University. Sawiris, speaking from Cairo, said he agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump on the administration’s controversial drive to reopen America’s economy.  U.S. stocks rose Tuesday on expectations that the U.S. economy could start to reopen. Sawiris said this is “one of the few times” that Trump is right. “They might not find the cure, they might not find the vaccine, so how long are we going to be in prison in our homes?” Sawiris said the price war between de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and Russia was a “calculated” effort to kill the shale industry in the United States, and that the Saudis got it right on oil in the long term. In March, OPEC and other major producers aligned with it failed to reach a deal to cut production, just as the coronavirus began to stifle demand for crude. Prices hit 18-year lows before the alliance reached an agreement to cut 9.7 million barrels a day in April, equaling 10% of world production and the biggest output cut in history. When asked if oil would have hit the same levels if a March OPEC+ deal had been reached, Sawiris explained that prices would have plunged anyway because of the reduction in consumption, “but it would have not fallen to this level.” “I think it was calculated,” he said. “I think they knew that this was going to happen and they still wanted to do it because, by killing a competitor, the price","May 6, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/egyptian-billionaire-naguib-sawiris-oil-prices-and-airlines.html
4,Drop Airlines! Here Are Top 10 Stocks Based On Warren Buffett's Investment Methodology,. Drop airlines! Here are top 10 stocks based on Warren Buffett's investment methodology. Warren Buffett once again showed investors,"                                           Berkshire Hathaway confirmed that in April it sold its “entire positions” in the four largest carriers - American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co, and United Airlines Holdings Inc, Warren Buffett told investors last weekend. The legendary investor sold his stake in the ""big four"" US airlines at a loss in April, going against his own advice. But, it does suggest that investors should not wait, and cut losses at the earliest. Warren Buffett exited the positions after the coronavirus pandemic which could alter the way airlines function once the lockdown opens. Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines. Also read: Warren Buffett offloads US airline stocks: Time to sell Indigo & Spicejet? Warren Buffett once again showed investors as to how one can cut losses and preserve cash, and one should just build a portfolio based on the investment climate. The investing phenomenon is dynamic in nature and usually changes over a period of time based on prevailing trends, suggest experts. “There are few cyclical sectors which see ups and downs over the course of the business cycle, and to capitalize from their undervaluation it is imperative to catch the bottom which is technically difficult,” Dinesh Rohira is a Founder & CEO of 5nance.com told Moneycontrol. “Nevertheless, the long term investor can still capitalize from such valuation gaps of quality names through a staggered investment approach at different price levels and stick to the core fundamentals of investing. The challenges in the economy are likely to persist for an extended period due to the current pandemic which might remain even for 1 or 2 years from now,” he said.

This underperformance was due to a massive drop in passenger revenues as air-travel demand remains suppressed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The likes of Delta Air Lines DAL and Southwest Airlines LUV  also put up a dismal show when they reported their respective first-quarter financial numbers in the previous week. Notably, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold its entire stake in the U.S. airline industry due to the coronavirus impact, which brought the entire space to its knees. “The world has changed for the airlines,” said Warren Buffett, who is considered one of the greatest  investors of all times, during Berkshire’s virtual shareholders' meeting. Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. United Airlines, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),incurred a loss (excluding $4.29 from non-recurring items) of $2.57 per share, comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.25. Even though operating revenues of $7,979 million decreased 16.8% year over year, the same marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,976 million. The year-over-year plunge was due to the 19% drop in passenger revenues, which accounted for bulk (88.5%) of the top line You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks (Strong Buy) here. 2.

Operating revenues of $8,515 million declined 19.6% year over year and also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,146.7 million. Passenger revenues decreased 20.5%. 3.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   While Warren Buffett abandoned the airlines, the numbers don’t support abandoning the sector or American Airlines (AAL). The stock trades at the lows despite strong government aid and plenty of financial liquidity to survive the depressed air travel in the U.S. The market is focused on some of the negative headlines, but daily air passenger totals are starting to make a nice rebound. The ultimate value of an airline stock or American Airlines in general is based on the willingness of passengers to return to the skies. With the proper focus, investors will find the prospects for American Airlines heading higher. According to TipRanks, the consensus on Wall Street is that American Airlines stock is a “sell” for investors. But TipRanks might as well have said “buy” — because analysts, on average, think the stock, currently at $9.25, could zoom ahead to $13.82 within a year, delivering 50% profits to new investors. Buffett Versus Passengers Over the weekend, Warren Buffett disclosed that Berkshire Hathaway had unloaded positions in the four major airlines with a total value once topping $10 billion. At the same time, the TSA checkpoint traveler totals are surging over 30% on a weekly basis. The passenger traffic levels are still down about 93% from 2019 levels, but the daily numbers have doubled off the lows already with 170K passengers flying over the weekend. At the same time, Buffett sold airline stocks at the lows during April as if passenger traffic wouldn’t rebound. His message to bet on America would seem to apply strongly to American Airlines and other legacy airline stocks of Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) sold by Berkshire Hathaway. Plenty Of Liquidity American Airlines ended Q1 with $6.8 billion of available liquidity and has access to another $10.6 billion from the U.S. Treasury via the CARES Act.

May 6, 2020  Warren Buffett is arguably the most respected and accomplished investor in U.S. history. He turned Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company, into a multibillion-dollar holding company. Since 1987, Berkshire’s Class A shares have delivered an impressive compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 14.91 percent. That doesn’t mean all of his investing decisions should be seen as gospel. He famously doesn’t like gold, for one. And in 2018, he admitted that he was wrong to underestimate Amazon and Google early on. “I was too dumb” to recognize the opportunity, Buffett explained. He added that he and Charlie Munger, his longtime business partner, “miss a lot of things, and we’ll keep doing it.” I believe we can add another misstep to Buffett’s otherwise successful career. This past week, the “Oracle of Omaha” revealed that he recently dumped his entire stake in the big four U.S. airlines—Delta, American, United and Southwest. As of the end of December, the position collectively stood at around $10 billion. Buffett’s decision to exit airlines seems to have stemmed directly from the coronavirus lockdown and its impact on the travel industry. In other words, it had nothing to do with how the carriers were being managed. “We were not disappointed at all in the businesses that were being run and the management,” the billionaire investor told Berkshire shareholders on Saturday. “The world changed for airlines,” he added. While I agree with Buffett that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for airlines, I disagree with his decision to dump airline stocks for that reason. Few industries have escaped unscathed from the virus’ impact, after all. Berkshire is highly exposed to banks and insurance—banks are bracing for a wave of defaults and bad loans while COVID-19 could potentially bankrupt the insurance industry—and yet we haven’t seen Buffett cut Bank of America or Travelers from his portfolio. I wouldn’t be surprised if his divestiture was also prompted in part by a general concern of the virus itself.

(NYSE: SAVE)(“Spirit”) today announced it has priced its underwritten public offering of 17,500,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $10.00 per share (the “Common Stock Offering”) and its underwritten public offering of $175,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “Convertible Notes” and such offering, the “Convertible Notes Offering”). The size of the Common Stock Offering was increased from the previously announced 12,000,000 shares of common stock of Spirit, and the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes Offering was increased from the previously announced $150,000,000. The net proceeds to Spirit from the Common Stock Offering and the Convertible Notes Offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, are expected to be approximately $335,575,000. Spirit has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 2,625,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price less the underwriting discount in the Common Stock Offering (reflecting an increase from the previously announced option of up to 1,800,000 additional shares of common stock) and a 30-day option to purchase up to $26,250,000 aggregate principal amount of additional Convertible Notes, solely to cover over-allotments, in the Convertible Notes Offering (reflecting an increase from the previously announced option of up to $22,500,000 aggregate principal amount of additional Convertible Notes). The Convertible Notes will be convertible by holders if certain conditions are met, and during certain periods, based on an initial conversion rate of 78.4314 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $12.75 per share, representing a premium of 27.5% above the offering price per share in the Common Stock Offering. Spirit will settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash, shares of common stock, or a combination thereof at Spirit’s election. Spirit expects to use the net proceeds from the Common Stock Offering and the Convertible Notes Offering for general corporate purposes.

16,Funds That Buy Like Warren Buffett | Morningstar,". . Funds That Buy Like Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett's track record may be hard to match, but plenty of","      Legendary investor Warren Buffett struck a cautious tone at the hotly anticipated Annual General Meeting (AGM) of his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). Other than imploring investors to “buy America”, Buffett isn’t excited by any opportunities in the market right now, despite the sell-off. In fact, the veteran investor has sold all his airline stocks and has increased his cash position to an incredible $130 billion. Using the latest regulatory filings, we have looked at Berkshire Hathaway’s top 10 holdings and found the UK-based funds with similar stocks. While Berkshire is listed as a company, it operates as a “best ideas” fund of more than 50 names and has a market cap of nearly $500 billion. We have looked at UK funds rated by Morningstar Analysts as Neutral and above where the stock accounts for more than 3% of the fund's assets. iPhone maker Apple (AAPL), which has a two-star rating from Morningstar analysts, takes up a sizeable chunk of Buffett's portfolio at 36.7%. Why does he like Apple? Its brand and reputation for innovation make customers loyal and, therefore, willing to pay higher prices for its products. This gives the company an enviable economic moat. Apple has long attracted investors, a major turning point for the firm was the launch of its first iPod back in 2001. Since then, the share price has risen from $1 to $310 this year, a scarcely believable gain of 30,900%. With that record, it's not surprising the stock features in a number of tech-focused funds. Morningstar analysts think the company has an economic moat, but not a wide one, because an “army of firms [such as Samsung] are targeting its dominance” and consumers are increasingly demanding newer, better products. The iPhone launched in 2007 and is the company’s “jewel in the crown”, according to analyst Abhinav Davuluri, but Apple has yet to invent a blockbuster product to match its success.  Apple is owned by three Silver-rated funds: Merian North American Equity, Polar Capital Technology and tracker fund Fidelity Index World. Apple makes up a decent chunk of the Polar Capital fund, with a 7.67% weighting in the portfolio. The active fund with the biggest weighting to Apple is Neutral-rated Janus Henderson Global Technology, which has a 8.61% exposure to the tech giant.

Many blue-chip market darlings from the pre-pandemic era have suddenly become clouded in a haze of uncertainty, rendering them closer to a speculation than an actual investment. The airlines are a prime example of a previously investible industry that’s become more of a speculative bet in the era of the insidious coronavirus. Given the new slate of risks and uncertainties brought forth by the coronavirus pandemic, previously profitable airline stocks may not be right for a majority of investors like Warren Buffett, who have no desire to bet on all-or-nothing scenarios. That’s a significant reason why Buffett cut his losses in the “Big Four” U.S. airlines in April. Not only has the short- and medium-term thesis changed on firms at ground zero of the coronavirus crisis, but their long-term fundamentals have deteriorated. Whenever you’re dealing with a potential operational interruption than could span years, the original long-term thesis may no longer hold up. And the survival of the airlines through this coronavirus typhoon? It’s not even guaranteed, as lockdowns and travel restrictions could occur intermittently for another few years in the race for a coronavirus vaccine. That said, airline stocks like Air Canada (TSX:AC) may be a spec bet that’s worthy of making for youngsters who understand the risk/reward trade-off. Their fate, however, is directly tied to the coronavirus, making them nearly impossible to value here and now. As long as investors understand that they’re essentially betting on the eradication of the coronavirus and that exogenous factors will almost entirely dictate the trajectory of the stock, only then should investors venture into airline stocks amid these unprecedented times. Just because Warren Buffett has lost faith in the commercial U.S. airlines doesn’t mean you should too. Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway still depend on the recovery of the air travel industry, with its 100% ownership of aircraft and engine component manufacturer Precision Castparts. If you lack any exposure to the airlines, whether through flight simulators, part makers, or the airlines themselves, now wouldn’t be the most absurd time to place a bet on the industry that’s on the brink. Yes, you’re venturing into the unknown, but if you’re young and able enough to stomach the risks, the rewards could be unfathomable.
