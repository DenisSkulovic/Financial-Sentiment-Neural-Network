Spirit Airlines,"U.S. Stocks broke higher on the news that the U.S. and China might reach a partial trade deal after all. When stocks or indexes open noticeably higher than the highest price traded in the previous session, traders refer to it as a gap up. Usually a larger gap is equated with a more bullish forecast for that stock or index. The fact that this gap occurred on the Friday before the start of earnings season is a rather significant, and bullish, indicator of trader sentiment. In conjunction with the market moving higher, it should come as no surprise that the Volatility Index (VIX) was observed breaking lower today. The chart below shows this in a comparison of the VIX and the two exchange-traded funds that track VIX futures prices, the Barclay's iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) and Barclay's iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures ETN (VXZ). In the chart, all three are shown breaking significantly below their recent trendlines (see chart below).  If you measure over the trailing 12 months until now, the airline industry, as tracked by U.S. Global Investors' U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), has been given a hard landing by investors. It is down nearly 10% over that time. However, the industry group and many stocks within it made significant jumps higher today. Could it be that lower fuel prices and an uptick in demand may spur rising stock prices in the quarter ahead? A comparison of how several airline stocks have been performing can be seen in the chart below. Although Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL) lead this group, Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE), and American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), all moved higher. Only Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL), which owns its own oil refinery and is less affected by a drop in fuel prices, has shown no significant gains over the past two trading sessions.

It Has,"  A weekly guide to our best stories on technology, disruption, and the people and stocks in the middle of it all.  Spirit Airlines stock is rising on Friday, after the discount carrier said that some third-quarter metrics would be better than previously forecast. The back story. Spirit stock (ticker: SAVE) is down more than 41% year to date, the worst-performing stock in a group that has struggled in 2019. At the end of last year, Spirit was a star in the sector
, however while analysts applauded
its strategy, investors’ hopes got too high. Concerns about the company’s outlook
weighed on the stock, along with fears that competition in the industry
may heat up, especially after the Boeing (BA) MAX 737 returns to service.     What’s new. Late Thursday, Spirit said that it expects total revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to be down around 2% year over year in the third quarter, although that’s better than the 2.5%-3.5% decline the company previously warned of. Spirit attributed the improvement to a smaller-than-expected impact from Hurricane Dorian and higher passenger volume. Spirit also forecast cost per available seat mile (excluding fuel) to rise 8.5%, down from the 9%-10% range, citing better operational performance despite weather disruptions. It expects third quarter capacity will be up 11.6%. The company will report full third-quarter results after the close on Oct. 23. Looking ahead. Costs have been a big concern for Spirit investors this year, so it was encouraging to see the company lowering its outlook on that front, especially citing internal factors like improved operations. Still, given how sharply the shares have fallen this year, investors may want more than one good quarter to be reassured, especially as the reintroduction of the MAX 737 looms (an event that will add capacity to the industry, with the potential to push down fares) and airlines enjoyed a fairly calm hurricane season this year. Analysts weren’t ready to endorse the shares following the news either. Credit Suisse’s Jose Caiado reiterated a Neutral rating on the shares, writing that calmer weather deserves much of the praise. Also, lackluster trends that have dogged Spirit this year haven’t abated “nor will it improve as we head into the fourth-quarter off-peak” season (before holiday fueled travel).

3,Why Spirit Airlines Jumped 11% Friday Morning | The Motley Fool,"Why Spirit Airlines Jumped 11% Friday Morning. Finally, after a challenging 2019, investors received some good news ahead of the","   Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), a discount airline operator known for cheaper base fares and options for travelers to upgrade amenities, jumped more than 11% Friday morning after the company announced some third-quarter metrics would be better than previously forecast. The conference call will be held on Oct. 24. Digging into the specifics, management now expects total revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to be down roughly 2% in the third quarter compared to the prior year. While investors would love for that metric to be better, it's not as bad as the 2.5% to 3.5% decline the company had previously guided for. Management also expects cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, to rise 8.5%, which is less than the original forecast calling for a 9% to 10% range. The driving force behind better-than-expected RASM was a smaller impact from Hurricane Dorian as well as higher passenger volume, and better operational performance was attributed to the lower-than-expected cost increase. IMAGE SOURCE: SPIRIT AIRLINES.  SAVE DATA BY YCHARTS. Friday's news was welcomed by investors, who have watched the company's stock drop 35% year to date, including today's spike, and after recent downgrades from analysts Andrew Didora of Bank of America and Jack Atkins of Stephens. Despite the downgrades, Spirit will focus on what it has done well in the past, which is lower costs as much as possible. Spirit can also boost unit revenue when it finishes installing in-flight Wi-Fi, perhaps by the end of 2020, and will continue to improve operations by culling routes that aren't as lucrative as intended. Spirit has had its challenges in 2019, but it trades at a cheap 6 times price-to-earnings ratio, and today's improved guidance could give investors hope the company can be the growth stock many believed it was.

4,Why Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Has Significant Upside Potential - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Has Significant Upside Potential. Revenue and earnings,"      Aditya Raghunath | October 12, 2019 | More on: AC Shares of Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) have been on a tear in the last few years. The stock has gained close to 500% in the last five years and is up 66% year to date, easily outperforming peers and broader indices. So, do investors need to buy the stock after its stupendous performance since 2014? Let’s have a look at the company’s business segments, revenue growth, valuation, risk factors, and more. Air Canada provides primarily provides scheduled passenger services in the Canadian and international markets. It has around 170 aircraft and a 28-member airline network. The company offers flights to over 1,300 destinations across 190 countries. Air Canada’s passenger business segments account for close to 90% of total sales, and Canada accounted for 27.6% of revenue in 2018. What has driven Air Canada’s stock higher in the last few years? The company has managed to grow sales from $14.67 billion in 2016 to $18.06 billion in 2018. Analysts expect this revenue growth to continue in the near future. Analysts estimate Air Canada sales to grow by 6.8% to $19.3 billion in 2019, 6.9% to $20.6 billion in 2020, and by 4% to $21.4 billion in 2021. Comparatively, Air Canada’s earnings are estimated to rise by a robust 48.2% in 2019 and 33.1% in 2020. Analysts expect earnings to grow at an annual rate of 19% over the next five years. Air Canada stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just 8.9, which means it has solid upside potential if you look at the company’s long-term earnings growth. The company is valued at $11.6 billion, or 0.6 times 2019 sales, which, again, indicates that the stock is undervalued. While Air Canada’s growth story is far from over, investors will be concerned over the upcoming recession. Travel companies are hit hard in a downturn, as consumers cut spending on vacations and delay their travel plans. This makes Air Canada vulnerable to negative investor sentiment. Airline companies are also impacted by rising fuel prices that drive down profit margins lower. In the last few years, oil prices have been far from volatile benefiting Air Canada and peers. Air Canada is also not a highly sought-after airline in terms of customer service. But its low-cost prices give it an edge over competitors and might stem the revenue","Oct 12, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/10/12/why-air-canada-tsxac-stock-has-significant-upside-potential/
5,7 Great Value Stocks You Can Buy But Warren Buffett Can't | Stock Market News | US News,7 Value Stocks Warren Buffett Wishes He Could Buy.

Warren Buffett once said he could earn returns of 50% a year – if only he had less money. Why? It’s far easier to make $210,000 double than $210 billion – the size of Berkshire Hathaway’s (ticker: BRK.A, BRK.B) equity portfolio. Buying a small- or mid-cap stock simply can’t meaningfully move the needle for Berkshire, and even if it was reasonable, BRK couldn’t buy a substantial stake without driving the price up or becoming a majority owner. Instead, the stocks Buffett has to buy are almost all mega-cap stocks, and to outperform an index he has to concentrate his bets. Berkshire’s top 10 holdings make up 82% of its portfolio.

6,Airline ETF Looks to Fly Through Seasonally Strong Period,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"                                 This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com. Airline stocks and sector-related exchange traded fund may find clear skies ahead as they head into a seasonally strong period. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEArca: JETS) , the lone ETF dedicated to airline stocks, has increased 3.8% year-to-date and could be poised to rally in the fourth quarter. Airline stocks, which have suffered this year on a weakening global economic outlook, have gained momentum this week on a number of positive outlook upgrades from a number of airliners, including American Airlines, Ryanair and easyJet, the Wall Street Journal reports. Seasonal trends may also be a factor behind the more positive outlook. Since 1990, the average stock market performance of U.S. airlines have increased close to 8% in the fourth quarter, the best three-month period of the year for the sector. While the broader U.S. market also tend to rally toward the year-end, the winter months may be seen as the start of a yearly turnaround for the industry. Airlines typically experience a poor summer season where earlier gains in the year are more-or-less erased by the end of the third quarter. This peak period is when airlines start to turn a profit, bolstered by holiday travel demand. Over the past few years, analysts would massively upgrade U.S. airline earnings expectations for the winter period while downgrading them in the summer, according to FactSet data. This may be partially attributed to airline analysts overreacting to bad news during the summer and then realizing that the reactions were overdone when the actual figures come in. As it stands, airlines are currently viewed in an overly pessimistic view, but the sector is still topping expectations and may not be properly reward for their performance. Consequently, investors may view this segment of the market as a value play that is not being properly appreciated. For more information on the airline ETF, visit our Airline category.

8,Do Directors Own Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Shares? - Simply Wall St News,Do Directors Own Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Shares?. What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Southwest Airlines?. Insider Ownership,"A look at the shareholders of Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) can tell us which group is most powerful. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership. With a market capitalization of US$29b, Southwest Airlines is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors, too. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about LUV. Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Southwest Airlines already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 74% of the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Southwest Airlines's historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Southwest Airlines. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our information suggests that Southwest Airlines Co. insiders own under 1% of the company.","Oct 11, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-luv/southwest-airlines/news/do-directors-own-southwest-airlines-co-nyseluv-shares

By: Josiah Wilmoth | Email | Leave a comment The Dow rampaged toward a titanic gain on Friday after President Donald Trump appeared to lay the foundation for an “early harvest” trade deal that would solve minor disagreements and prevent the trans-Pacific tariff war from escalating any further. Adding to the optimism surrounding a possible trade deal, a new report revealed that China’s “hidden capital flight” has spiked to record highs as US tariffs roil its economy. US stock indices surged at Friday’s opening bell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEXDJX:.DJI) soared 333.24 points or 1.26% to 26,829.91. The Dow now looks poised to close the week in positive territory, despite steep losses on Monday and Tuesday. The S&P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX)  jumped 35.07 points or 1.19% to 2,973.20. The index had slipped below 2,900 earlier in the week. Ten of 11 primary sectors reported gains, led by financials (+1.76%), industrials (+1.76%), and technology (+1.61%). The Nasdaq (INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC) led the market, rising 105.78 points or 1.33% to 8,056.56. The Dow and its peers sped higher ahead of President Trump’s White House meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Beijing’s top trade negotiator. Despite earlier doubts, investors now expect this week’s round of trade talks – the 13th since the trade war began – to produce a so-called “early harvest” trade deal that addresses minor issues while leaving thornier matters for future discussions.

Focus: Global equities MARKET OUTLOOK Every three out of four years, buying stocks during October has created above-average returns. That’s because most serious corrections have occurred during September or October. Personally, I prefer Oct. 24, as that date has often been about two weeks after major selloffs and an investor has to let all the sell orders dissipate before stepping into the market. Historically, the S&P 500 Index has returned about 9 per cent returns for calendar January-to-December. For our Liberty stocks, the October-to-October returns have averaged 18.7 per cent, or about double the indexes – something worth considering. During these tumultuous times, it is important to “mind your portfolio.” This means ensuring that you have: Regardless of future economic outcomes, a properly diversified portfolio can ride out the storms if we fall into recession or grow faster than the index benchmarks during the good times.

14,Four Most Oversold Dow Stocks,MORE FROM FORBES. Four Most Oversold Dow Stocks. Teaching Entrepreneurship Will Be Key To The Post-COVID Recovery. UNICEF Stockpiling 520M,"With the stock market’s positive close on Friday, October 11, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its first higher close in the past four weeks, up 0.91%. Just over a week ago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped as low as 25,743, but closed Friday at 26,816. The encouraging news regarding the U.S.-China trade talks has given investors a reason to be more optimistic on the outlook for stock prices. Given last week’s American Association of Individual Investors survey, in which only 20.3% of investors were bullish while 44.0% were bearish, there is clearly room for more positive sentiment. Chart The bullish% last week was lower than the December 13, 2018 reading of 20.9% (point 1). Some will recall that the stock market reached its low almost two weeks later on December 26, 2018. The bearish% peaked as stocks were making their low the week of December 27th at 50.3% (point 2). A bottoming-out of the bullish% sometimes precedes an upward turn in the market by a few weeks, while bearish% sometimes tops out concurrently (or later) than an upward turn in prices. Keep an eye on investor sentiment, but don't establish any positions based on sentiment alone. PROMOTED With Friday’s strong close, there is the potential for the stock market to rally further, if a trade deal is signed. Do any of the most oversold stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average look attractive for new purchase? As part of my regular stock market analytical routine, I look at where the 30 Dow stocks closed the week in relation to their starc bands. When a stock or ETF closes near its upper starc band (starc+), it is considered to be a high-risk buy and therefore overbought. Conversely, a close near the lower starc band (starc-) indicates that a stock is in a high-risk sell area (or a low-risk buy area), and is oversold. These bands were originally developed by Manning Stoller to identify price extremes and predict future stock action: when either weekly band is reached, then a move in the opposite direction has a higher probability. Therefore, when a positive signal is observed near the starc- band, the risk involved in buying is lower, and the potential reward is usually higher. These bands work equally well on all data time frames. Chart Of course, that does not mean that an overbought stock can’t go higher or an","Oct 12, 2019",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2019/10/12/four-most-oversold-dow-stocks/

16,Malaysia Airlines FY18 net loss narrows to RM791.7 million | The Edge Markets,Edition:. . TRENDING NOW. Malaysia Airlines FY18 net loss narrows to RM791.7 million. . FEATURED VIDEOS,"        KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airlines Bhd has finally filed its much-delayed accounts for its financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18), which saw the national carrier’s net loss narrowing by a marginal 2.5% year-on-year (y-o-y). The summary of financial information filed with CTOS yesterday showed that Malaysia Airlines' net loss for FY18 dropped to RM791.71 million from RM812.11 million in the previous year, as revenue improved by a slight 0.8% to RM8.74 billion from RM8.67 billion. No explanation for the results was given in the summary. In March, when Malaysia Airlines group chief executive officer Captain Izham Ismail announced the group’s overall performance for FY18 — the exact figures were not revealed then — he said the year saw intense competition, with supply outstripping demand, as well as volatility in fuel and foreign exchange (forex), which affected its profitability. Malaysia Airlines, which missed its target to return to the black last year, saw its gearing ratio (debt to equity) turn negative to 7.01 times as at Dec 31, 2018, from a positive gearing ratio of 8.39 times the year before. The last time it posted a negative gearing ratio was in FY15, which was at 13.38 times. A negative gearing ratio indicates that the airline, which is still receiving cash injection from its sole shareholder Khazanah Nasional Bhd to support its operation, is possibly in a net cash position. Khazanah, which took the airline private in 2014, has pumped some RM800 million into the national carrier via its holding company Malaysia Aviation Group Bhd so far this year alone. The summary revealed that Malaysia Airlines had total assets of RM5.12 billion as at Dec 31, 2018, down 11.41% from RM5.78 billion the year before. At the same time, its total liabilities increased 15.65% to RM5.97 billion as at Dec 31, 2018, compared with RM5.17 billion a year ago. In June, when Izham announced the airline’s performance for the first quarter ended March, 2019, he warned that 2019 is expected to remain ""extremely challenging"", given rising competitive environment and aircraft overcapacity which directly impacts yield. ""While the airline has hedged against fuel and forex, we will continue to be impacted by such external volatilities including the ongoing trade war between the US and China, and does not foresee to break even this year,"" he said.
