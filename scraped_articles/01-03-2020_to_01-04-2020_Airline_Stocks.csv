This Self-Driving Car Stock,"  Airline stocks are dropping in response to the rise in oil prices that has followed the U.S. airstrike that killed a key Iranian general in Iraq. Smart investors should consider buying the dip
because oil prices don’t actually matter
to airlines.   President Donald Trump ordered the strike in retaliation for the attack on the American embassy in Baghdad this week. It’s no surprise that the unrest in the Middle East has global stock markets dropping
. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, for instance, is down 0.6% in midday trading Friday. Oil prices are surging. International benchmark crude prices are up about 3% to more than $68 a barrel.  That price jump is punishing airline stocks
. Jet fuel, after all, is a big cost for any air carrier. Delta Air Lines (ticker: DAL) stock, for instance, is down about 1.8%.  Our suggestion that investors may want to buy at this point is a counterintuitive conclusion. Jet fuel can represent up to 25% of an airlines total expenses. But the U.S. airline industry has earned record profits when oil was about $100 a barrel and gone bankrupt when oil was $40 a barrel. Over the long run, it is the supply and demand balance between airplane seats and customers that determines industry profitability, not the absolute price of oil. Oil-price volatility, of course, matters to airlines. A rapid increase in energy costs can leave airlines with seats sold that are no longer profitable. That, however, is a short-term phenomenon and resolves itself as long as oil prices don’t continue to fluctuate widely. There are other scenarios where oil prices matter to airlines. If, for instance, oil prices rise so high that airline ticket prices become a burden for regular travelers, then demand could fall. But, as the saying goes, the cure for high commodity prices is high commodity prices, so energy prices don’t stay elevated forever. Oil prices have never risen so high as to choke off demand among travelers. Airline hedging policies can also affect industry profits. But differing energy-hedging strategies mainly shift which company earns the money. Southwest Airlines (LUV) hedges oil prices. It always has. “We are approximately 65% hedged for fourth quarter 2019,” said Southwest CFO Tammy Romo on the company’s third-quarter earnings conference call. “For 2020, we are nearly 60% hedged. For 2021, we are around 50%. And we have been adding to our","Jan 3, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-airline-stocks-fridays-surge-in-oil-prices-doesnt-matter-51578062124

Airline stocks dive as Iran tensions,"Shares of airline companies were broadly lower Friday, as a surge in crude oil prices, fueled by concerns over rising U.S.-Iran tensions, sparked fears of rising fuel costs. The NYSE Arca Airline Index XAL, -2.06%  slid 2.1% in afternoon trading, but pared earlier losses of as much as 3.2%. The Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -0.58%  , which includes six airline companies, slumped 1.1% with all 20 components losing ground. Leading the sector lower was American Airlines Group Inc.’s stock AAL, -1.73%  , which tumbled as much as 6.0% intraday before recovering slightly to be down 4.4%. Among the other Dow transports components, shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, -2.48%  fell 2.3%, Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, -1.05%  shed 2.1%, Alaska Air Group Inc. ALK, +0.36%  gave up 1.9%, JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU, +0.49%  lost 1.9% and Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -0.78%  fell 1.2%. Cowen analyst Helane Becker had said she expects 2020 to be a “good year” for airlines, despite concerns that a return to service of Boeing Co.’s BA, -0.67%  737 MAX aircraft could lead to a potential spike in supply, and some worries that business travel could be curtailed as some companies brace for slower economic growth. However, her view of a “good year for earnings and [free cash flow] generation for the industry” was based on fuel and non-fuel costs remaining “relatively stable.” Continuous crude oil futures CL00, +0.02%  climbed 3.1%, pulling back from earlier gains of as much as 4.8% to trade above $64 intraday for the first time since April 2019. The rally came in the wake of a U.S. drone airstrike that killed Qassem Soleimani, leader of the foreign wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Don’t miss: Who was Qassem Soleimani, and why is his death a major development in U.S.-Middle East relations? Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, which manages $22 billion worth of energy assets, suggested investors shouldn’t be too concerned about crude prices, as history suggests any reactionary rally on worries that Iran could retaliate “would likely only be temporary,” and given that U.S. reliance on Middle East oil is at a multi-decade low. “[Iran’s] drone attack on one of the most critical oil infrastructure assets in the world in September resulted in oil prices rising by 14% over a few days, but 30 days later, oil","Jan 3, 2020",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/airline-stocks-dive-as-iran-tensions-spark-oil-price-surge-fuel-cost-concerns-2020-01-03

CNBC Newsletters,"A U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s top military leader drove up oil prices more than 3% on Friday and sent shares in airline stocks tumbling. After labor, fuel is generally airlines’ second largest expense, and carriers are particularly sensitive to volatility in the market. All U.S. carriers were down more than the broader market. American Airlines shares were down 4.8% in morning trading, while United and Delta were off more than 3%, and Southwest lost 2.4%. Sustained higher crude prices could hurt airline balance sheets.

Discover Thomson Reuters More By Susan Mathew 3 MIN READ (Reuters) - European shares slipped from near record highs on Friday after a U.S. air strike in Iraq that killed a top Iranian commander increased Middle East tensions and spurred moves out of risk assets, while an oil price surge hammered airline stocks. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed harsh revenge after Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani, architect of the country’s spreading military influence in the Middle East, was killed in the air strike at Baghdad airport. Leaders from many other countries urged restraint. But Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index said: “As such, chances that a further escalation of tensions with Washington can be avoided, appear to be low.” The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX was down 0.3%, with German shares .GDAXI having their worst day in a month as Lufthansa LHAG.DE slumped 6.5%. Along with losses in airlines Air France AIRF.PA and EasyJet EZJ.L Europe's travel and leisure sector .SXTP shed 1.6%, on fuel price concerns as oil jumped more than 3%. The jump in oil prices lifted the regional energy sector index .SXEP to seven week highs which tied in with a weaker pound to help London's FTSE .FTSE buck the trend. “Even if we hear nothing over the weekend the events have shown that this is a complex geopolitical situation and the ongoing uncertainty will have to be dealt with for a while,” said Ingo Schachel, head of equity research at Commerzbank. Global financial markets had started the new decade on a high note on improving U.S.-China trade relations, further monetary easing in China and a brightening economic outlook. But data on Friday showed unemployment Germany rose more than expected in December, while U.S. manufacturing for the same period saw a bigger-than-expected dip. Friday’s moves tipped an otherwise flat week for Europe into red.

5,Why Airline Stocks Missed 2019 Broader Market Rally,Why Airline Stocks Missed 2019 Broader Market Rally. Why did airline stocks underperform?. Boeing MAX grounding raised investors’ concerns. Analysts’,"UPDATED 12 MONTHS AGO Airline stocks were among the few industries that lagged last year’s broader market rally. The broader US stock market had a remarkable run last year. All three of the major indexes registered double-digit gains. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite indexes rose 22%, 29%, and 35%, respectively, in 2019. However, several issues kept investors cautious about airlines’ near-term growth prospects. As a result, most US airline stocks underperformed the benchmark indexes in 2019. The best airline stock performer in 2018, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) ended 2019 as one of the worst performers. The company’s shares fell 30% in 2019 compared to a gain of 29% in 2018. American Airlines (AAL) stock, the fourth-largest US carrier by market capitalization, lost 11% in 2019. The top three US carriers recorded gains in their respective share prices. However, the gains were less than the benchmark indexes. Delta Air Lines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), and United Airlines stocks rose 17%, 16%, and 5%, respectively. The US Global Jets ETF gained 13% last year. Notably, the ETF invests in companies engaged in aircraft manufacturing, passenger airlines, and airport and terminal services. We don’t think that company-specific problems hurt airlines’ stock price last year. Instead, multiple macroeconomic factors made investors very cautious about the industry’s growth prospects. Airlines faced multiple business disruptions during the first quarter of 2019 due to the partial government shutdown and unfavorable weather conditions. Also, the intensified US-China trade war and concerns about a global economic slowdown made investors cautious about airlines’ growth prospects. Airline stocks were hit hard in mid-September following attacks on a Saudi Arabian oil refinery, which triggered global geopolitical tensions. While the factors mentioned above don’t impact airlines directly, they could hurt passenger traffic in the long run. Strained trade relations and geopolitical tensions could trigger a slowdown in the global economy. An economic slowdown situation has a negative impact on the job market, which causes people to postpone or cancel their vacations. Investors were also skeptical about a few airlines’ growth prospects due to their exposure to Boeing’s (BA) 737 MAX aircraft. Notably, Boeing 737 MAX jets have faced a global flying ban since mid-March following two fatal accidents within five months. Together, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and United Airlines own 72 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes. The airlines have suffered thousands of flight cancellations every month since the MAX","Jan 3, 2020",https://marketrealist.com/2020/01/why-airline-stocks-missed-2019-broader-market-rally/

In 2018, the global airline industry spent nearly $180 billion on fuel, representing nearly one-fourth of total operating expenses, according to an industry trade group.

9,Jeff Clark’s Market Minute: These Stocks Will Carry the Market in 2020 | Nasdaq,Jeff Clark’s Market Minute: These Stocks Will Carry the Market in 2020. More From InvestorPlace. TRENDING TOPICS. TRENDING ARTICLES. IN," 2019 was a great year for the stock market Ã¢ÂÂ one of the strongest years ever.  And typically, following that sort of performance, the next year is great too. So, while nothing is ever guaranteed when it comes to the marketÃ¢ÂÂ¦ the odds are pretty good 2020 will be another bullish year. But Ã¢ÂÂ and this is important to understand Ã¢ÂÂ we likely wonÃ¢ÂÂt see that great performance in the exact same sectorsÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Semiconductor stocks were the top performers in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:) gained 152%. Lam Research (NASDAQ:) popped 116% higher. Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) jumped 88%. But, it probably wonÃ¢ÂÂt be the big winners of 2019 that lead the market higher this year. Instead, traders should look for the laggards to play catch-up. No doubt, 2019 was a momentum-driven market. Strong stocks got stronger throughout the year. Weak stocks got weaker. And, that trend accelerated in December as institutions and money managers engaged in the art of Ã¢ÂÂwindow dressing.Ã¢ÂÂ They bought more of the marketÃ¢ÂÂs best-performing stocks so when they published their holdings at the end of the year, they could show investors they owned the markets best performers. And, they sold off the worst-performing stocks so they could show investors their limited exposure to bad performers. That action has created one of the widest valuation discrepancies between growth stocks and value stocks since 2000. You see, on a relative basis, growth stocks are historically expensive todayÃ¢ÂÂ¦ and value stocks are historically cheap.  AMD, for example, trades at 44 times 2020 earnings estimates. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs quite richly valued compared to the S&P 500, which trades for about 18 times 2020 earnings estimates. Meanwhile, value stocks like Teva Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:), which trades at less than 4 times 2020 earnings estimates, are historically cheap. GrantedÃ¢ÂÂ¦ TEVA has its issues, and the outlook is cloudy. And, AMD is firing on all cylinders and the future is shining bright. But goshÃ¢ÂÂ¦ is AMD really worth ten times the earnings multiple of TEVA Ã¢ÂÂ or any other company that actually has earnings? My point isÃ¢ÂÂ¦ the valuation gap between growth and value has expanded to a historically wide level. Growth stocks are trading for historically high valuations. Value stocks are historically cheap. If the broad stock market is going to continue higher in 2020, then itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be fueled by a Ã¢ÂÂcatch-upÃ¢ÂÂ rally in the value stocks.

Experts weigh in on how airstrike could impact stocks, oil prices. . . . . . .","             The ripple effects from Thursday night’s strike in Iran are already being felt here in the U.S. HARTFORD, CT (WFSB) -- The ripple effects from Thursday night’s strike in Iran are already being felt here in the U.S. The Dow Jones closed at down 233 points on Friday, while the price of crude oil surged by 3 percent. “A lot of volatility, specifically in the oil prices and airline stocks. Oil prices went up as a result of what happened in Iran and that can negatively impact the airline stocks. When the cost of oil goes up, the cost of transport goes up, the oil stocks have gone down,” said Eric Hogarth, partner at Johnson Brunetti. He said after a decade of record highs in the stock market, it’s time to be cautious. “If you’ve gotten good gains in the market and you’re getting closer to retirement when you need to use this money, perhaps it’s time to take advantage of selling out of some of those gains,” Hogarth said. On the roads, the 3 percent jump in crude oil prices haven’t translated to the pumps, yet. According to GasBuddy, the average price for a gallon in Connecticut is $2.63. “Oil prices go up, gas prices go up, so we’ll see continued volatility, probably for weeks, if not months, while things settle out,” Hogarth said. Some drivers say what happened Thursday night was monumental in the war against terror and don’t mind the final bill the next time they fill up. “Everyone would like to have it cheaper, but with the world the way it is today, we really have to do the right thing for our country and preserve the freedoms that we have,” said Naomi Galarza, of Rocky Hill. “Terrorists have to do with life or death. Gas has to do with money, so I’d rather have less people die than gas prices go up,” said Tyler Schiavone, of Rocky Hill. Experts say it could take weeks or months before the long-term fallout from Thursday night is seen. Copyright 2020 WFSB (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

Worried about the stock market?:How to shield your 401(k) U.S economy:If a recession hits, it would probably be mild. But a recovery would also be tame. Despite Friday's losses, analysts said investors' reaction to the attack was relatively muted. Iran could retaliate against the U.S. by disrupting oil supply in the Middle East, but it would likely be temporary, they said. ""Stocks are resilient right now,"" said Carter Henderson, portfolio specialist and director of institutional development at Fort Pitt Capital Group. “The U.S. has become more energy independent over the past decade and is less reliant on the Middle East. That's helping to ease investors' nerves."" The Pentagon launched an airstrike late Thursday that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force. He was an influential figure in Iranian politics, and his death raises fears about possible retaliation against the U.S. The Defense Department said it conducted the attack as a ""defensive action"" against Soleimani, who it said was planning further attacks on American diplomats and service members.  Oil prices jumped on concerns that Iran might respond against the U.S. Brent crude, the global benchmark, climbed $2.35, or 3.5%, to settle at $68.60 per barrel. U.S. crude rose $1.87, or 3.1%, to close at $63.05 per barrel.  During past flare-ups with the U.S., Iran has threatened the supply of oil that travels from the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. About 20% of oil traded worldwide goes through the Strait of Hormuz, where the shipping lane is only 2 miles wide and tankers have come under attack this year.

13,"Oil prices surge, stocks fall after US kills Iranian general","Oil prices surge, stocks fall after US kills Iranian general","Stocks fell broadly on Wall Street and oil prices surged Friday after a U.S. strike killed a top Iranian general in Iraq, raising tensions in the Middle East. The selling, which lost some momentum toward the end of the day, ended a five-week winning streak for the S&P 500 a day after the benchmark index hit its latest record high. The price of U.S. crude oil climbed 3.1%. Investors sought safety in U.S. government bonds, sending their yields lower. The price of gold rose. Technology, financial and health care stocks accounted for much of the selling. Companies that rely on consumer spending also fell, along with airlines.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS BY ALEX VEIGA, AP Business Writer Stocks fell broadly on Wall Street and oil prices surged Friday after a U.S. strike killed a top Iranian general in Iraq, raising tensions in the Middle East. The selling, which lost some momentum toward the end of the day, ended a five-week winning streak for the S&P 500 a day after the benchmark index hit its latest record high. The price of U.S. crude oil climbed 3.1%. Investors sought safety in U.S. government bonds, sending their yields lower. The price of gold rose. Technology, financial and health care stocks accounted for much of the selling. Companies that rely on consumer spending also fell, along with airlines. Several energy stocks got a boost from higher oil prices. Defense contractors also notched gains. The strike marks a major escalation in the conflict between Washington and Tehran, as Iran vowed “harsh retaliation"" for the killing of the senior military leader. “Until now, the two big risks have been policy -- trade and the Fed,” said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management. “This introduces a wildcard, which is a third risk: rising political tensions in the Middle East.” The S&P 500 dropped 23 points, or 0.7%, to 3,234.85.

Cowen analyst Helane Becker downgraded Air Canada to Market Perform from Outperform, while maintaining her price target at $51 per share. In her report, Becker told clients Air Canada is a “victim of their own success”, considering the company’s stock rose about 87 per cent last year. She added that at current prices there are limited catalysts to move the shares higher. As well, Becker cited “potential headwinds” that could hold back Air Canada’s short-term performance, including risks tied to the pending takeover of Transat AT. Indeed, Becker described Transat’s financial track record as “spotty”, leading to concern it “may take time” for Air Canada to make the brand sustainably profitable, which could cause earnings dilution in the first year following closing. The second headwind cited in the report is the international expansion of rival Westjet, which is now under private ownership after agreeing to a takeover by Onex Corporation which, accordingly to Becker, could allow the Calgary-based airline to become “more aggressive” in the international and domestic markets.   The report also mentioned uncertainties surrounding the return to service of the Boeing 737 MAX. The plane is being reviewed by international regulators following two fatal crashes last year. While Air Canada and Westjet are MAX operators, Becker said she expects Air Canada to be “disciplined” with the eventual re-entry of the MAX","Jan 3, 2020",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/victim-of-their-own-success-air-canada-downgraded-by-analyst-after-stock-surge-1.1368919
16,Airlines Contend With Fallout of U.S. Strike  - WSJ,The Wall Street Journal. Airlines Contend With Fallout of U.S. Strike. Concerns about higher costs for jet fuel hit share,"  Escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran buffeted airlines Friday, with concerns about higher fuel costs hitting share prices and several carriers suspending flights in the region. Three Middle East carriers canceled flights to and from Iraq, citing security concerns, after a U.S. airstrike killed a senior Iranian military leader in Baghdad and Tehran vowed to retaliate. The strike also prompted a rise in oil prices. Travel disruption was modest. Most airlines continued services to Iraq and others are still flying over that country and Iran, with regulators yet to impose additional restrictions on airspace over the Persian Gulf, one of the world’s busiest transportation routes. U.S. carriers don’t fly to the Persian Gulf region, but Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. continued flights between New York and India, which skirt to the north of Iraq and Iran. The news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.  Airlines serving the Middle East or passing through the region have repeatedly been forced to alter flight plans amid various conflicts. For instance, United temporarily suspended its flights to Mumbai and New Delhi last June after Iran shot down an American military drone. The drone’s downing prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to ban U.S. carriers from operating over the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. These restrictions on flights over the Persian Gulf, which also led other carriers to reroute some flights, remain in place, with the alternative flight plans limiting the impact of the latest tensions. Nevertheless, Bahrain-based Gulf Air, Saudi Arabia’s Flynas and Royal Jordanian Airlines all canceled flights to and from Baghdad on Friday. But the region’s bigger carriers, including Emirates Airline and Qatar Airways, continued services. Just four flights were canceled Friday at Baghdad International Airport, according to tracking service FlightAware. Royal Jordanian said it was halting its service between Amman and Baghdad “until further notice, in light of the security situation.” Qatar Airways said it would “closely monitor the situation” but continue to operate its normal schedule between Doha and the Iraqi capital. A more than 3.5% rise in the price of benchmark Brent crude oil on Friday stoked concerns among investors that a prolonged increase in fuel costs would dent profits, while regional tensions could also deter some travel plans. American Airlines Group Inc. shares closed down almost 5%, with most other U.S. carriers off by about 1% to","Jan 3, 2020",https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-contend-with-fallout-of-u-s-strike-11578087618

Ryanair shares fell after the airline group’s chief executive said it may only receive its first delivery of the grounded 737-Max aircraft, from Boeing, in October. Michael O’Leary’s comments came in an interview with German magazine Wirtschaftswoche. The 737-Max, Boeing’s fastest-selling aircraft, has not flown since last March, following two crashes, which claimed 346 lives. Last month, Mr O’Leary said that Ryanair may not receive any Max aircraft in time for its summer season. Ryanair has 135 of the planes on order, but none in service. Mr O’Leary has previously said it would not take orders in July or August, because those are the airline’s busiest months. “We were meant to have 58 planes by the summer,” Mr O’Leary said in the German interview. “That went down to 30, then 20, then 10, and the latest is maybe only five. It’s possible we’ll only get the first jets in October 2020.” Last month, United Airlines extended the grounding of its in-service Max flights until June, the longest period that any US carrier has scheduled for keeping the aircraft out of service. Boeing has been criticised by regulators, suppliers, and airlines for providing what have turned out to be unrealistic estimates for the model returning to service and, last month, said that it was freezing 737 production in January. In contrast to other airlines, which have already agreed compensation with Boeing, including Turkish, Southwest Airlines, and Germany’s TUI, Mr O’Leary said he would only discuss recompense after the planes were delivered. Meanwhile, Ryanair has also updated on passenger numbers, saying it carried 11.2m people across its European route network in December; an increase of 9% on the same month in 2018. That figure covers both Ryanair and the Austrian budget airline, Lauda. However, the overwhelming bulk of those passengers were attributable to the main Ryanair brand. Last month, Ryanair trimmed its passenger traffic forecasts, saying it would cut summer capacity and an unspecified number of jobs, as a result of further delays in returning the 737-Max aircraft to service. Ryanair shares fell by more than 2%, before paring back some of those losses to close at just over 1%.
