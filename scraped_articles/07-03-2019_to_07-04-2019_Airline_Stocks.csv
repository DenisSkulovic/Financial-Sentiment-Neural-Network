0,How Airline Stocks Have Fared in the First Half of 2019,How Airline Stocks Have Fared in the First Half of 2019. Bumpy ride. Why airlines underperformed. How analysts view airline,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Airline stocks have had a rough ride in the first half of 2019, and the majority of them have underperformed the broader markets. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), whose portfolio consists of cargo and passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport and terminal services stocks, gained just 8.4% in the first half of 2019. The ETF underperformed major US indexes, including the Dow Jones, the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500, which gained 14%, 20.7%, and 17.3%, respectively, in the same timeframe. Among the major US air carriers, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) is the worst performer with a 17.6% loss as of the end of June. United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Hawaiian Holdings (HA), and Alaska Air Group (ALK) increased in the low-single-digit range of 4.6%, 1.6%, 3.9%, and 5%, respectively, during the same timeframe. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) were the few carriers that recorded a double-digit gain in their share prices of 13.7% and 10.1%, respectively. Multiple factors were responsible for airline stocks’ dismal performance during the first half of 2019. Rising concerns of a global slowdown and uncertainty over the US-China trade negotiations kept the entire market highly volatile throughout this year. Moreover, investors turned cautious over airlines’ growth prospects after the majority of them reported sluggish top-line growth in the first quarter of 2019. The carriers faced massive flight cancelations during the quarter due to the partial government shutdown in January, severe winter conditions, and the worldwide ban on Boeing (BA) 737 MAX planes. Airlines stated that the factors mentioned above negatively impacted their overall financial performance in the first quarter. In a March 27 regulatory filing, Southwest Airlines disclosed over 9,400 flight cancelations in the first quarter due to unfavorable weather, unscheduled maintenance disruptions, and ongoing troubles with MAX jets. American Airlines faced 2,140 flight cancelations due to government shutdown and the grounding of its 24 Boeing 737 MAX planes. Boeing 737 MAX jets have been banned from flying after two deadly accidents that killed 346 people. Industry experts believe that Boeing would get safety approval for its troubled jets by October and then airlines would be able to resume their MAX services by the end of December. Southwest, American, and United Airlines together own 72 737 Max aircraft. Southwest Airlines has announced removing all its MAX flights from the flying schedule through October 1.

2,Boeing’s 737 MAX Problem Might Be Good News for Delta Stock and Other Airlines | Barron's,Boeing’s 737 MAX Problem Might Be Good News for Delta and Other Airlines. Here’s Why.. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily.,"  A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.  The grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX
has generally been a headache for the airline industry, but some carriers, such as Delta Air Lines, are actually benefiting from it, some analysts say.  Taking the MAX out of circulation
has trimmed U.S. airline capacity, which led to higher airfares, according to some.  Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi estimates that the 737 MAX shaved 2% of U.S. airline capacity in the second quarter. And lower capacity is, in part, responsible for Delta Air Lines’ better-than-expected revenue growth
. Delta Air Lines (ticker: DAL) sales grew faster than 8% in the second quarter, better than the 7% growth guidance provided by management in April.  Read more:Boeing Stock Has Much Bigger Things to Worry About Than the 737 MAX  “Delta has a about 12.5 billion competitive [available seat miles] overlap with MAX routes,” which equates to about 30% of Delta’s domestic capacity, DeNardi explained in a Wednesday research report. Available seat miles, or ASMs, is an industry capacity measure calculated by multiplying the total number of seats by the total number of miles flown. With the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX unlikely to fly until the fourth quarter (at the earliest), DeNardi believes Delta’s pricing will remain strong. DeNardi rates Delta stock Buy with a $90 price target, about 52% higher than recent levels. The impact of the MAX grounding extends beyond Delta. Southwest Airlines (LUV) flies an all-Boeing 737 fleet
and has 34 MAX planes parked, leading to about 150 fewer flights a day. That is about 4% of Southwest’s peak capacity, according to calculations by Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard.  Southwest has removed the MAX from schedules
through October 1, but CEO Gary Kelly thinks the timeline will slip further, according to Stallard. Southwest wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Both American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) have removed the MAX from schedules through September 3. Cowen analyst Helane Becker expects American will push the expected re-entry to service date further out when it releases a second-quarter capacity report in coming days. DeNardi appears correct in highlighting Delta as the main beneficiary of Boeing’s woes. Delta’s shares have returned almost 19% year to date, better than the 16.5% return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

4,Ryanair Shares: Where Next? | Ryanair and Brexit | IG EN,Ryanair shares: short-term pain for long-term gain. Ryanair prioritises growth over earnings. Ryanair has a more cautious outlook than its," The market is tough; a restructuring is underway and severe measures have been introduced in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit. We have a look at the investment case for Ryanair. It is a turbulent time for the European airline industry. Airlines are grappling with significantly higher costs at a time when competition is intensifying, and many have raced to consolidate to survive. Still, we have already seen three airlines collapse since the start of the year - Flybmi, Germania and WOW Air – and they will certainly not be the last. Ryanair chief executive officer (CEO) David O’Leary warned in May that the airline was facing a ‘painful’ couple of years and the Dublin-based firm has a far more pessimistic, or realistic, outlook compared to its peers. However, while the entire industry is battling against numerous headwinds, from rising fuel costs to the threat of Brexit, Ryanair has its own problems to solve too. Ryanair shares have fallen more than a third over the last 12 months and have lost 45% of their value since hitting an all-time high in the middle of 2017. With shares now trading at levels not seen for more than four years, we have a look at what is weighing on the Ryanair share price and consider where it is headed next: Ryanair’s average fare in the year to the end of March 2019 fell 6% to just €37. The number of available seats on short-haul flights has increased and this has put pressure on many airlines, particularly low-cost carriers like Ryanair, which would rather fill its planes by offering rock-bottom fares than fly half-empty planes. Fares are so low that low-cost carriers are losing money. Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air are only managing to make a profit by squeezing out additional revenue from ‘ancillary services’. These include all the extras passengers pay on top of their ticket, such as baggage. Source: Ryanair financial reports. Financial years to the end of March Although the reduction in fares has capped the growth in revenue it generates from tickets, up just 1% in its last financial year, ancillary revenue jumped 19% thanks to more passengers coughing up for priority boarding and to reserve seats. Fares may be low, but it seems customers are willing to spend more on extras as a result. This strategy may have allowed overall revenue to grow by 6% in the","Jul 3, 2019",https://www.ig.com/en/news-and-trade-ideas/shares-news/ryanair-shares--short-term-pain-for-long-term-gain-190703

But Deluce said Porter, a privately-held airline that offers flights within Canada and the United States, is currently well-positioned in the industry, and that the airline isn’t having any discussions around consolidation. “The business is not for sale,” he said. “We’ve actually put in place some measures more recently to restructure our management team, particularly our senior executive [team], that sets us up for the long term to make sure we can achieve some of those longer-term goals we have in place.” Deluce said that while the potential deals involving WestJet and Air Canada haven’t had any visible impact on the Canadian airline market yet, Porter","Jul 4, 2019",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/porter-is-not-for-sale-despite-recent-wave-of-airline-consolidation-deluce-1.1282680

Subscribe to The Canadian Technician to be notified whenever a,"Much is made of airline on-time departure. This article from the Huffington Post revealed that Air Canada had twice the percentage of late departures as Russia's Aeroflot. Air Canada also dramatically underperforms many other competitors, including Alaska Airlines and Westjet. These three competitor airlines in particular also hub out of northern climates, which prove that it's not the weather that's responsible. Extreme weather only accounts for 5% of the US industry flight delays, but late-arriving aircraft were responsible for 42%. Canada's industry has decided not to keep these statistics, according to the article.  Air Canada made two out of three flights with an on-time departure. It was also alarming to see Air Canada rate worse than Air Transat and perform in the same neighbourhood as Sunwing in the HuffPost article. While Toronto Pearson is Air Canada's main hub, the airport is ranked at 475th overall, one of the world's worst. The on-time performance at the airport was also the worst of the primary airports in Canada. Perhaps that might be the main tenant creating the problem, or possibly the other way around. The dismal on-time performance of Air Canada in the international and domestic airline peer group is clearly disappointing and makes you wonder how an airline can be an industry competitor with that as a backdrop. This would be a difficult backdrop for you to expect great things from the stock.  As an investor, I can't help but be more convinced that something is weird under the wings of Air Canada when I look at the stock chart. When one tries to correlate the earnings, the peer group results, industry metrics or passenger experience to the stock price, it seems as uncorrelated to reality as an Enron chart. Enron famously outperformed their peers right up until they didn't. Analysts kept believing until the month before bankruptcy. This huge divergence from the peer group has my antennae up. There may be nothing wrong, but there could also be a wreck. For me, the price action of the stock is king, not analyst opinion. Something about 500% compared to no gain smells odd. We can learn from past mistakes.

8,Using portfolio diversification to manage systematic and unsystematic risks - Standard Chartered Singapore,. Using portfolio diversification to manage systematic and unsystematic risks. Learn the factors that cause systematic and unsystematic investment risks,"                                                         You’ve heard the adage of not putting all your eggs into one basket — that’s diversification in a nutshell. But how can investors use this concept to manage investment risk?   Let’s first understand the two major risk categories, systematic and unsystematic risks. Systematic risk is the type of risk that underlies an entire system, be it the stock market, the real estate market or even the global economy. Unsystematic risk, also referred to as specific or idiosyncratic risk, is specific to a particular asset like a stock or property, or a similar group of assets such as technology or airline stocks. The factors that contribute to each type of risk are different. For systematic risk, aspects like interest rate changes and recessions can cause entire markets to move. For unsystematic risk, the factors are more localised, like business failure of a specific company or industry (e.g. an airline crash affecting airline stocks or increased privacy regulations affecting technology stocks). While all investments are exposed to both types of risks on some level, diversification can help manage them to some extent.   The idea behind diversification is simple: by diversifying your investment portfolio, you are spreading your risks around. Hence, a dip in a single security or asset class will not have as large a negative effect. The key to this is correlation — offsetting the risk of one type of asset against another. Correlation is the degree by which two securities move in tandem. For example, an index fund that tracks the Straits Time Index will be perfectly correlated with the index. On the other hand, gold prices and bonds are lowly or even negatively correlated with stocks, meaning their prices don’t move in tandem, and sometimes may even move in opposite directions. A well-diversified portfolio thus consists of groups of assets which are lowly or negatively correlated with each other. An investor holding a portfolio of 30 different technology stocks is not diversified at all.

How Do I Calculate ROE?. What","Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card! One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE). Spirit Airlines has a ROE of 13%, based on the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn $0.13. Check out our latest analysis for Spirit Airlines The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders' Equity Or for Spirit Airlines: 13% = US$257m ÷ US$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2019.) Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets. ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies. Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Spirit Airlines has a lower ROE than the average (19%) in the Airlines industry classification. That's not what we like to see. We prefer it when the ROE of a company is above the industry average, but it's not the be-all and end-all if it is lower. Still, shareholders might want to check if insiders have been selling. Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this","Jul 3, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-save/spirit-airlines/news/with-a-13-return-on-equity-is-spirit-airlines-inc-nysesave-a-quality-stock

Ahead of the Tuesday afternoon release of the company's highly anticipated second-quarter delivery results, which surprised to the upside by setting new delivery and production records, experts warned that even a fundamental win won't correct the technical breakdown in Tesla's stock. ""If you want to own a company like this, you believe in [CEO] Elon Musk, as I do — and I've owned it in the past — you're owning the belief in the entrepreneur, the optimism surrounding the technology, but you cannot own this stock on a fundamental reason at all,"" Quint Tatro, chief investment officer at Joule Financial, said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""It's very, very difficult. There's really no financials to speak of,"" Tatro said, citing the company's plans to raise capital through equity and debt markets. ""There's no reason to be a buyer here, or, quite frankly, until they get these financial numbers figured out and we know, really, where the company stands."" Tatro deferred to Craig Johnson, managing director and senior technical research analyst at Piper Jaffray, whose technical analysis reinforced the gloom hanging over Tesla's stock, which is down nearly 30% year to date. ""When you look at the chart, you'll see that this is a stock that had broken below a multiyear consolidation range channel,"" Johnson said in the same ""Trading Nation"" interview. ""It's having a nice little relief rally in here, but unless this stock can recapture the lower end of that consolidation range around $240, I suspect that the stock is perhaps going to stall here."" If it does stall, Johnson expected another leg lower, diverging from his firm's Tesla analyst, Alex Potter, who rates the stock a ""buy"" with a $396 price target. Tesla shares were trading around the $237 level early Wednesday. ""Technically, we look at this chart with a little bit more of a cautious perspective, as we haven't recaptured that trading range, and it still looks like just a relief rally to us,"" Johnson said.

12,Why The AV Revolution Will Give Southwest Airlines No LUV - Towards Better Questions,GOOD BUTTONS TO CLICK:. Why The AV Revolution Will Give Southwest Airlines No LUV. Post navigation,"Towards Better Questions Mostly tech, sometimes random, always interesting. Question: Why won’t you want to own regional airline stocks in the future?  Better Question: Why would you ever fly from Chicago to New York again?  If I were the CEO of Southwest I’d be terrified of the dawn of self-driving cars.  The average Southwest flight is 757 miles and takes roughly 2 hours.   Aviation contributes 5% of global emissions, making a growing share of consumers unhappy about flying.  I predict that as self-driving vehicles take over, most people will opt to drive to their destination while they sleep.    Assume an overnight AV trip takes 12 hours, including an hour to recharge and take occasional breaks.  The current record for a Tesla is 670 miles on a single charge, which can be expected to increase as battery efficiency improves, making driving 11 hours feasible.  An AV going 70 mph (the current interstate speed limit) you could easily travel 770 miles overnight. With no need for controls, and the engine replaced by small electric motors, chairs will be able to recline into lie-flat beds.  Imagine relaxing in business class…in the backseat of your own car.  In the future, should you wish to travel from Chicago to New York you’ll have a choice.  Option A: Drive to the airport, check in, wait in security lines with hundreds of other people, experience a delay, eat unhealthy food, experience another delay, all while contemplating why bottled water costs 3x the normal price, and then buying it anyway.   OR… Option B: Get in your AV, stretch out, relax, read, work and then lie flat to sleep, only waking up when your car announces that you’ve arrived at your destination.  Hmm. I’m pretty sure I’ll grab my book, reusable water bottle, laptop and pillow, and head for my AV.  How far could you travel in your sleep?  Consider the following:   Once AV’s are a reality, a traveler starting in San Francisco could go anywhere in the green circle. Start in New York and reach any spot in blue.

Despite an improvement in oil prices, upstream players are giving more emphasis on generating free cash flow and are becoming much disciplined about capital spending decisions. In addition to reducing the demand for oilfield services, this shift in customer strategy has also put pressure on the pricing of Core Labs’ products and services. Along with conservative capex by North American energy producers, the U.S. shale activity is feeling the heat from the lack of takeaway capacity. Logistical constraints in major shale plays like Permian are forcing producers in the region to sell their output at hefty discounts. This caused upstream companies to slowdown drilling and production activities, thereby impacting demand of oilfield services firms like Core Labs. Lackluster international and offshore activities also raise concerns. In addition to weakness in international markets, GoM and other deepwater provinces have been bearing the brunt of sluggish operations. While the company is undertaking initiatives to manage its diverse portfolio of proprietary products and services, a tough operating environment is likely to hamper Core Labs’ performance. The firm requires robust international and offshore activities to provide earnings and cash flows leg-up. While things have gradually started looking up for international, offshore and deep-water markets, with various new projects about to get green lit in 2019, the recovery is still not around the corner. Meaningful recovery in international and offshore activities will require sustained higher oil prices.

However, when Wall Street returns to action on July 5, the real stock market fireworks could begin. The catalyst? You guessed it: the trade war. According to the South China Morning Post, China has demanded that the United States must immediately eliminate every single tariff it levied on Chinese imports during the trade war if Trump has any hope of negotiating a trade deal. “The US tariff hike on Chinese products was the trigger for bilateral trade frictions, so all the additional tariffs imposed since [the beginning of the trade war in July 2018] must be scrapped once there is a deal,” Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng reportedly said during a Thursday media briefing. That’s a problem for President Trump, who has repeatedly maintained that not only will tariffs remain in place during negotiations, but also that some tariffs will remain in force indefinitely to “make sure…that China lives by the deal.”   Trump’s refusal to relinquish tariffs as a bargaining chip is reportedly one reason that negotiations broke down in early May. Two months later, with the two sides finally ready to return to the negotiating table, it seems that neither country is prepared","Jul 4, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/dow-jones-fourth-of-july-trade-war/
