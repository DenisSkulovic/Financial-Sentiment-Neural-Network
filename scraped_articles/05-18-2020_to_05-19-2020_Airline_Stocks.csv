2,Why Airline Shares Are Soaring Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Soaring Today. Stocks are rallying on reports of progress in the fight against COVID-19.. What happened.,"   We've been saying for weeks now that airlines, thanks in part to a government cash infusion, are in no immediate danger of liquidity issues, but the industry needs traffic to normalize in the months to come to avoid dire consequences. Monday brought promising news on the vaccine front, and that's helping to push airline stocks, and the broader market, higher. Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) are up 21% as of noon Monday, while shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) are up 17%, and shares of Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) are up more than 11% apiece. Other airline stocks are also beating the market, with Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) up 10%, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) up 8%, and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) up more than 6%. The COVID-19 pandemic has wiped out demand for air travel, causing airline stocks to lose more than half of their value year to date and raising real questions about the industry's future. The airlines came into the crisis relatively healthy and have added cash in the months since the pandemic began, giving them some cushion. But it will be difficult for the stocks to take off with so much uncertainty remaining about the duration of the pandemic and what the economy will look like when it is over. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The market on Monday cheered positive news from biotech Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) about promising early results from a clinical trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The best-case scenario for airlines would be for a vaccine to be rapidly developed, allowing travel to normalize quickly and revenues to return. There is some company-specific news driving certain stocks on Monday as well. Before markets opened, Spirit Airlines was upgraded to outperform by Evercore ISI, and Delta announced it was resuming some key international routes suspended due to the pandemic. United, meanwhile, had been beaten down harder than most last week due to a number of company-specific headlines and was due for a rebound. JetBlue, due to its business model, will likely need more of a full economic recovery, and not just normalized recession-level traffic, to really rebound. Moderna's clinical trial is without doubt good news, but it is only the first step in a long process. The trial was only conducted on eight participants, and further research is needed. The company hopes to begin","May 18, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/18/why-airline-shares-are-soaring-today.aspx

4,3 Airline Stocks to Bet on After the Coronavirus Crash,3 Airline Stocks to Bet on After the Coronavirus Crash,"Now that we’re beginning – just beginning – to emerge from the anti-coronavirus shutdowns, and the economy is starting to open up, one obvious question is begging for an answer. The restart, of society of the economy, will depend on the success we encounter in lifting trade and travel restriction. How soon will that happen, and will it happen soon enough? For the airline industry, at least one answer may be obvious: the restart cannot come soon enough. Airlines have famously thin margins, and with long-distance and international travel simply stopped and air traffic down by 90%, they have been hemorrhaging cash. While the larger airlines may have the resources to survive, there is no doubt that at least some smaller airlines will go under. Writing from Credit Suisse, airline industry analyst Jose Caiado sees some hope. Low share prices now make an attractive point of entry, and Caiado notes that, as society reopens, air travel will inevitably resume its essential function. There is simply no other efficient way to handle rapid long-distance travel. The key for investors will be finding those airlines best positioned to both to weather the downturn and quickly resume operations. “We believe industry has adequate liquidity to bridge through to an eventual demand recovery, which we expect towards the end of 2020. However, balance sheets are now heavily burdened with incremental leverage, and debt reduction will become industry’s primary strategic objective as it emerges from the crisis,” Caiado noted. On a practical note, for investors, Caiado points out three airlines that are solid bets to survive the corona crisis and make gains in the restart.

6,The Airline ETF Looks Like a Cheap Long-Term Opportunity | ETF Trends,The Airline ETF Looks Like a Cheap Long-Term Opportunity. RELATED TOPICS. FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER. SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER!.,"The coronavirus pandemic has weighed on global airline stocks and the sector-related exchange traded fund, but investors should consider the potential long-term benefits of entering the market during a recovery period. In the recent webcast, Airlines Have Weathered Storms Before, Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Global Investors, pointed out that there has been heavy investment interest for airline stocks as the sector plunged into oversold territory last seen since 9/11. Holmes argued that airline stocks look attractive, with the NYSE Arca Global Airlines Index recently showing a record low 14-day RSI that reflected airline stocks traded at their most oversold since September 2001. Airline stocks are also trading at attractive discounts to other segments. The New York Arca Airline Index showed a price-to-earnings of 5.7 as of the end of March, compared to the 14.5 P/E ratio for the S&P 500 Industrials Index, 20.1 P/E for the Dow Jones U.S. Trucking Index and 15.6 P/E for the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index. Meanwhile, investors took a significant interest in airline stocks, trying to catch the bottom. Specifically, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEArca: JETS), the lone ETF dedicated to airline stocks, experienced 44 consecutive days of inflows ended May 5, adding over $600 million in net inflows over the period. JETS may even be used as a tactical portfolio investment tool to capitalize on specific market views across short-term periods. U.S. Global has witnessed sophisticated traders shorting weaker names to potentially profit from underperformers while profiting from the long ETF, which would help reduce volatility for the pairs trade. For instance, traders have shorted Ryanair while holding long JETS, or shorting JETS and going long Spirit Airlines to place a view on individual names outperforming the basket of airlines. Airline companies have exhibited a history of resilience, making a strong recovery after previous periods of uncertainty. For example, airline stocks advanced 80% in the six months after the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. The sector surged 120% in the six months after the SARS scare. Additionally, airline stocks returned 80% in the six months after the global financial crisis. The airline industry also received more support to get back on its feet during the current crisis. The CARES Act included an aid package to strengthen the airline industry, with half in the form of grants to cover some 750,000 airline staff wages.

Airline stocks are surging on Monday, but investors keen on chasing the rally will have to make their picks wisely. By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. Saudi Arabia went bottom fishing in the U.S. stock market last week. A handful of stocks benefitted, and beleaguered planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) was one of them. The kingdom’s $300 billion Public Investment Fund revealed that it bought up $714 million worth of BA stock to diversify its portfolio away from oil. The news perked Boeing stock up, and the gains accelerated on positive coronavirus vaccine news. Boeing wasn’t alone in its ascent; airline stocks rose across the board on renewed optimism. Perhaps the most promising news for airline stocks came from biopharmaceutical firm Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). Investors cheered the firm’s promising test results from its coronavirus vaccine trials, where all 45 human participants developed Covid-19 antibodies following treatment. The testing data show the vaccine has an impact on coronavirus patients even in small doses. A press release from Moderna celebrated the early success and injected a healthy dose of hope into financial markets: With today’s positive interim Phase 1 data and the positive data in the mouse challenge model, the Moderna team continues to focus on moving as fast as safely possible to start our pivotal Phase 3 study in July and, if successful, file a BLA.

9,Here’s why Warren Buffett bought and then dumped his airline stocks once again,Here’s why Warren Buffett bought and then dumped his airline stocks once again. The 1978 Airline Deregulation Act. Buffet’s first,"The Wright brothers’ ingenious invention of the airplane has given man the gift of flight. Since then, aviation has paved the path for international trade and tourism, which have played central roles in global economic prosperity. In 2019, the world’s airlines carried 4.5 billion passengers, while air transport carried 0.5% of the world trading volume that represented 35% in shipment value.  It’s a huge industry generating US$704.4 billion per year. In fact, the aviation industry would rank 20th globally in GDP terms with a size close to that of Switzerland’s. Despite the economic significance of aviation, airlines are not as profitable a business as we think they are. It is a capital-intensive business with little to no profits to show. Billions of dollars, mostly funded by debt, are spent on growing their fleet of aircraft. The airlines then incur high fixed and variable costs, primarily from aircraft maintenance, labour, and fuel costs. Airlines that expanded aggressively during an economic upcycle often experienced difficulties covering their overheads and servicing their debt in future economic downturns, causing their bankruptcy. The question is, if airlines were such terrible businesses as Warren Buffett described them to be after admitting he made a mistake investing in US Airways in 1989, why did he invest in the four major American airlines (i.e. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines) again in 2016? In this article, we will explore Buffett’s relationship with airlines chronologically — when and why did he make those purchases of airlines, and what went wrong? To better understand Buffett’s decisions, we need to understand the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. Prior to the act, airlines were basically guaranteed profitability. The federal government controlled the entry and exit of participants in the airline industry, making the industry an oligopoly. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) would determine the routes and prices of the airlines, and these very generous pricing structures allowed airlines to fly profitably despite filling only about half of the airplane’s capacity. However, in 1978, the Airline Deregulation Act effectively shifted the control of the air travel market from the political to the market sphere. Subsequently, the increased competition in the air travel market lowered air ticket prices, making it more affordable for the average air traveller. This explains why the load factor that airlines require to breakeven today is much higher than before (between 72.5% and 78.9%).

11,A Historical Look at the Airlines : stocks,A Historical Look at the Airlines. A Historical Look at the Airlines,"I’ve remained bearish on the airlines for the past couple months yet the community seems to have a different perspective. In an attempt to understand why so many remain bullish I decided to take a look at how the airlines recovered following the last crises (9/11). I’ve broken down my analysis in order of the airlines market share at the time the last crises started. I’ve also shown what your return would be if you bought in late 2001 and held until today. For context, an investment in the S&P 500 would have netted a return of 223% 1. American (-70% ROI): Despite declaring bankruptcy, investors in American Airlines (Formerly $AMR, now $AAL) would still have a portion of their investment if they held since 2001. It’s highly unlikely investors would have held through the bankruptcy which saw $AMR get delisted and trade as low as 20c a share, but for those that held through the bankruptcy they could have sold for a gain of 100% in December, 2019. Realistically, for someone who invested in 2001, they would have realized gains no higher than 33% and likely sold at some point leading up to the bankruptcy. 2. United (-100% ROI): The original $UAL stock was wiped out during United Airlines bankruptcy proceedings. It was re-issued under $UAUA until it reverted to its original ticker $UAL after its merger with Continental airlines. Investors in 2001 would have lost their entire investment if they held without selling. On a positive note, for individuals that invested after the re-issue, they could have realized gains as high as 150%, assuming perfect market timing. 3. Delta (-100% ROI): Delta Airlines faced the same fate as United, during their bankruptcy proceedings their stock was cancelled leaving investors with nothing. After emerging from bankruptcy they merged with Northwest Airlines and reissued stock under the ticker symbol $DAL. 4. Northwest (-100% ROI): Northwest Airlines also had their stock cancelled during their bankruptcy proceedings. They merged with Delta in 2008. 5. US Airways: (-100% ROI): Another airline that declared chapter 11 bankruptcy and cancelled their shares. US Airways later merged with American Airlines and currently trades under $AAL. 6. Continental (0% ROI???): Historical data for $CAL is hard to come by. From what I can find $CAL was never delisted or cancelled as Continental airlines never declared bankruptcy in the 2000s. They later merged with United where $CAL shareholders","May 18, 2020",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gl6zrm/a_historical_look_at_the_airlines/
12,DAL Stock: Delta Is the Best Airline Positioned For a Rebound | InvestorPlace,Delta Is the Best Airline Positioned For a Rebound. Delta expects sharply reduced passenger volumes for later this year. DAL," Stuck in a trading range at close to $20 a share, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) needs a single catalyst to take off again. Namely, a successful re-opening of the U.S. economy while minimizing the spread of the novel coronavirus. Investors holding DAL stock right now will need to brace for the high cash burn rate, the excess pilots, and fears of a second wave hurting flight traffic. In a memo to its flight operations employees, John Laughter, Delta’s senior vice president of flight operations, said the airline will have an excess of 7,000 pilots this fall. “I recognize that is an alarming number so it’s important to know that our intent is to align staffing for what we need over the long term,” he said in the memo. Laying off staff down the road will add to an airliner’s costs. But investors cannot try to accurately predict how many pilots that airlines will need a year into the future. More likely, Delta has 2,500 more pilots than it needs by the third quarter of next year. On May 14, Delta said that due to expectations of a slow turnaround in international long-haul travel, it will retire its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 fleet. CEO Ed Bastian said that “for the next two to three years, a smaller network, fleet, and operation in response to substantially reduced customer demand.” The company is unlikely to reverse its decision of fleet consolidation. It aligns with its objective of cutting excess operating costs. So, the sharply reduced demand in flights allows Delta to address the excess costs. The airliner’s Airbus A350 will take on the route between Sydney and Los Angeles by the end of this year. With the U.S. and most of the rest of the world barely in the early phases of re-opening, worries over the second wave of Covid-19 is hurting DAL stock. The concerns are not fearmongering. The World Health Organization warned on May 15 that the virus will be hard to wipe out completely. If the persistence of the virus a new reality, then Delta must adapt. When flight volumes increase and demand improves, Delta cannot carry a 100% passenger load. And if Congress demands that airlines fly with one or more empty seats between passengers, Delta’s profit margins will shrink. That maximum load suggests each flight will run at 67% capacity at the most.

13,Delta Air Lines Stock Has Plenty of Upside From Current Depressed Levels | InvestorPlace,Delta Air Lines Stock Has Plenty of Upside From Current Depressed Levels. DAL closed Friday at its lowest level yet," Few sectors are hurting as badly from the novel coronavirus as the airline industry. Unlike other stocks that also took a hit as a result of the pandemic, airline stocks never had much of a recovery, despite significant government financial support. And Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) — one of the largest shareholders in airline stocks — dumping its holdings certainly didn’t help. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has continued its downward spiral, with a Friday close of $19.19 that represented a new 2020 low for DAL stock.  When Delta released its results for the March quarter, the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on its operations was in the spotlight. And it was dire. Passenger volume on Delta international flight was down by 90%. Domestically, it was down 80%. 650 planes were parked indefinitely. Those planes that were still flying required elaborate, time-consuming (and costly) decontamination procedures after every flight. By the end of March, the company was burning through $100 million per day. The situation looks just as grim in the short-term. Delta CEO Ed Bastian noted: “Government travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders have been effective in slowing the spread of the virus, but have also severely impacted near- term demand for air travel, reducing our expected June quarter revenues by 90 percent, compared to a year ago” Airline stocks got a boost on hopes of government assistance. However, when the Senate approved a $2 trillion stimulus package on March 26, DAL stock quickly began to slide once again. Under the terms of the CARES Act, Delta received $3.8 billion in grant money and $1.6 billion in a low interest loan. The money was earmarked for payroll support. In return, the U.S. Treasury received warrants to purchase up to 6.5 million shares of DAL stock at a strike price of $24.39 and a five-year maturity. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE In other words, the CARES Act provided money for airlines to stay solvent for the short term, but it came with strings attached, and investors were ultimately unconvinced that would be sufficient for the industry’s long term survival. After gaining 48% in the days leading up to the CARES Act, DAL gave most of that back in the week following its passage.

16,Moderna's vaccine results helped add more than $5 billion to the 'big 4' airlines' market values | Markets Insider,. Moderna's vaccine results helped add more than $5 billion to the 'big 4' airlines' market values. SHARE THIS POST.,"   The Late Late Show with James Corden  Investors appeared to celebrate an American drugmaker's progress toward creating a coronavirus vaccine by adding more than $5 billion to the market capitalizations of the ""big four"" US airlines on Monday. The drugmaker Moderna reported on Monday that participants in an early vaccine trial showed promising immune responses with minimal side effects. The news fueled hopes that the US economy might open sooner than expected, and American Airlines stock rose 9% on the news, with Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines stock up by about 13% and United Airlines stock up 21%. Their combined market caps rose by about 14% to $41 billion.  Despite those gains, Southwest's stock is still down just over 50% this year, with American and Delta down about 63% and 66% and United down by more than 73%. Read more: Small companies are the biggest post-coronavirus battleground on Wall Street. 4 of the world's best fund managers share their strategies for the space — and the single stocks they love. Those declines reflect the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the airline industry. Travel restrictions and transmission fears have almost eliminated demand for flights, sending passenger numbers down more than 90% and forcing carriers to cut routes and leave more than half of the passenger planes in the US sitting idle. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said this month that the airline burned nearly $1 billion in cash in April and warned it would have to ""dramatically downsize"" unless conditions improved. Boeing CEO David Calhoun said it was ""most likely"" that a major carrier would fail later this year.

Warren Buffett struck a similar tone at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting this month.

18,Is Warren Buffett Wrong About Selling Airlines?,. . . . . . . . Is Warren Buffett Wrong About Selling Airlines?. Buffett quits airline sector. The,"      Adam Othman | May 18, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) was already having a bad enough year before the pandemic hit. Just a few weeks ago, shares of the Air Canada stock fell a further 30%. At writing, the stock is down by 70.78% from its January 2020 peak. The stock has been volatile in the recent past, but the pandemic has decimated the stock to terrifying lows. To add to its woes, Warren Buffett recently began letting go of his investments in the aerospace sector. Warren Buffett’s bearish stance on aerospace stocks might be interpreted as a sign for many Canadian investors to ditch the Air Canada stock. Economies have ground to a halt, and governments around the world have closed their borders. The air traffic for AC and its peers has fallen by almost 90% within a month alone. At writing, the AC stock is trading for just $15.22 per share. The question is: Should you follow Warren Buffett and ditch the airline stock, or could he be wrong to be fearful of airlines right now? Warren Buffett broke his silence earlier in May when he announced that he made a mistake investing in the airline sector. Berkshire Hathaway recently sold off its entire holdings in the top airline companies like Southwest Airlines, United Airlines Holdings, American Airlines Group, and Delta Air. With his stance on airline stocks, could the Oracle of Omaha be expecting further losses for Air Canada shareholders? Airlines are worst-hit during recessions, and it is an industry that burns through billions of dollars each day. However, it is not impossible for airlines to recover. Unlike the aerospace sector in America, Air Canada enjoys a less cluttered space in this sector of our economy which means it enjoys a wider economic moat compared to its American counterparts. While there is significant risk involved in sticking with Air Canada, investors can bet on a recovery. I am not simply talking about a rally due to relief efforts; a complete recovery after a return to normal operations is indeed possible. The world won’t be the same once the pandemic ends, but air travel can’t stop forever, and Canadians will fly again. When they do start flying, Air Canada will likely be the carrier. Despite all the risks associated with investing in the stock right now, Air Canada does","May 18, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/05/18/is-warren-buffett-wrong-about-selling-airlines/
