1,Stocks will rally to new highs despite trade tensions: Jeff Saut,"Stocks will rally to new highs no matter what happens with trade, market bull Jeff Saut predicts. MORE IN TRADING"," Wall Street bull Jeffrey Saut predicts the market will stabilize by mid-June despite growing trade tensions with China and Mexico. But first, he expects investors will have to get through a cruel couple of weeks. “Our models... are saying we ought to be chop around and flop around until mid-June,” the Capital Wealth Planning chief investment strategist and portfolio manager said Friday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” Saut, known for his basket of proprietary indicators, has been on Wall Street for almost a half century. He acknowledges it has been a particularly challenging market to navigate, quipping in his Friday note “Emotionally, I may have to throw in the towel and capitulate.” The major indexes are coming off their worst month of the year. Plus, the Dow just logged its first six week losing streak since 2011. However, Saut contends the discouraging statistics don’t suggest gains are doomed for the rest of the year.   “The market ought to have enough internal energy to gather itself back up and go to new all-time highs,” he said. Saut is convinced market and economic fundamentals are solid, and they should drive the to 3,000 by year-end, a 9% gain from Friday’s close. According to Saut, selling stocks now would be a mistake. Instead, he’d be looking for bargains and putting cash back to work. “The economy is actually much better than people think,” Saut said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

2,Customers Still Love Alaska Airlines More Than Delta | The Motley Fool,Customers Still Love Alaska Airlines More Than Delta. J.D. Power just named the West Coast-focused airline the best traditional carrier,"   Over the past decade, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has made operational excellence a top priority, with the goal of boosting customer satisfaction. The carrier has succeeded in becoming one of the most reliable airlines in the world. Meanwhile, Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) has struggled to integrate Virgin America -- a smaller rival it acquired in late 2016 -- into its core Alaska Airlines brand without alienating customers or allowing reliability to slip. Based on some objective customer experience metrics, Delta is now a better airline than Alaska. Nevertheless, that's not how travelers see things. In the recently released J.D. Power 2019 North America Airline Satisfaction Study, Alaska Airlines won for the 12th consecutive year in the ""traditional carrier"" segment. Moreover, it actually widened its lead over Delta. ALASKA AIRLINES JUST WON ITS 12TH CONSECUTIVE J.D. POWER AWARD. IMAGE SOURCE: ALASKA AIRLINES. Over the past decade, Delta has invested heavily in equipment and processes to ensure that customers (and their bags) arrive at their destinations on time. It has gained recognition for its efforts in the annual Airline Quality Rating (AQR) report, which ranks airlines based on the rate of involuntary denied boardings, on-time performance, the frequency with which baggage is lost or damaged, and the number of official complaints to the Department of Transportation. In the 2017 AQR report, Delta nearly took the top spot, coming in just behind Alaska Airlines. The margin separating the two rivals narrowed further in the 2018 report, with Alaska winning by a hair. Delta Air Lines finally broke through in the 2019 report. The company was in the top third of the industry for all four metrics covered by the AQR study and led the way in terms of avoiding ""bumping"" customers from flights. Alaska Airlines didn't come close to matching Delta's performance, instead tumbling three spots to No. 4 in the industry. DELTA OFFERS BETTER SERVICE THAN ALASKA AIRLINES ACCORDING TO MANY OBJECTIVE METRICS. IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. Whereas the AQR report scores airlines based on objective metrics, J.D. Power's annual airline satisfaction study is based on surveys of thousands of air travelers. That said, there are clear links between the four metrics tracked in the AQR study and customer satisfaction.

Messamore | Email | Leave a comment By CCN.com: President Trump’s shock announcement that he would impose tariffs on all Mexican imports rocked the stock market last week, but the White House-induced volatility creates the perfect storm for investors to make a killing by aggressively shorting several Mexico-linked companies. Here are three of your best bets: Constellation Brands, which makes popular Mexican beers like Corona and Modelo, is a prime target for short-sellers who believe Trump will follow through on his threats to hike tariffs as high as 25% on Mexican imports. On Friday, the company’s stock had its bloodiest single-day loss since January, spilling 6% of its market value on the Mexico tariff announcement. https://twitter.com/Market_Screener/status/1134524475544879109 An analyst at Morgan Stanley says the company imports 75% of its beer offerings from Mexico and estimates its profits will go flat by as much as 19% when the full 25% Mexico tariff kicks in this October. That will make for some bitter beer – and some intoxicated short sellers. Similar stocks to short: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Calavo Growers (CVGW) Royal Dutch Shell stock fell just 0.61% in trading Friday, but expect the worst to come. That’s because this oil and gasoline titan is the largest U.S. importer of crude oil from Mexico. Shorting this stock is a good hedge against financial losses to tariffs on Mexican imports. Moreover, it’s a hedge against recession on the horizon as Trump’s global trade war heats up.

7,US-China trade war cuts forecasts for airlines | Financial Times,Cookies on FT Sites. Latest on Airlines. US-China trade war cuts forecasts for airlines. Recommended. . Latest on Airlines. Follow,"STEER FROM CRISIS TO
RECOVERY WITH THE FT Robin Wigglesworth in New York Renewed global trade tensions have led the airline industry’s top trade body to sharply downgrade its profit forecast for the year, underscoring the mushrooming impact of President Donald Trump’s trade war with China.  The International Air Transport Association, which represents about 290 airlines that account for more than 80 per cent of all air traffic, on Sunday cut its forecast for the industry’s overall profits this year to $28bn. That is down from the previous forecast in December of $35.5bn, and would represent a 7 per cent decline from 2018.  “Weakening of global trade is likely to continue as the US-China trade war intensifies,” said Alexandre de Juniac, Iata’s director-general and chief executive officer. “This primarily impacts the cargo business, but passenger traffic could also be impacted as tensions rise. Airlines will still turn a profit this year, but there is no easy money to be made.” Financial markets and business executives were already reeling from the tensions with China that flared up again at the beginning of May, and Mr Trump’s threat last week to impose tariffs on Mexico has exacerbated concerns that global trade is once again coming under pressure.  Car manufacturers and other companies with complex international supply chains have come under particular strain, but the airline industry would also feel the heat, according to Mr de Juniac.  “Aviation needs borders that are open to people and to trade. Nobody wins from trade wars, protectionist policies or isolationist agendas. But everybody benefits from growing connectivity. A more inclusive globalisation must be the way forward,” he said in the statement. The airline industry is also coming under pressure from “rising costs right across the board”, such as mounting fuel costs, wage pressures and more expensive infrastructure. As a result, overall costs are expected to expand by 7.4 per cent this year, crimping net margins to 3.2 per cent and lowering the profit-per-passenger from $6.85 in 2018 to $6.12, Iata estimates.  After a turbulent 2018 the Bloomberg World Airlines Index bounced back with a 15 per cent gain between January and mid-April, but the escalating trade war and concerns over the health of the global economy has sent the gauge down by more than 12 per cent in May.  Chinese airlines are among the biggest decliners, but the shares of Air","Jun 2, 2019",https://www.ft.com/content/3a9c0854-8552-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2

The International Air","Global airline industry is expected to rake in a profit of USD 28 billion this year, much lower than the earlier forecast of USD 35.5 billion, IATA said Sunday, as rising fuel prices and weakening world trade are adversely impacting the business environment. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a grouping of around 290 airlines, also said that overall costs are expected to grow by 7.4 per cent, outpacing a 6.5 per cent rise in revenues. Further, profit per passenger would decline to USD 6.12 in 2019 from USD 6.85 last year. Revising down its forecast, the IATA said the global air transport industry is projected to post a profit of USD 28 billion in 2019 compared to USD 35.5 billion estimated in December 2018. “The business environment for airlines has deteriorated with rising fuel prices and a substantial weakening of world trade,” the grouping said. According to IATA, the airlines’ fuel bill is projected to rise to USD 206 billion, which will represent 25 per cent of average operating costs. “Jet fuel prices have risen with oil prices and we base our forecast on an average jet price of USD 87.5 per barrel next year, and USD 70 per barrel for the brent crude oil price,” it noted. The earlier fall from the peaks of 2018 was driven by an over-supply of crude oil, partly from shale oil production in the US. But, sanctions on Iran’s oil exports and limited spare capacity in OPEC caused oil prices to rise back above to USD 70 billion. IATA Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said 2019 would be the tenth consecutive year in the black for the airline industry but margins are being squeezed by rising costs, including those related to labour, fuel and infrastructure. Stiff competition among airlines keeps yields from rising and weakening of global trade is likely to continue as the US-China trade war intensifies, he added. “We expect 1 per cent of the GDP to be spent on air transport in 2019, totalling USD 899 billion,” IATA said in a report. However, it said that consumers would see a substantial increase in the value they derive from air transport in 2019. “The average return fare (before surcharges and tax) of USD 317 in 2019 is forecast to be 61 per cent lower than in 1998, after adjusting for inflation,” the report said.

10,1 Stock to Buy If You Care About the Environment - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . 1 Stock to Buy If You Care About the Environment. Go clean,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | June 2, 2019 | More on: AQN BEP AQN BEP.UN The technology stocks, erstwhile stock market leaders, are besieged by extreme volatility lately and the ongoing trade disputes and the prospects of a slowdown in economic growth compound the uncertainty. Investors are now moving to safer grounds in search of environmental friendly and “greener” pastures. Independent power producers with a portfolio of non-regulated renewable and clean energy power generation facilities are seen as worthy replacements (with better earning potentials) to tech stocks.  Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (TSX:AQN)(NYSE:AQN) and Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (TSX:BEP.UN)(NYSE:BEP) are suddenly in the limelight. Aside from being defensive stocks, the dividend yields are among the highest. Thus, both are must-buys in uneasy times.  Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. is a mighty name in the renewable energy sector. Generous passive income awaits prospective investors. About 75% of company earnings are derived from regulated utilities and 25% come from renewable power under long-term contracts. Algonquin owns massive renewable power assets in Canada and the U.S. At present, the combined generating capacity of their own and operate hydroelectric, wind, solar, and thermal facilities is approximately 1.5 gigawatts and growing. The dividend yield of 4.47% is very appetizing, and with more renewable energy projects in the pipeline, a 10% yearly increase is a strong possibility. The average net income for the last three years is $85 million. While Algonquin’s market cap is only $7.8 billion, it can deliver better returns than large-cap stocks and beat small-cap stocks handily. Analysts find that company’s debt level as too high, but AQN’s earnings after interest and tax are three times its net interest payments. That’s the mark a financially sound company. Another green energy stock that’s getting so much attention these days is Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. The company is regarded as one of the leaders in the renewable energy sector. It’s a blue chip, high-quality stock in terms of dividend yield. Who wouldn’t be charmed by a 6.5% dividend yield? The business outlook is exceedingly bright for Brookfield, as several green energy power projects will soon deliver the goods. Shareholders will be delighted to know that the estimated earnings growth this year is 77%, but will taper off to about 47.8% in 2020. For this quarter, growth estimate is 1,500%.

11,World's longest flight to be less comfortable than expected - BNN Bloomberg,. BNN. PURSUITS. PURSUITS. Company News. News Wire. World's longest flight to be less comfortable than expected. . Pursuits. ,"    Jun 2, 2019  Angus Whitley, Bloomberg News Flights half way around the globe are set to be even less comfortable than expected -- that’s if the marathon 20-hour non-stop services from Sydney to London get off the ground at all. Qantas Airways Ltd. has ditched the notion of rolling out bunks, beds, a gym or even a creche for passengers enduring the world’s longest commercial flight. Instead, they’ll be given a space to have a stretch and a drink of water, Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said Monday in Seoul. The more spartan comfort levels underscore Qantas’s challenge as it tries to break through what it calls aviation’s last frontier. There are other barriers, too: While Joyce said the planes proposed by Boeing Co. and Airbus SE for the ultra long-haul flights can make the distance, neither can carry the weight that Qantas initially targeted. Speaking to reporters in Seoul at the annual gathering of airline bosses, Joyce said he still needs Qantas pilots to agree to the longer working hours the ultra-long flights will entail. “There are a significant number of hurdles to overcome but we think we can make this work,” he said. “There’s still not full payload on each aircraft, but there’s enough we think to make it commercially viable if the other parts of the business case get there.” Deadline Looms Qantas expects to receive final aircraft proposals from Boeing and Airbus by August. That will include the price of the plane, as well as guarantees on fuel efficiency, maintenance costs and reliability. Joyce said he’ll order the jets by year-end if he decides to push ahead with the flights, which are known at Qantas as Project Sunrise. Qantas has said it’s sizing up the long-range Airbus A350 against Boeing’s 777X. Boeing or Airbus would deliver the aircraft in 2022 and the first flights would be in 2023, he said. Still, there’s little margin for error. For example, the Sydney-London service won’t be able to carry extra freight, Joyce said. Direct flights to New York from Sydney are more achievable, he said. Qantas is trying to roll out a network of super-long direct services connecting Australia’s eastern seaboard with South America, South Africa and North America as rising oil prices squeeze profit margins. Even after promoting Project Sunrise for years, Joyce said he’d be ruthless. “We will kill the project”","Jun 2, 2019",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/world-s-longest-flight-to-be-even-less-comfortable-than-expected-1.1267470

Terms apply to the offers listed on this page. For an explanation of our Advertising Policy, visit this page. It can be easy to slip into the mindset of thinking of your points and miles as simply being another type of money. The similarities are overwhelming — we get some of our favorite points from the same banks where we deposit our paychecks, and we use language like “currency” to describe different kinds of points and miles. However, there’s one very important distinction that needs to be near the front of your mind: Unlike most true currencies, which have the potential for appreciation if invested well, your points and miles are guaranteed to lose value in the long run, and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. Award travel isn’t a contest; there’s no prize for having the most points. Instead, it’s a game that’s best played as much or as little as needed to satisfy your own personal travel needs. In this post, I’ll explain why routinely carrying large balances of points and miles — with no plan to use them — is a bad investment strategy so you can avoid setting yourself up for disappointment, heartache and a possible loss in net (loyalty) worth. In the last few years, we’ve seen a number of painful devaluations of some of our favorite points programs. This has even hit transferable point programs. The general mantra is that transferable points like Chase Ultimate Rewards are slightly more insulated from devaluations than an individual frequent flyer program is. Even if one of Chase’s partners is devalued, plenty of other options will remain. However, Chase dropped Korean Air as a transfer partner last year. At only 80,000 SKYPASS miles each way, Korean is one of the cheapest ways to book first class awards between the US and Asia, and availability on the carrier’s A380s and 747-8s is often excellent. Removing this easy pathway to luxurious, first-class flights was a big hit to the Ultimate Rewards suite of transfer partners. Then earlier this year, United MileagePlus — one of Chase’s strongest transfer partners — announced a switch to dynamic award pricing for its flights beginning on November 15.

Small-caps and large-caps are wildly popular among investors, however, mid-cap stocks, such as Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L), with a market capitalization of S$11b, rarely draw their attention from the investing community. However, generally ignored mid-caps have historically delivered better risk adjusted returns than both of those groups. Today we will look at C6L’s financial liquidity and debt levels, which are strong indicators for whether the company can weather economic downturns or fund strategic acquisitions for future growth. Remember this is a very top-level look that focuses exclusively on financial health, so I recommend a deeper analysis into C6L here. Check out our latest analysis for Singapore Airlines Over the past year, C6L has ramped up its debt from S$3.1b to S$6.7b , which accounts for long term debt. With this rise in debt, the current cash and short-term investment levels stands at S$3.2b , ready to be used for running the business. On top of this, C6L has produced cash from operations of S$2.8b over the same time period, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 42%, indicating that C6L’s debt is appropriately covered by operating cash. At the current liabilities level of S$7.4b, it appears that the company arguably has a rather low level of current assets relative its obligations, with the current ratio last standing at 0.75x. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. With debt reaching 49% of equity, C6L may be thought of as relatively highly levered. This is not uncommon for a mid-cap company given that debt tends to be lower-cost and at times, more accessible. We can test if C6L’s debt levels are sustainable by measuring interest payments against earnings of a company. Ideally, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) should cover net interest by at least three times. For C6L, the ratio of 15.01x suggests that interest is comfortably covered, which means that debtors may be willing to loan the company","Jun 2, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-singapore-airlines-limiteds-sgx-234742163.html

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Polish inventor and entrepreneur Jerzy Wysocki catches a brown plate -- still warm -- as it drops out of a machine and he begins to eat the crunchy, fibrous tableware. ""A pork chop will always be more delicious on this wheat bran plate than on plastic,"" says Wysocki with a big grin at the Biotrem factory in Zambrow in northeast Poland. Taking a bite, the plate does not have much of a flavour. It calls to mind dry cereal flakes or maybe what you would imagine cardboard to taste like. But Wysocki says what matters is the tableware is biodegradable. The sexagenarian invented the plate some 15 years ago, and today Biotrem makes around 15 million of them a year. That figure could soon skyrocket thanks to a decision by the European Union to ban plastic plates and cutlery starting in 2021. A son and grandson of millers, Wysocki got the idea for the tableware when he was looking to use up the leftovers of flour production, which take up a lot of space. But he says he is also driven by the desire to help a good cause, ""because the amount of rubbish that pollutes oceans is huge and frightening."" ""To make the plates, we only use wheat bran, which we compress at a precise pressure point and temperature, using a machine made specifically for that purpose,"" he explains. - Eco-conscious clients - Biotrem CEO Malgorzata Then acknowledges, of course, that at 15 euro cents (17 US cents) a pop or 20 percent more for exports, wheat bran plates are more expensive than their plastic counterparts. But ""the current price of plastic doesn't factor in the environmental cost, that of recycling and marine pollution,"" she adds. At first, the company targeted clients who were environmentally inclined as well as restaurants and hotels that wanted to offer something original. ""Now, with the measures taken by the EU, even clients who are uninformed about the environment are forced to take an interest in biodegradable products,"" Then said.

With Jet Airways grounded, opportunities narrowing in Indian market: Star Alliance. Big market."," MORE Jeffrey Goh, CEO Star Alliance   -  PTI  India is a big aviation market and Air India provides the important domestic network but opportunities in the market are narrowing with Jet Airways being non-operational, Star Alliance CEO Jeffrey Goh said on Sunday. The Star Alliance is a grouping of 28 airlines, including Air India, which became a member in July 2014.

I think certainly to that degree possible, it will help (that)... Air India will have higher capacity and better yields because there is less capacity in the market,” he said. Full service carrier Jet Airways, which had a significant number of international flights, temporarily suspended operations in April after running out of cash. To a query on whether there could be a second Indian carrier such as low-cost carrier IndiGo as a Star Alliance member, Goh said the grouping is positioned for having a full member as well as a connecting partner model. “We also have the ability to integrate less traditional airlines whether they are hybrid, regional or low-cost airlines. We are positioned to address both the situations. We are not closed for business, whether an airline in India is interested in full membership or connecting partner model. It is more a question of value proposition that you can bring to the network,” he said. Talking on the sidelines of an IATA (International Air Transport Association) event here, he stressed that an airline should prove its business case if it has to be a member or connecting partner. IndiGo is India’s largest domestic airline with a market share of nearly 50 per cent. Low-cost carrier SpiceJet’s Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh was elected to the board of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), less than three months after the airline joined the global grouping.

The department is expected to issue an order tentatively approving the joint business agreement and tentatively granting antitrust immunity, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The order, which is expected as early as Monday and would be subject to public comment, is likely to include conditions to protect competition and allow for government oversight of the venture, the sources added. A department spokesman declined to comment on the matter. The application by American and Qantas for a joint venture covering the United States, Australia and New Zealand was tentatively rejected in November 2016 by former President Barack Obama’s administration amid opposition from rival carriers Hawaiian Airlines Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp. Regulators in Australia and New Zealand approved the first application for the joint venture before it was rejected by the U.S. Transportation Department. American Airlines spokeswoman Shannon Gilson said on Sunday the airline feels “we have made a compelling case about the benefits of the joint business for customers, and there was no opposition raised to our proposal. We’re hopeful the Qantas joint business will be approved.” American and Qantas in February 2018 made a second attempt to gain U.S. regulatory permission under President Donald Trump’s administration for a venture that would let them coordinate prices and schedules, threatening to cancel services if it was rejected and arguing it could “unlock” up to $310 million annually in consumer benefits. The revised application made significant changes including removing a provision that would have barred either carrier from codesharing with other carriers. Codesharing is a arrangement between airlines in which two or more carriers publish and advertise a single flight under their own airline number. The airlines argued in their 2018 application that the venture would lead to a reduction in fares and higher capacity as a “more viable third competitor” and require other carriers to respond with improvements to quality, schedules and price. Qantas said last year the joint venture would allow the two airlines to “significantly improve service” and “stimulate demand”. The airlines said the agreement could generate up to 180,000 new trips between the United","Jun 2, 2019",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-airlines-american-qantas-exclusiv-idUSKCN1T4041
19,Technology Archives - Towards Better Questions,GOOD BUTTONS TO CLICK:. Category: Technology. Why The AV Revolution Will Give Southwest Airlines No LUV. The Five Laws of,"Towards Better Questions Mostly tech, sometimes random, always interesting. Question: Why won’t you want to own regional airline stocks in the future?  Better Question: Why would you ever fly from Chicago to New York again?  If I were the CEO of Southwest I’d be terrified of the dawn of self-driving cars.  The average Southwest flight is 757 miles and takes roughly 2 hours.   Aviation contributes 5% of global emissions, making a growing share of consumers unhappy about flying.  I predict that as self-driving vehicles take over, most people will opt to drive to their destination while they sleep.    Assume an overnight AV trip takes 12 hours, including an hour to recharge and take occasional breaks.  The current record for a Tesla is 670 miles on a single charge, which can be expected to increase as battery efficiency improves, making driving 11 hours feasible.  An AV going 70 mph (the current interstate speed limit) you could easily travel 770 miles overnight. With no need for controls, and the engine replaced by small electric motors, chairs will be able to recline into lie-flat beds.  Imagine relaxing in business class…in the backseat of your own car.  In the future, should you wish to travel from Chicago to New York you’ll have a choice.  Option A: Drive to the airport, check in, wait in security lines with hundreds of other people, experience a delay, eat unhealthy food, experience another delay, all while contemplating why bottled water costs 3x the normal price, and then buying it anyway.   OR… Option B: Get in your AV, stretch out, relax, read, work and then lie flat to sleep, only waking up when your car announces that you’ve arrived at your destination.  Hmm. I’m pretty sure I’ll grab my book, reusable water bottle, laptop and pillow, and head for my AV.  How far could you travel in your sleep?  Consider the following:   Once AV’s are a reality, a traveler starting in San Francisco could go anywhere in the green circle. Start in New York and reach any spot in blue. Begin in Austin and travel to any place in purple radius.   AV travel will make the most of your valuable time.
