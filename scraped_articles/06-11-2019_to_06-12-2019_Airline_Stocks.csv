You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work, and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. “We’re all going on a summer holiday, no more working for a week or two”. Cliff Richard first sang these words in 1963, a time when families would save up all year for an annual getaway. In the 60s most people would take what we now call a ‘staycation’, as few could afford the luxury of a cruise or flight to a sunny destination. Nowadays, however, jetting off to somewhere new – a city, beach or jungle – can be done at any time of the year and, thanks to low-cost airlines, doesn’t have to break the bank. Irish airline Ryanair was one of the first to launch into the low-cost space in 1984, followed almost a decade later by the infamous orange-branded Easyjet. Together, the airlines have a combined fleet size of more than 700 aircraft, dominating some of the UK’s largest airports, and transport tourists to almost 400 destinations. We have all, at some point, lined the pockets of Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and Michael O’Leary, through ticket sales and in-flight extras, but an investment in one of these businesses could potentially boost the returns of your portfolio, too. INVEST IN STOCKS NOW
Your capital is at risk. Ryanair listed on the stock exchange in 1997 and since then its share price has soared more than 1,050%. Easyjet, meanwhile, IPO’d in 2000 and has seen its share price grow 220%. But while Mr O’Leary’s Irish airline is still on the up, Easyjet’s share price has been suffering. In the past 12 months, it has dropped almost 50% and year to date (June 7), it has fallen 17.4%. Easyjet is now teetering on the edge of relegation out of the UK100, reserved only for blue chip companies. But for thrill-seeking investors – or even those that just like to place their cash with a stock they think has the potential to offer future value – the orange-airline may well be just what they were looking for. Beyond the brand, Easyjet has a strong, cash-rich balance sheet that puts it in a good position amid the uncertainty surrounding Brexit,","Jun 12, 2019",https://www.etoro.com/news-and-analysis/market-insights/stocks-in-flight/
1,"Three financial stocks to buy as big banks rally, investors say","Three financial stocks to buy as big banks rally, investors say. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Financials are surging for the second day in a row, coming back from their deep May sell-off. The rally is just getting started, said Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, who upgraded the diversified financials industry group over the weekend. “This is a play on cyclicals in general,” Wald said Monday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “These oversold conditions for interest rates, this is dry powder for cyclicals. Speaking in terms of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, the yield is currently over 60 basis points below its 200-day moving average — extremely stretched on the downside.” The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield recently reached its most oversold condition since January 2015, Wald said. The benchmark bond yield has fallen from 2.42% to 2.14% in the past three weeks. The move higher again should benefit high-beta stocks, he said, particularly the financials which tend to rise when the yield curve steepens. Longer-term bonds with higher yields than shorter-term bonds expand a bank’s profitability. Wald is watching two of those stocks, in particular. “The first one is S&P Global. The stock has had a fresh breakout above its 2018 high point at $215, typically the breakout point becomes support and on the upside we think that breakout measures to $260,” he said.  “Second name, consumer finance company American Express. Here’s a stock that broke above 2018 resistance ahead of the market, now more recently getting above its May peak ahead of the market. Again, a sign of relative strength, a sign of leadership. These are names we expect continue to carry the market higher,” Wald said.  Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, sees a similar set-up as bond yields move back up. “I think 2.10% [on the 10-year] was a near-term bottom and as the 10-year comes back up and goes to 2.50%, it’s going to be a natural re-steepening of the yield curve and I don’t think you really need to be that picky. Everything I think is going to go up and within that, I actually like J.P. Morgan,” Schlossberg said during the same segment. J.P. Morgan has outperformed the XLF financial ETF over the past three months, gaining 6% compared with the gain of 5% for the financials. The big bank is also up 5% this month. “It’s done really, really well even in this difficult environment and I think if we","Jun 11, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/three-financials-stocks-to-buy-as-big-banks-rally-investors-say.html

Every company faces headwinds at some point..,"Getty Images Every company faces headwinds at some point. Even the bluest of blue-chip stocks must tackle a serious threat from time to time. Dangers can come from anywhere. They can be industrial accidents such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that cost BP plc (BP) nearly $65 billion in legal fees, settlements and cleanup costs as of 2018. There are technological squabbles, such as Apple’s (AAPL) 2017 patent infringement lawsuit settlement with Nokia, which forced the iPhone maker to pay $2 billion upfront as well as ongoing royalties from iPhone sales. Pfizer (PFE) was weighed down considerably in 2011 as it was about to lose market exclusivity on its blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor – this so-called patent cliff is a frequent headwind for pharma stocks. Some blue chips, such as Apple and Pfizer, take the hit and keep on chugging. Others, like BP, take much longer to recover – if they ever do. You can get some insight into potential headwinds by reading the “Risk Factors” section of each company’s annual 10-K filing. Companies are required to list, by order of importance, the most significant risks challenging future profits or stock performance. Some risks apply to the entire economy, some to that particular industry and a few are unique to that company. Here are 13 blue-chip stocks that currently are navigating their way around a landmine or two. This isn’t necessarily a list of stocks to sell, however. Great companies can often overcome major setbacks, and many of these companies are working toward that. But retirees need to be especially aware of forces that threaten substantial shorter-term losses. And even the most ardent bull should acknowledge and understand significant risks – even if they merely set a stock up for a dip-buying situation. 1 of 13 Getty Images Facebook also faces big fines from the European Union under new privacy laws.

4,NSE to remove Jet Airways from daily trading from 28 June,NSE to remove Jet Airways from daily trading from 28 June. . ,"  MUMBAI : The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) said on Wednesday that shares of Jet Airways (India) Ltd will be removed from daily trading of futures and options effective 28 June, citing the embattled carrier’s failure to respond to queries about persisting rumours in the market. Shares of the Mumbai-based carrier fell 1.38% on Wednesday to ₹106.3 on the BSE, compared with a 0.48% decline in the benchmark Sensex. The company’s shares have shed nearly 71% in a year, underperforming the Sensex’s 11.39% gain. Jet Airways has deferred interest payments to banks and dues to fuel suppliers, oil marketing companies, and aircraft lessors. As a result, lessors of the airline had grounded most of its 119 planes. The debt-ridden carrier has also not paid some employees since March. Jet Airways spent ₹781.19 crore as remuneration for its employees during the October-December 2018 quarter. NSE also cited the company’s failure to submit financial results for the year ended 31 March, as well as observations made by its auditor, as reasons for its decision. Several people from the top management and board of directors of the carrier, which has not operated a flight since 17 April, have left the company in the past few months, following the departure of founder and chairman Naresh Goyal in March. Lenders to Jet Airways, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), are seeking investors to recover their dues. The airline’s total liability, including unpaid salaries and vendor dues, is nearly ₹15,000 crore. If all else fails, Jet Airways may be referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). However, under bankruptcy resolution, lenders may recover only a fraction of the ₹8,400 crore the airline owes them. Mint reported on Tuesday that the Hinduja Group and Etihad Airways PJSC may not proceed with plans to resurrect the airline, dealing a severe blow to rescue efforts. The pilots union of Jet Airways will file a plea against the grounded airline at the NCLT for non-payment of salaries and not providing a provision for gratuity payment to its staff, two senior members of the union said on Tuesday . The union, the National Aviators Guild (NAG), counted about 1,100 of the airline’s 1,600 pilots as its members before the grounding of the carrier.

6,Business Class On A Budget: La Compagnie Flights To France,MORE FROM FORBES. Business Class On A Budget: La Compagnie Flights To France. What Does It Mean That America Is,"La Compagnie new Airbus A321neo Planning a trip to France this summer, but leery of jam-packed planes and steerage-class seating? La Compagnie, the all-business class airline celebrating its 5th birthday this year, might be an alternative. In fact, if you book by June 13, the company is offering round-trip flights from New York/Newark to Paris for as low as $1,000. Yes, business class. All-business class airlines are not new, but they’re not all that common either. A number were started in the first decade of this century, but by 2009, Eos Airlines, MAXjet Airways, SilverJet and L'Avion all ceased operation, as oil prices hit $100 a barrel.  (Full disclosure: I own stock in Jet Blue, American Airline and Southwest.) While all-Business Class has previously failed, based on its five-year staying power, La Compagnie may be onto something. That can be boiled down to two facts. PROMOTED To reach the first group, there is at least one all-business class “airline within an airline,” British Airways’ rather bizarre flight from the UK to NY. BA1, or Club World London City, consists of a tiny 32-seat, business class-only Airbus A318. Flights include a short take-off from London City Airport near that city’s docks and a stop to refuel in Ireland while passengers pass through US customs. No such restrictions appear to hamper La Compagnie. The company currently flies two Boeing 757s and a new Airbus A321neo non-stop to two destinations, Paris and Nice, from New York/Newark (EWR). The flight to Paris Orly Airport takes about 7 hours non-stop; the flight to Nice about 7 ½ hours. Both the 757s and the A321 are outfitted as all-business class aircraft. The 757s have 74 lie-flat seats, while the A321neo has 76. A second A321neo is expected to join the fleet in September, with one of the 757s being retired. Interior of La Compagnie A321neo. Photocredit: Christophe Dauphin About 60% of La Compagnie’s customers are business travelers, 40% are leisure, an area growing particularly on the new Nice route. Jean-Charles Perino, Co-Founder of La Compagnie, says, “It’s about 80% Americans; a lot of Americans who go to Nice or the Cote D’Azure own apartments there.” About 60% of flights are booked from the La Compagnie website, the other 40% by corporate travel departments and travel agencies.

Shares of Jet, once the biggest private airline in India, have more than halved since the airline shut down its operations in April after its lenders refused to bail it out. Jet's securities will now be moved to the trade for trade segment with effect from June 28 as a ""preventive surveillance measure"", from the current rolling segment, which allows daily trading, the stock exchange said in a circular. ""There are concerns with regard to continuity of flow of information about the company which is very vital for the appropriate price discovery in the scrip,"" NSE said, adding that trading in the stock may not reflect the actual status of the company.

A part of the London-based AdiGroup, AdiGro Aviation earlier offered to invest Rs 2,500 crore for 24.9 percent stake in Jet Airways, as a part of the talks that involved Etihad Airways and Hinduja Group to revive the Indian airline. Jet Airways suspended its operations on April 17. ""We are interested but can't do it alone. We need an operator to operationally turn around the company,"" AdiGroup founder Sanjay Viswanathan told Moneycontrol. ""Etihad is the linchpin in this. We are waiting to hear from it,"" added Viswanathan. He, however, added that if Etihad did not get involved, AdiGro would explore opportunities with other operators. ""There are three operators who are willing to partner us,"" he said. While reiterating that time is of essence, Viswanathan said, ""My cheque is ready. I am happy if the banks take even 75 percent haircut, instead of 85-90 percent."" The haircut by banks on Jet Airways’ debt of over Rs 8,000 crore has been one of the hurdles in the talks to revive the airline. Sources told Moneycontrol that both Etihad Airways and Hinduja Group were hoping for up to 90 percent haircut from banks. But, the lenders, led by State Bank of India, have been reluctant to do so. While there have been indications that the government may have cleared the decks for the lenders to take the haircut, other hurdles remain. One of the biggest right now is of two Jet Airways operational creditors approaching the National Company Law Tribunal to recover dues. The tribunal is hearing the petition on June 13, and its decision either to submit the appeal or not will have a bearing on the bidding process. In a reply to Moneycontrol's query on Tuesday, Etihad Airways said it would continue to work for a possible solution to revive Jet Airways.

11,Alaska Airlines Will Add Another Route at Paine Field | The Motley Fool,Alaska Airlines Will Add Another Route at Paine Field. The Seattle-based airline is refining its flight schedule at its hometown's,"   In March, Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) began operating its first routes at Paine Field: a secondary airport in Everett, Wash., near the airline's hometown of Seattle. Now, with a few months of service under its belt, the carrier is responding to customer requests by adding a new route to Palm Springs, Calif. However, due to the tiny size of Paine Field's terminal, Alaska Airlines can't increase the number of departures it offers at the airport. As a result, this move requires a broader realignment of Alaska's flight schedule there. Alaska Airlines is the No. 1 airline in Seattle, with more than 300 daily departures. That said, it faces a growing challenge from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). While Delta has significantly fewer daily flights from Seattle than Alaska right now, it has a much larger global route network. It flies nonstop from Seattle to numerous destinations in Europe and Asia (unlike Alaska Airlines) and offers one-stop service to pretty much everywhere in the U.S. In response to Delta's expansion, Alaska has added extra flights of its own in Seattle. This has contributed to growing congestion at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac). There simply isn't enough gate space to accommodate much more growth there right now. ALASKA AIRLINES' MAIN HUB AT SEA-TAC IS BECOMING EXTREMELY CONGESTED. IMAGE SOURCE: ALASKA AIRLINES. As a result, Alaska Airlines saw the opening of Paine Field to commercial flights earlier this year as a valuable opportunity to improve its position in the greater Puget Sound region. At times, heavy traffic can increase the driving time from Seattle's northern suburbs to Sea-Tac (which is south of the city) to well over an hour. By flying to Paine Field, which is located about 25 miles north of downtown Seattle, Alaska can better serve customers who live in that area. The one complication regarding Paine Field is that the commercial terminal recently built there has just two gates. Alaska Airlines -- one of two carriers to serve the airport -- has the right to operate 18 daily round-trips. That's almost certainly fewer flights than would be supported by demand in the area. Thus, Alaska has had to choose carefully how to utilize its relatively scarce Paine Field slots. Initially, Alaska Airlines served eight destinations from Paine Field: Los Angeles, Portland, Las Vegas, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Phoenix, and Orange County. However, nearly half its schedule consisted of","Jun 12, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/12/alaska-airlines-will-add-another-route-paine-field.aspx

Traders have moved on from the lastest shiny thing, Beyond Meat, to Wednesday’s latest offering. That would be CrowdStrike, a California-based cyber-security firm. CrowdStrike is notable for helping out with investigations into the Sony Pictures and Democratic National Party hacking incidents. Underwriters planned to sell CrowdStrike to the public at $28-$30 per share. High initial demand boosted the offering price to $34. But that was nothing. The stock opened at $63 for an 80% rise from the already elevated offering price. It closed Wednesday’s trading at $58 for a 71% first-day pop. Traders love CrowdStrike’s offering in large part because it is one of the fastest-growing cloud companies around. It currently has a triple-digit annual revenue growth rate. Not everyone is buying CrowdStrike though:  On Monday, Salesforce.com announced a megadeal, buying cloud data visualization firm Tableau for $15.7 billion. This is one of the largest deals ever in the cloud space and has set off a rip-roaring rally for other sector stocks. For years, cloud companies have focused on growth at all costs, often while running large losses. Skeptics doubted this would pay off. But Salesforce has confirmed the business model now. Investors that bought Tableau in 2017 tripled their money. Not surprisingly, scores of cloud stocks are up 10% or more this week following the Tableau deal.

All the pilots from Singapore Airlines, who operate Airbus fleet, are trained in the Airbus Asia Training Centre (AATC) — a joint venture between Singapore Airlines (45 per cent) and Airbus (55 per cent). AATC, located in Singapore, trains about 6,000 pilots every year from 60 different airlines. Depending on the qualifications and experience of the pilot, the training programme at AATC spans between three days and one month. The three training technologies used in AATC include interactive training applications such as Airbus Cockpit Experience (ACE), Airbus Pilot Transition (APT) and Full Flight Simulators (FFS). ACE replicates the airplane’s cockpit either on a laptop or a tablet from which the pilot learns about aircraft systems and procedures, digitally. The APT is a fixed cockpit set-up that gives an idea about the position and functioning of an Airbus cockpit. And FFS simulates the aircraft and the environment in which it flies. It allow pilots to be trained in scenarios, such as take-off, landing, emergency landing and water landing; it may not be possible for pilots to undergo training in a few of these on a real aircraft. Behind Singapore Airlines’ in-flight meal, there’s enormous planning on the quantity and quality of meals, menus and meal specification for each class, raw material requirements, introduction or inventory of kitchen equipment, timely delivery and managing food waste. To meet the meal requirements for flights departing from Singapore, the Airlines has outsourced these catering services to SATS — the chief ground-handling and in-flight catering service provider at Singapore Changi Airport.
