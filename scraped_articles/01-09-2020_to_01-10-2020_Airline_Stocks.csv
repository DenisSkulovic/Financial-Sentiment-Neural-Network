0,Airlines top FTSE on Ryanair boost but retail stocks suffer fresh slide - Citywire,. Airlines top FTSE on Ryanair boost but retail stocks suffer fresh slide. Leave a comment!. Daniel Grote: Goodbye and," Airline stocks have risen to the top of the FTSE 100 after Ryanair (RYA.I) lifted its profit forecast, but a rash of weak updates from retailers have sent their shares lower. British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) was the biggest riser on a flat FTSE 100, up 4.6% at 663.9p on the bullish update from its Irish budget rival. EasyJet (EZJ) was close behind, up 4% at £14.96 while on the FTSE 250, Wizz Air (WIZZ) was up 5.6% at £40.74. Ryanair raised its profit forecast for the year to up to €1.05bn, up from a range of €800m to €900m, sending its shares 7.2% higher. 'The whole airline sector was rising in Ryanair's tailwind after a very encouraging update from the budget carrier,' said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. 'Investors' attention will always be grabbed by a big number and Ryanair has duly delivered, raising the upper end of its full-year profit guidance above the €1 billion mark.' Retail stocks were meanwhile in the red, as the embattled sector came under pressure from a series of weak updates. On the FTSE 250, B&M (BME) was the biggest faller, down 8.4% at 364p as the retailer reporting slowing sales growth in the crucial Christmas quarter. Like-for-like sales rose just 0.3% over the period, down from 3.5% in the previous quarter. 'Today's third quarter sales confirmed the impact of a soft UK pre-election market,' said Numis analyst James Grzinic, who pointed to 'a promotionally competitive backdrop which B&M chose not to join'. Superdry (SDRY) was the heaviest 'small-cap' faller, down 15.3% at 399.8p, after the clothing retailer reported lower-than-expected Christmas sales that could wipe out full-year profits. 'Co-founder Julian Dunkerton's return to Superdry as chief executive is starting to look like a difficult second album rather than an overnight success,' said Mould. 'A dodgy Christmas trading period means there may now be no profit at all in the current financial year. The weak performance was partly blamed on old stock.' On the Alternative Investment Market, Joules (JOUL) tumbled 21.9% to 176.5p as the fashion retailer warned 2020 profits would be significantly below market expectations due to a misallocation of stock over Christmas. 'While we are disappointed to see Joules unable to fulfil the potential from strong Christmas demand, we take some consolation that the demand was there and that this should be a one-off issue that does not","Jan 10, 2020",https://citywire.co.uk/funds-insider/news/airlines-top-ftse-on-ryanair-boost-but-retail-stocks-suffer-fresh-slide/a1311960
1,Airline Stocks: A Smooth or Rocky Road in 2020? • ข่าวหุ้นธุรกิจออนไลน์,วันที่ 20 ธันวาคม 2020. . Airline Stocks: A Smooth or Rocky Road in 2020?. แชร์เรื่องนี้. คำค้น. Copyright © 2020 ข่าวหุ้นธุรกิจออนไลน์.,"/ BREAKING NEWS / Airline Stocks: A Smooth or Rocky Road in 2020? วันที่ 09/01/2020 Is the airlines’ stock in the midst of the profit growth slowdown and less-expectation of investors? Even though a long vacation period had just passed a couple of weeks ago with the high numbers of passengers who traveled by plane, why the airlines’ stocks are in the midst of the profit growth slowdown and less-expectation of investors? The analyst suggests that there are 2 principal factors; first, the primary capital, oil, the price is still high and second, the intense competition of plane ticket discount. Those 2 factors impact investors’ confidence in the entire airline industry. Nok Airlines Public Company Limited (NOK) and Asia Aviation Public Company Limited (AAV) are the most affected by this situation as a consequence of intensive competition. Air Asia, the number one low-cost airline, experienced a net loss of 401 million baht in the first nine-month of 2019 while last year in the same period, Air Asia was satisfied with an earning of 339 million baht. Nok Air, the overall performance was better if compared with the same period of last year, but still faced a net loss of 1,616 million baht. Meanwhile, Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited (BA), classifying its business as boutique airline, confronted the net loss of 131 million baht; conversely, last year Bangkok Airways had net income of 663 million baht.    As Thai Airways International Public Company Limited (THAI) lost its profit continuously with a net loss of 11,119 million baht, increased 4,082 million baht from the previous year.         The analyst has emphasized, judging by airlines’ profit and loss in 2019, that the performance of this year could still be as bad as last year.  Following the turnover of all many airlines, investors have lost their confidence and sold airline stocks, caused the airline’s share price to plunge dramatically. In the last three months, AAV dropped 27.63%, BA fell 22.41% and THAI decreased 24.73%, but NOK dropped only 1.89%.  48/5-6 ชั้น 2 ซ.รุ่งเรือง ถนน รัชดาภิเษก แขวง สามเสนนอก เขต ห้วยขวาง กรุงเทพฯ 10320 Phone: 02-693-4555 E-mai: kaohoon.bu@gmail.com","Jan 9, 2020",https://www.kaohoon.com/content/334816

3,Delta Is Upbeat on High-Tech Changes. These Stocks Could Benefit. | Barron's,"Delta Has Tons of High-Tech Optimism. These Stocks Could Benefit.. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily. Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta","  A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian’s keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show detailed how he wants to completely redefine
the flying experience. The question for investors is what other firms will benefit from Delta’s push into higher-tech flying.  Delta (ticker: DAL) and other airlines, after all, are integrators of technology. Airlines
aren’t typically considered tech companies, but Bastian’s speech didn’t lack for techno-optimism. “What if, instead of taking your bags with you to the airport, they were picked up at your home and transported directly to your hotel,” Bastian asked the assembled crowed in Las Vegas on Tuesday.  Airline travelers would likely go for that. They would welcome almost anything that made flying a less stressful experience. Other things he wants to do include offering free in-flight Wi-Fi, full integration with ride-hailing services such as Lyft (LYFT)—with pickup times adjusted for real-time traffic details—and device-screen mirroring with seat-back displays. Entertainment streaming would start after an app-based check-in; fliers could start their movie in their Lyft. It’s easy to figure out who benefits from ride-hailing integration: Lyft and its larger rival Uber Technologies (UBER). They develop the apps and driver networks that would bring Bastian’s vision to life. The companies could use the help, too. Lyft shares are down about 36% from the $72 initial public offering price, while Uber shares are off about 24% from its $45 IPO price. Uber and Lyft could also benefit from baggage pickup, splitting any fees with the airline. (It’s unlikely baggage services would be free.) “We’re going to get it within the next two years,” Bastian told Cheddar’s Hope King in an interview after the keynote address. “You don’t want me to turn it on quite yet..it will crash the system.” Data transmission requires infrastructure. Honeywell (HON), the industrial conglomerate
, makes the equipment and software that enables services such as free Wi-Fi. The company’s JetWave is a Wi-Fi solution for airlines as well as private aircraft. Delta isn’t a customer, but JetWave is used and offered among international airlines.  Honeywell’s hardware connects to Inmarsat’s GX Aviation service and allows for internet speeds of up to 50 megabits per second.

Share prices, price","Getty Images Never say never, but it's hard to see stocks follow their amazing 2019 returns for a second straight year. S&P 500 stocks sent the index a whopping 29% higher in 2020. That's a big deal. Keep in mind that the market's long-term average annual gain comes to about 7.7%, then factor in the tendency for share performance to revert to the mean, and the odds of another boffo year are slim. Indeed, years in which the S&P 500 rises at least 20% generate an average gain of only 6.6% the following year, according to Bespoke Investment Group. But that doesn't mean investors can't try to replicate 2019's party by seeding their holdings with stocks expected to blow away the broader market. To find stocks primed to outperform, we scoured the S&P 500 for stocks with expected price gains of at least 20% this year. We supplemented that research by limiting ourselves to stocks that are Buy-rated or better by Wall Street analysts, as well as boast promising fundamentals, attractive valuations and other bullish features. Here, then, are 11 of the best S&P 500 stocks you can buy for outsize gains in 2020. Based analysts’ projected price returns, Wall Street expects these names to rally from 20% to more than 35% this year. 1 of 11 Analysts are split on whether shares are a Buy at current levels, with some calling ABMD a ""show-me"" stock until revenue growth re-accelerates.

7,Delta Air Lines Stock Is a Value Investor's Sky-High Dream | InvestorPlace,Delta Air Lines Stock Is a Value Investor’s Sky-High Dream. Value investors seem to really like DAL stock. Even Warren," Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock is the kind of stock that contrarian value investors like. DAL trades at a cheap valuation, but the underlying company fundamentals are very strong.  For example, DAL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings metric of 8.2 times earnings. It also has a 2.8% dividend yield. In other words, investors are getting paid to wait until Delta Air Lines stock rises to a higher valuation. In fact, over the past five years, dividends have grown at a rate of 38% annually, according to Seeking Alpha. And over the past three years, payouts grew an average of 30% annually. In the past year, Delta hiked its dividends per share 15%. In addition, if you look at the company’s free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, it consistently makes between $3 billion and $3.5 billion in FCF per quarter. Since Delta Air Lines stock has a market value of $39 billion, this means its FCF yield ranges from 8.1% to 9.5%. That is extremely high and indicates that Delta Air Lines is an attractive buy. Moreover, some have pointed out that Delta’s earnings are expected to grow over 7% year-over-year. In addition, FCF is expected to hit $4 billion next year, according to at least one analyst. Analysts covered by Seeking Alpha put its 2019 earnings per share estimates at $7.01 per share and $7.22 for 2020. That puts DAL stock on a very cheap 7x P/E ratio for 2019 and 7.2x for 2020. Recently, a number of analysts have pointed out that Delta has a number of revenue drivers. For example, one analyst at Seeking Alpha wrote this very interesting article about three upside catalysts DAL stock has. The article points out that DAL stock will benefit from: Delta recently held an Investors Day, on Dec. 12, 2019, where it highlighted its “global scale, powerful brand and unmatched competitive advantages.” So, as a result, a number of analysts wrote up the stock on a positive note. Guess which value investor really likes Delta Air Lines? Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) increased its stake earlier in April 2019 to nearly 11% of the company. Buffett started buying DAL in 2016’s third quarter, along with a number of other airline stocks. So far, Berkshire Hathaway has made over 30% on his stake in DAL, according to The Motley Fool.

8,5 Value Stocks That Will Make You Richer in 2020 | The Motley Fool,5 Value Stocks That Will Make You Richer in 2020. Bargains abound for patient long-term investors.. Exelixis. Spirit Airlines. The,"   In 2016, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch released an intriguing report that examined the average long-term returns of growth stocks and value stocks between 1926 and 2016. What the report found was that, while both groups of stocks proved excellent over the long run, value stocks held the edge, with an average annual return of 17% (versus 12.6% for growth stocks) over this 90-year period. Since the Great Recession, we've seen growth stocks handily outperform, which has a lot to do with the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates below their historic norm. Having abundant access to cheap capital has allowed high-growth businesses the opportunity to borrow and expand. But things could change in 2020, especially with Wall Street and investors on heightened recession watch. This could bring value stocks back into focus for the first time in about a decade. This is why I expect the following five value stocks to make investors richer in 2020. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. While value is most often defined by examining a company's trailing or forward price-to-earnings ratio, what makes cancer-drug developer Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) notoriously cheap among biotech stocks is its price-earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio). Generally, a PEG ratio below 1 implies a potentially undervalued stock. Exelixis' PEG ratio is just 0.4, and is indicative of the company's ongoing double-digit growth potential and reasonably low P/E ratio. What makes the wheels turn for Exelixis is Cabometyx, a therapy approved to treat advanced cases of renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). The reason Exelixis is valued at ""only"" 18 times next year's earnings per share (EPS) is the potential for increased competition in renal cell carcinoma, or RCC. Nevertheless, Cabometyx is the only second-line RCC indication to have led to statistically significant improvements in objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival, and it may be able to further cement its market share in first-line RCC via a treatment combination with key rival Opdivo, an immunotherapy produced by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Aside from riding Cabometyx to low double-digit growth, Exelixis somewhat recently reignited its internal research and development engine, and is building up quite the war chest of car, derived from its Cabometyx cash flow. Value investors are likely to realize just how inexpensive Exelixis really is in 2020. IMAGE SOURCE: SPIRIT AIRLINES.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Philip Georgiadis and Tanya Powley in London Ryanair has raised its profit guidance for this year after a better than expected Christmas and new year period thanks to last-minute bookings. The airline said on Friday that it now expected full-year pre-tax profit of between €950m and €1.05bn in its 2020 fiscal year ending in March, up from its previously forecast range of €800m to €900m. Based on current trading, it expects to hit the midpoint of the new range. Shares in Ryanair rose 8.5 per cent in early trading on Friday, while easyJet, British Airways owner IAG and Lufthansa also recorded gains as investors bet that Ryanair’s rivals will also have had a good Christmas. The latest figures are a welcome boost to Ryanair, which has suffered in the industry-wide disruption caused by the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jets after two fatal crashes. It has reduced its forecast for the number of passengers it expects to carry in its 2021 fiscal year twice, as it now expects to receive only 10 Max jets for the summer of 2020 rather than the 20 it previously planned. It has also outlined plans to close some of its bases and in December reduced its forecast for passenger traffic next year by 1m, to 156m. Daniel Roeska, aviation analyst, said: “EU airlines, and especially short-haul carriers, should make hay while the sun shines. With the Max still grounded and capacity growth at lower levels, this may indicate a better yield environment through winter and a more supportive trajectory for sector profits.” Analysts at broker Liberum said they expected easyJet in particular could have benefited from similar trends, although they warned that the effect of the Max grounding and the failure of travel company Thomas Cook meant that capacity growth in the short-haul market was “especially restrained”. Ryanair said on Friday that early bookings for this quarter were 1 per cent ahead of last year, with higher than expected fares. It also increased its forecast for passenger numbers this year from 153m to 154m. However, it warned that the outlook for its Austrian airline Laudamotion was less rosy — it has faced price competition in its local market so average fares over Christmas were lower than expected. Laudamotion’s net loss for the year is expected to widen from under €80m to about €90m.

Market Watch: Environmental concerns present airline sector with a serious,"  Willie Walsh, outgoing chief executive of IAG. He was dubbed a miracle worker for pulling Aer Lingus back from the brink after he took charge weeks after the September 11th, 2011, attacks. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Four years’ ago, as Willie Walsh stared at his 55th birthday, the age at which he once planned to retire, the former pilot gave himself a bit more time before pursuing his dream of unmooring his boat on the Thames and taking it up the Shannon or around the Irish coastline. “I see myself probably doing a few more years,” said the chief executive of International Airlines Group (IAG) in an interview at the time. Investors have reaped the benefits, with shares in IAG having soared 28 per cent since then. It brings total gains to 120 per cent since Walsh pushed through the creation of the aviation beast through the £5 billion (€5.89 billion) merger in 2011 of British Airways, where he was CEO, with then-struggling Spanish airline Iberia. It compares to a 44 per cent advance by the wider European stock market, measured by MSCI Europe Index. Total returns at IAG, including dividends, over the period topped 180 per cent over the period. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks have exceeded €4 billion. Not bad for a company in a sector more synonymous with burning through shareholders cash. It’s an industry that once famously prompted legendary US investor Warren Buffett to conclude that a lot of investors’ money would have been saved if capitalists had shot down the Wright brothers’ first plane. Buffett’s frustration doesn’t appear to have put him off, however, with his Berkshire Hathaway investment company currently holding four airline stocks. Dubbed a miracle worker for pulling Aer Lingus back from the brink after he took charge as CEO weeks after the September 11th, 2011, attacks with a plan to cut 2,000 jobs and move to a low-cost model, Walsh was hired as British Airways’ chief in 2005. Following the creation of IAG, he went on to mop up Barcelona-based Vueling, British Midlands, and in 2015, Aer Lingus, following careful courtship of the Government, which owned 25 per cent of the carrier, opposition parties, unions, county councillors and Ryanair, which controlled almost 30 per cent.

News,"Markets have seen wild swings in recent days as investors digest the latest news between the U.S. and Iran. But, is there opportunity to double down on volatility with the stocks most prone to outsized moves? AMD, Ulta Beauty, American Airlines, Marathon Petroleum and Mosaic are the stocks on Wall Street with the highest beta, a measure that indicates how much a stock moves relative to the broader market. “High beta is very interesting because you’re always going to see some moving and shaking. But we have to be careful because it’s these who live by the sword, die by the sword, and a recent victim of a high-beta sell-off is Ulta Beauty,” JC O’Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Wednesday. Ulta Beauty, which has fallen 25% in six months, could be a highly volatile stock worth a second look, according to O’Hara. “We actually like the short-term prospects here. It’s slowly starting to stabilize, starting to establish a base,” he said. “What really gets us excited is … the longer-term uptrend remains intact. If this stock repeats its pattern from 2016 to 2017 and from 2018 to 2019, those are two tests of that longer-term uptrend line and the rally off that line was in excess of 100% the first time, and then in 2018, we rallied 85%.”  “So we’re thinking if we rally again, similar to those past instances, we can at least at the minimum look to the 2019 highs at $365 so that’s a decent upside from here,” said O’Hara. Danielle Shay, director of options at Simpler Trading, said it pays to be cautious with broad markets at highs after a strong run, but does see one solid high-beta candidate. “We’ve seen just this massive rally and it’s difficult to buy any of them at the highs so of course buying them on a pullback makes sense, but I do love them, particularly AMD. This is very hot. The semiconductor space is hot. It’s going to continue expanding and growing,” Shay said during the same segment. AMD has led the semiconductor space and broader markets in the past year. The stock has risen 147% in the past 12 months, while the SMH semiconductor ETF is up 61%.

News Tips.","Biotech is headed for another big breakout. That’s according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, whose chart analysis shows the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) on a straight shot back to its all-time highs from 2015. “In October, ... it broke above its summer highs and saw this really nice rally into early December. At that point, we kind of put a cautionary yellow flag on the group because it became very, very overbought,” Maley told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday.  After a brief pullback into early December, “it’s starting to rally again, and that pullback worked off that overbought position quite a bit, so that’s a very nice setup,” Maley said. “It didn’t really have to pull back very much to work off that overbought position, so we’re creating a nice higher low.” If the IBB can now charge through its December highs — which happened to mirror the ETF’s double-top highs from 2018 — “that’s going to give it a great breakout and take it right back up to its all-time highs from 2015,” Maley said. A move to the IBB’s 2015 record of $133.60 a share represents a more than 10% gain from where it was trading early on Friday, around $121.40. “You break above that, it’s going to have a nice run,” the strategist said. “Now, we do have to worry about the election. As that tightens up over the summer, that could cause some problems if the Democrat starts to look like he or she might win, but I think that’s several months off and the group is setting up very well on a technical basis for a further run.” Gina Sanchez, founder and CEO of Chantico Global, said in the same “Trading Nation” interview that “the fundamentals definitely support what is happening” with the IBB’s trajectory. “The problem with biotech is it is a really capital-intensive business that takes a long time to come to fruition, but we’re actually at a point where you have a lot of potential therapies and new drugs that are very close to coming forward,” she said, adding that the success of those new therapies contributed to a robust biotech merger-acquisition cycle in 2019. “That continued throughout the year and I think that was part of really recognizing all the unlocked value that was sitting in these biotech companies,” Sanchez said. “That, plus cheap capital,","Jan 10, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/biotech-etf-to-rally-back-to-all-time-highs-chart.html

16,"What We Think Of Spirit Airlines, Inc.’s (NYSE:SAVE) Investment Potential - Simply Wall St News","What We Think Of Spirit Airlines, Inc.’s (NYSE:SAVE) Investment Potential. Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?. So, How","Today we'll look at Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) and reflect on its potential as an investment. Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business. Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE. ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'. The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) Or for Spirit Airlines: 0.096 = US$533m ÷ (US$6.6b - US$1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.) So, Spirit Airlines has an ROCE of 9.6%. Check out our latest analysis for Spirit Airlines One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies. Using our data, Spirit Airlines's ROCE appears to be around the 11% average of the Airlines industry. Aside from the industry comparison, Spirit Airlines's ROCE is mediocre in absolute terms, considering the risk of investing in stocks versus the safety of a bank account. Investors may wish to consider higher-performing investments. Spirit Airlines's current ROCE of 9.6% is lower than its ROCE in the past, which was 20%, 3 years ago. This makes us wonder if the business is facing new challenges. You can click on the image below to see (in greater detail) how Spirit Airlines's past growth compares to other companies. When considering this metric, keep in mind that it is backwards looking, and not necessarily predictive. ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Spirit Airlines. Current liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so","Jan 10, 2020",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-save/spirit-airlines/news/what-we-think-of-spirit-airlines-inc-s-nysesave-investment-potential
17,Ryanair raises profit guidance to €1bn as strong Christmas traffic lifts rivals : CityAM,Ryanair's €1bn profit upgrade lifts rival airlines' shares,"Ryanair profit upgrade today on better-than-expected Christmas traffic has lifted competitors’ shares on the FTSE as well as its own. Ryanair’s stock rose 6.6 per cent to €16.23 as it raised full-year profit guidance to beyond €1bn (£850m) after saying Christmas and New Year bookings were “stronger than expected”. Read more: Ryanair’s ‘abusive’ hand luggage fee has been banned The boost led the budget flyer to raise its full-year profit-after-tax guidance range from its €800m to €900m range to between €950m and €1.05bn. “On the basis of current trading, Ryanair expects to finish close to the mid-point of this new range,” the airline said. Ryanair reported that bookings between January and April are one per cent higher than this time a year ago. And the budget flyer also forecast that full-year group traffic will grow to 154m passengers, compared to its previous prediction of 153m. Its positive trading update also led to a jump in rivals’ stocks, helped by a drop in oil prices as US-Iran tensions cool. Easyjet’s share price climbed as much as 5.3 per cent to 1,515p while British Airways owner IAG rose 3.4 per cent to 656.4p per share. Ryanair also warned its Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion is still struggling. Net losses widened from €80m to €90m there. Ryanair said Laudamotion “continues to underperform” due to an ongoing pricing war with rivals. “This is a direct result of intense price competition with Lufthansa subsidiaries in both Germany and Austria who are engaged in below-cost selling,” Ryanair told investors.  Read more: Willie Walsh is retiring from British Airways owner IAG Laudamotion now expects to carry 6.5m passengers in the year to March 2020 but average fares are €15 below budget, leading to the widening losses. “Ryanair has defied fears about the airline market suffering from weaker demand and too much supply,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said. “Ryanair remains very well placed to take advantage of consolidation in short haul European air travel. But its low cost model is facing headwinds.” Liberum stuck to its ‘buy’ rating for Ryanair stock. The broker told investors: “We raise our current year forecasts by 24 per cent, having been below the midpoint of the previous range. We increase our target price to €19 from €12.50.” Copyright © 2020 CityAM.
