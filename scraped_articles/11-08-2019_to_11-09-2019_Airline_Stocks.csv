CNBC Newsletters,"Industrials stocks are busting out to new highs. The XLI industrials ETF soared to records on Thursday, while United Technologies and Kansas City Southern notched their own all-time highs. Caterpillar and UPS also moved to their highest levels of the year. “I think [this rally is] to be trusted,” Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday. “It’s a little bit early to say, but it looks like the industrial sector is breaking out relative to the broader market after a long-term basing phase so that’s very promising.” The XLI ETF, whose components include Boeing, Honeywell and Union Pacific, has added 4% in the past week, more than double the gains on the S&P 500. “Of course, on the individual stock level, we’re seeing a lot of breakouts in absolute terms,” Stockton said. “Some stocks are reaching new all-time highs like UTX, and some are just reaching interim highs like UPS and others. But, to me that tends to exacerbate the momentum behind a move, and I think it can persist.”  A few names that stand as buys above the rest, according to Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management. “I think in this space you want to be collecting an above-market dividend yield like you are with UPS and also UTX. That way you’re getting paid to wait while these stories work out,” she said during the same segment. UTX’s dividends yield 2% and UPS’ 3%. Both have a higher yield than the S&P 500 and broader industrials sector. “UPS put up great earnings this last quarter — growth in margins to the tune of 150 basis points all the while they were investing in the business. So to see the transports lead is bullish for us as investors but also for the overall market, so we’re looking at things like UTX, UPS, Boeing, and even 3M is starting to behave,” said Tengler.

And with costs firmly under control as JetBlue heads into Q4, and capacity rising between 4.5% and 6.5% year over year, analysts are forecasting a modest 5% rise in profits in Q4 as well (according to S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates), leaving JetBlue stock with $1.95 per share in GAAP earnings by year-end.

3,5 Chinese Stocks to Buy Now That Are Surging Higher | InvestorPlace,5 Chinese Stocks to Buy Surging Higher. Here are five Chinese stocks to buy worth a look. Baidu (BIDU). Alibaba," Source: Shutterstock U.S. equities have enjoyed a surge to new record highs this week amid burgeoning hopes that the Trump Administration will finally land a new trade deal with China. The chatter is that the United States is now willing to roll back trade tariffs to secure an agreement, something Beijing feels is a necessary precondition to them taking action on things like intellectual property protection. With Trump feeling some political heat right now, I expect him to soften his position and start saying yes. But don’t just take my word for it: A number of large U.S.-listed Chinese equities are surging higher on the hopes that a deal is forthcoming. Here are five Chinese stocks to buy worth a look: 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021  Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) shares are rising nearly another 4% on Friday, breaking free of a seven-month consolidation range to push towards its 200-day moving average. Watch for a return to the prior trading range seen at the start of the year, with price target of $175 worth a gain of roughly 40% from here. The company will next report results on Feb. 20 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.20 per share on revenues of $3.9 billion. The stock was recently upgraded to “buy” from analysts at CLSA. 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021  Shares of Chinese internet retailer Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are breaking up and over their second-half trading range to push towards prior highs set in early May. Watch for a run to the upper end of its three-year consolidation range near $210, which would be worth a gain of more than 10% from here. The company recently reported strong results, with earnings growing 40% from the prior year despite China’s GDP growth rate posting its slowest growth since 1992. BABA is one of the top Chinese stocks to buy. 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021  Shares of China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) are emerging from an eight-month wedge pattern, with a challenge of the 2019 highs likely for a gain of roughly 50% from here. The stock was just upgraded to “buy” by analysts at UBS and Goldman Sachs, with the stock looking ready for its first major uptrend since late 2017.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   The question undoubtedly will accompany New Jersey's Taylor Hall to Vancouver when the Devils meet the Canucks on Sunday afternoon. Will the pending free agent left wing be willing to re-sign in New Jersey or would he rather test the market in pursuit of a Stanley Cup championship? Hall, who turns 28 on Thursday, will be an unrestricted free agent on next July 1, and only the Devils can give him the maximum eight-year deal. ""I haven't even thought about it,"" Hall said last week when asked about free agency. ""It's too hard to even rule out or in any teams at this point."" That leaves a handful of clubs who possibly would be willing to sign the Calgary native to a bigger deal than the seven-year, $42 million contract he brought with him from the Edmonton Oilers, his original team. The Devils acquired Hall for defenseman Adam Larsson - the fourth overall pick in the 2011 draft - on June 29, 2016. Hall was the No. 1 pick in the 2010 draft, and the player-for-player trade appeared to be a one-sided one. But Hall's time in New Jersey has turned from outstanding and award-winning - he collected the Hart Trophy as the league's MVP in the 2017-18 campaign - to fairly below-average play, considering the standard the star forward has set. He has just two goals and 12 assists in 15 games on the season, and there is a sense of disappointment surrounding the Devils (4-7-4) after they acquired P.K. Subban, Wayne Simmonds and Nikita Gusev, plus added center Jack Hughes -- the No. 1 pick in the NHL draft in June -- to their roster. Defenseman Sami Vatanen left Friday night's 4-0 shutout loss in Edmonton after taking an elbow to the face from the Oilers' Alex Chiasson. He did not return to the game and no update was given on his condition. The Canucks have cooled off after a sizzling 8-1-1 stretch, sliding to 1-2-2 in their past five games after a 4-1 loss in Winnipeg on Friday night - their ninth straight loss to the","Nov 9, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/struggling-devils-hope-answers-vs-canucks-183258685--nhl.html
8,Singapore Airlines Limited Earnings Missed Analyst Estimates: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Now - Simply Wall St News,Singapore Airlines Limited Earnings Missed Analyst Estimates: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Now. The Bottom Line. Discounted cash flow calculation,"As you might know, Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) recently reported its second-quarter numbers. Earnings per share fell badly short of expectations, coming in at S$0.079, some 42% below analyst forecasts, although revenues were okay, approximately in line with analyst estimates at S$4.2b. Following the result, analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent forecasts to see whether analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results. View our latest analysis for Singapore Airlines Taking into account the latest results, Singapore Airlines's 13 analysts currently expect revenues in 2020 to be S$17b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Earnings per share are expected to shrink 2.4% to S$0.57 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, analysts had been forecasting revenues of S$17b and earnings per share (EPS) of S$0.65 in 2020. Analysts seem to have become more bearish following the latest results. While there were no changes to revenue forecasts, there was a real cut to EPS estimates. The consensus price target held steady at S$10.46, with analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Singapore Airlines at S$11.80 per share, while the most bearish prices it at S$8.97. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggests analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth. Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether analysts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the market. We can infer from the latest estimates that analysts are expecting a continuation of Singapore Airlines's historical trends, as next year's forecast 1.6% revenue growth is roughly in line with 1.6% annual revenue growth over the past five years. Compare this with the wider market (in aggregate), which analyst estimates suggest will see revenues fall","Nov 8, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/sg/transportation/sgx-c6l/singapore-airlines-shares/news/singapore-airlines-limited-earnings-missed-analyst-estimates-heres-what-analysts-are-forecasting-now/
9,A List of SPDR ETFs for Investment,Considering SPDR ETFs for Your Investment Portfolio? Here's a List. The SPY SPDR ETF. A List of SPDRs. ," SPDRs are a great way to gain exposure to a variety of markets and sectors while reaping the benefits of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For those who are new to SPDRs, they are the nickname for Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts.1﻿ If you find yourself in conversation about them, the acronym is pronounced ""spider."" SPDRs are a family of ETFs traded in the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Managed by State Street Global Advisors, SPDRs are like a mini-portfolio of stocks and derivatives that have the goal of emulating an investment vehicle, usually an index, commodity, or strategy. SPDRs track some of the most actively traded indexes and commodities on the U.S. exchanges.2 The ticker symbol ""SPY"" represents the SPDR ETF that tracks the S&P 500. If you have an interest in the stock market, or specifically in the S&P 500, buying SPY shares may be the best way to beef up your investment portfolio. Investing in this SPDR ETF is easier than investing directly in the S&P 500 because the latter would involve individually buying all 505 stocks traded on the S&P 500. That's not only logistically difficult—it's also expensive. You would have to make hundreds of trades to fill your portfolio with the same stocks as the S&P 500.
As you build this portfolio, you'll battle index pricing and any transaction costs or additional fees. The ETF, on the other hand, is pre-packaged with fractional shares of every stock in the actual S&P 500. With one transaction, the SPY SPDR gives investors instant exposure to the entire index. Another advantage of ETF trading is the tax benefit. Like any investment, there are potential disadvantages to ETF investing that must be considered, but there is a reason SPDRs are some of the most popular investment vehicles. So, if you’re ready to include SPDRs in your portfolio, here's a comprehensive list to help you find the right ETF for your investing strategy. The holdings in these ETFs are usually updated quarterly, and the specific strategies may change over time, so be sure to research the most recent data before adding them to your portfolio. Each one is listed with its ticker symbol given first.  ","Nov 9, 2019",https://www.thebalance.com/a-list-of-spdrs-1214804

(NASDAQ:CHTR) is giving Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a run for its money. The telecommunications company is up by around 65% year-to-date, on par with Apple’s 2019 growth. Charter’s ascent is impressive considering that Apple has managed to outperform its FAANG peers. Thus, CHTR’s monumental ascent prompted us to look into the stock and uncover the drivers of growth. Here are three reasons why Charter has managed to keep up with the iPhone maker in terms of stock performance. One of the primary reasons why CHTR has been on a tear is because the company has been fiercely retiring its shares through buybacks. In the third-quarter, the telecoms firm spent $2.767 billion on stock buybacks. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. The company has been retiring shares since September 2016. Chris Winfrey, Charter’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call, Since September of 2016, we’ve repurchased 21% of Charter’s equity at an average price of $330 per share. As of September 2019, that number has climbed to an impressive 23%. So far, the company has given no indication that it plans to halt its aggressive buybacks anytime soon. This is positive news for long-term investors. A management team that spends billions in retiring shares should help give CHTR a long-term rosy outlook. It also gives the equity an advantage over AAPL’s performance. Charter’s management is buying back shares because they see the company’s upside potential.

12,Why Should 10% of Your Portfolio be Diversified in Bitcoin?,Why Should 10% of Your Portfolio be Diversified in Bitcoin?. What would be the smartest thing for a fast-food company,"As a kid, my weekly Friday routine was a trip to Macdonald’s. I loved it! I still remember the happy meal with hot fries, crispy chicken McNuggets, ice-cold coke, and a surprise toy inside. I remember the yellow & red theme, the clown Ronald Macdonald, and many choices or burgers I could select. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, that I was an unwilling member of my primary school’s Trim And Fit Club (TAF Club). Being in my 30s now, I tend to go Macdonald’s (a lot) less. I think there was a season, where I didn’t visit the fast-food chain for years until an interesting documentary caught my attention. It was called “Super-size me” and follows a 30-day period during which the filmmaker ate only McDonald’s food. He gained about 11kg by the end of the 30 days, telling the world something everyone already knows: “Fast food is bad for you.” Obesity in the United States is viewed as a major health issue. It is believed to result in numerous diseases, specifically increased risk of certain types of cancer, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, as well as significant increases in early mortality and economic costs. They diversified their products. Macdonald’s started offering healthier options like grilled chicken wraps and cup corn. According to reports, by CNBC and business insider, sale of McMuffins are soaring after a switch from using margarine to butter. Macdonald’s diversifying into more wholesome food offerings, as taste around the world, is getting healthier. Even for myself, when I buy Macdonald’s these days, I often swap my fries for cup corn instead. Most investment professionals agree that, while diversification doesn’t guarantee against losses, it is the most important component to minimise risk and achieve long-term financial goals. Diversification is a method that allocates investments among various financial instruments, industries, and other categories with the agenda of reducing risk and maximizing returns. This is done by investing in areas that would react differently to the same event. Investopedia gives a great example of this. If we have a portfolio of only airline stocks, and it is announced that airline pilots are going on an indefinite strike and that all flights are cancelled, share prices of airline stocks will drop.

By Choi Kyong-ae SEOUL, Nov. 8 (Yonhap) -- The stock prices of Asiana Airlines Inc. and its affiliates advanced Friday after three consortia joined a final auction to acquire the country's second-biggest airline. Asiana shares jumped 9.6 percent to 5,820 won, information and technology solutions provider Asiana IDT Inc. soared by nearly the daily limit of 30 percent to 22,650 won and low-cost carrier Air Busan Co. soared 12 percent to 7,150 won. The broader KOSPI erased earlier gains to end in negative territory, falling 0.3 percent to 2,137.23. On Thursday, the Aekyung-Stone Bridge Capital consortium, the consortium of Hyundai Development Co. (HDC) and Mirae Asset Daewoo, and the consortium of the Korea Corporate Governance Improvement (KCGI) and BankerStreet private equity funds submitted their final bids to Credit Suisse, the sole lead manager of the deal.  Aekyung and HDC reportedly presented the acquisition prices of around 1.5 trillion won (US$1.3 billion) and about 2.5 trillion won, respectively, for the country's second-biggest airline after Korean Air Lines Co. ""News reports that HDC has submitted a price that is far higher than Aekyung's appear to have helped drive up Asiana's and its affiliate's stock prices,"" Mirae Asset Daewoo analyst Park Hee-chul said over the phone. In contrast, HDC plunged 7.3 percent to 31,050 won, and HDC Holdings declined 6.3 percent to 11,850 won. Aekyung Co. also shed 1.8 percent to 29,450 won because of the financial burden facing it. Among the bidders, Aekyung Group has been the most aggressive, stressing it is the only strategic investor that has 13 years of experience and know-how in operating an airline. The cosmetics-to-airline conglomerate said there is no precedent in which a company that does not have experience of operating an airline has succeeded in airline acquisition. As it has Jeju Air Co., the country's biggest low-cost carrier, under its wing, its acquisition of Asiana Airlines is in line with global M&A trends. Kumho Asiana Group, the parent of Asiana Airlines, aims to sell the stake in the airline held by its subsidiary, Kumho Industrial Co., together with its six affiliates as part of its broad restructuring efforts. The six affiliates include two budget carriers -- Air Seoul Inc., which is wholly owned by Asiana Airlines, and Air Busan, which is 46 percent owned by","Nov 8, 2019",https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191108003651320

Musk’s tweet comes in response to Einhorn’s letter released earlier this week in which he referenced an ongoing lawsuit against Musk by Tesla shareholders who claim he failed to fully disclose a “liquidity crisis” at SolarCity prior to Tesla’s 2016 buyout of the solar company. “To the surprise of nobody, documents in TSLA’s SolarCity litigation unsealed in September showed that Elon Musk knowingly orchestrated a significant fraud by arranging the $2.6 billion acquisition at a time when SolarCity was insolvent,” Einhorn wrote in his letter. “For now, the accepted reality appears to be that Elon Musk is above the law.” Tesla shares are up more than 40% in the past month after the company reported its first quarterly profit of 2019 in the third quarter. pic.twitter.com/w0BkNGbvQ1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 8, 2019 “Please allow us to send you a small gift of short shorts to help you through this difficult time,” Musk wrote on Friday. Following the recent rally, Tesla shares have nearly recovered all of their late 2018 and early 2019 losses and are now down just 3.8% overall in the past year. Einhorn’s struggles have been well-documented in recent years, as fund managers that rely heavily on traditional value investing strategies continue to underperform. However, Musk’s repeated taunting of short sellers will likely embolden critics who have referred to him as immature and bratty. Tesla's stock traded around $335 per share at time of publication.

15,How can zero-dollar commissions be successful? | The Seattle Times,How can zero-dollar commissions be successful?. Most Read Business Stories. . . . . . . . . . ,"Ask the Fool Free Trading Commissions Q: My brokerage has just announced that online stock trades will now cost $0. Is that sustainable? — H.R., Pawtucket, Rhode Island A: It certainly can be. Once a brokerage has its trading technology set up, it doesn’t cost a lot to execute trades. Keep in mind, too, that trading commissions are not the brokerage’s only source of income. Like banks, brokerages get a lot of money from “net interest” — the difference in the interest rate they pay customers for cash deposits and the interest rate they earn when they invest customers’ cash. They also collect interest when investors borrow funds with which to buy stocks (“on margin”). Many brokerages these days are also generating income via asset management — offering research and advice to customers. Then there are fees: These include fees for “account maintenance,” paper statements, inactivity or when you buy or sell mutual funds. There’s also income to be collected from the difference, or “spread,” between a stock’s “bid” price (what an investor is willing to buy the stock for) and “ask” price (what a seller is willing to sell it for). Q: Are Social Security benefits going up much in 2020? — C.L., Portland, Oregon A: The cost of living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security in 2020 is 1.6%, considerably lower than 2019’s 2.8% increase. With the average monthly retirement benefits check recently at $1,475, a 1.6% increase will mean $23.60 more per month, or about $283 more annually. It’s not a lot, but in retirement, every little bit can help. You can learn more about Social Security and how you may be able to increase your benefits by searching for the terms “Social Security” and “Motley Fool” in Google.  My Dumbest Investment Pumped and Dumped My dumbest investment was buying a pump-and-dump pharmaceutical stock when it was in full “pump” mode. Seemed like a good idea at the time — ha! — T.N., online The Fool responds: You fell for a classic kind of stock market con. It’s typically penny stocks (those trading for less than about $5 per share) that are involved in pump-and-dump schemes, because they have relatively few shares available for trading, and they’re easy to manipulate. Here’s how the schemes work: A con artist buys a bunch of shares of a certain stock and then starts hyping it — online or via email,","Nov 9, 2019",https://www.seattletimes.com/business/how-can-0-commissions-be-successful/
16,"Have no interest in Air India, only IndiGo: Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker - The Financial Express","Have no interest in Air India, only IndiGo: Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker. “We have no interest in buying","Qatar Airways on Thursday ruled out participation in the sale of national carrier Air India. However, the airline’s chief executive officer (CEO) Akbar Al Baker said it can look to invest in budget carrier IndiGo at an appropriate time. “We have no interest in buying stake in Air India. We are interested in buying stake in IndiGo, but this is not the right time as issues among promoters are yet to be resolved,” Baker told reporters. In the past, Baker has expressed interest in picking up stakes in an Indian carrier and setting up a domestic airline in the country. Meanwhile, IndiGo and Qatar Airways have signed a one-way codeshare agreement giving the middle-eastern carrier further access into the Indian market. The codeshare pact will enable Qatar Airways to place its code on IndiGo flights between Doha and Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad. It means that Qatar Airways can now sell IndiGo tickets for onward journey from these three cities. IndiGo CEO Ronojoy Dutta said that both carriers were working on a reciprocal agreement which would be announced soon. This is the second codeshare agreement for IndiGo as part of its growth strategy for international markets; it signed a two-way codeshare agreement with Turkish Airlines in December last year. Qatar Airways has been looking to increase its presence in one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world. The full-service carrier has been urging the government to increase the bilateral flying rights between Qatar and India. Under the current bilaterals, both countries have a quota of 24,292 weekly seats each. According to the ministry of civil aviation, the Qatari side has exhausted its quota utilising 24,655 seats with 102 weekly flights between Doha and 13 destinations in India, including Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Goa, Kolkata, Mumbai and Thiruvananthapuram. On the other hand, the Indian carriers are using around 12,000 seats per week to Qatar.
