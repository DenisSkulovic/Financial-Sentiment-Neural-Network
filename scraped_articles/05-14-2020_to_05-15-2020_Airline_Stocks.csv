Airline stocks are all but doomed according to the IATA’s latest prediction, but Southwest could be a diamond in the rough. By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released a report this week detailing its gloomy baseline scenario for the future of air travel. The association’s outlook is terrible news for all but one airline— Southwest (NYSE:LUV). LUV stock has been beaten down alongside the rest of the industry, but the IATA report confirms that value investors should be scooping up this diamond in the rough. The IATA report is brutal— with passenger demand around the globe seen coming in 32% lower than expected. What’s more, the organization says it foresees airline travel reaching 2019 levels in 2023. That means airlines are going to suffer at least another three years.  But there is a shining light for Southwest, whose dominance among domestic travel will become its superpower during the industry’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The IATA expects domestic traveler demand to return to 2019 levels a year earlier in 2022.  That may not sound like much, but it could offer a window of opportunity to Southwest in the coming years. The association found that 58% of passengers will stick to domestic travel only even as borders open up.  That should be music to LUV shareholders’ ears because it means the firm is uniquely positioned to see a recovery across its entire business.

Back"," Home » Investor News » Airline Stocks Take a Beating. Now Is the Time to Invest — in Options  Posted by Shaun Cox | May 14, 2020 | Investing 4 minute, 6 second read While the U.S. continues to struggle through nationwide lockdowns, a sector that has taken a major beating is airline stocks, which took another dive this week after Boeing Co-CEO David Calhoun warned of more pain coming — including a major bankruptcy. Airline stocks have cratered in the aftermath of the coronavirus lockdown, and it was recently revealed that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway sold all four of their holdings (for a huge loss). Airline stocks then suffered another broad sell-off this week immediately after Calhoun predicted a major U.S. company will go bankrupt this year. “I don’t want to get too predictive on that subject, but yes, most likely,” Calhoun said Tuesday on NBC’s “Today” program in reference to a major bankruptcy. “You know, something will happen when September comes around. Since the broader stock market peaked in mid-February, all four major U.S. airlines have cratered as demand has fallen off a cliff. Since topping out around $59 in mid-February, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL
) has fallen just under $20. Meanwhile, over the same time period, United Airlines Holding Inc. (Nasdaq: UAL
) tanked from just over $80 a share to about $20 and is the second-worst S&P 500 stock year to date. American Airlines Group Inc. (Nasdaq: AAL
) has fallen from around $30 to $9 — its all-time low — and Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV
) has sunk from about $59 all the way under $24.  All told, the four major U.S. airline stocks have cratered just under 68% on average, which obviously is a brutal decline in such a short period — and with little to look forward to in the coming months. But Wednesday, legendary investor Bill Miller had his own take on airline stocks, saying “you’re making a bet against the vaccine” if you don’t own them in regard to the likelihood the U.S. will have a coronavirus vaccine at some point in the next year or so. So are airline stocks a good investment while they’re down so much?

Review Our Cookie Policy Here             When people are out of work, scared of a deadly virus, and entire cities are shut down, air travel is one of the last things on their mind. And the highly capital intensive airline industry is now paying the price for not hoarding cash in an industry with an extremely high rate of bankruptcy. The White House made their intention to bail out the industry clear, but which airlines will need bailouts? Will the bailouts wipe out equity holders like the GM bailout did in 2008?  Seeing the 60% haircut the CoronaCrash gave to the airline industry, many investors are grabbing their fishing rods to do some bottom fishing.  Warren Buffett has once said that the smartest move a capitalist could have made regarding airlines is shooting down the Wright Brothers. If you bring up the idea of investing in an airline among a group of conservative value investors, you’ll get a similar response. So, why is it that investors hate airlines, and are their stock prices being punished? Regardless of the number of passengers aboard a flight, an airline pays basically the same price to operate that flight. Whether the airline sells two or 200 tickets, the fuel costs the same, their employee’s wages stay the same, and the route fees they pay to airports remain. This means that the profitability of an airline is mostly dependent upon their ability to fill flights to near capacity. The struggle to control these massive fixed costs leads to the massive outsourcing of less popular regional routes to regional airlines. This happens when you book a flight with a major airline like Delta and end up on a small jet operated by a smaller carrier. The cost of capital means exactly what it sounds like; it’s a weighted average of the company’s cost to access capital, whether that’s through debt or equity. To most, if a company can’t at least earn its cost of capital over time, it’s an investable capital destruction vehicle.

6,Warren Buffett Sold Southwest Airlines (LUV) Stock Way Too Early | InvestorPlace,Warren Buffett Sold Southwest Airlines Stock Way Too Early. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly believes the billionaire is far too," Thanks to the novel coronavirus, airline stocks are seriously suffering. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) fell from $58 to $25.80. But LUV stock isn’t alone. Since peaking at $30.78 in February 2020, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) plunged to $9.56. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) fell from $60 to $22. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) plummeted from $84 to less than $24. Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) fell from $44 to less than $10.  These stocks have all been decimated by stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and earnings disasters. Worse, according to Cowen analyst Helane Becker, “Most airline managements are realizing that domestic traffic will be slow to recover, in part because the country is opening at different times. Until various quarantines are lifted and most people get back to work we do not see any recovery for air traffic.” News that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) just sold all of its airline holdings didn’t help. However, it appears Buffett may have overreacted by selling too early. After all, as Buffett himself used to say, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” While I wouldn’t back up the truck on airline stocks, they have become some of the top blood-in-the-street opportunities. That includes LUV stock, which could recover to $57 in the long term. As I pointed out earlier this week, Warren Buffett sold out of fear. Part of his reasoning: “I don’t know whether it’s two or three years from now that as many people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year. The future is much less clear to me about how the business will turn out through absolutely no fault of the airlines themselves.” I agree with Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly who says Buffett is being far too pessimistic. “It’s a pessimistic one. I am far more optimistic,” Kelly said in regards to Buffett’s reasoning. In addition, the CEO said he doesn’t believe the industry will see a sustained downturn in air travel. “I believe this too shall pass. You go back to the Spanish Flu in 1918, it was followed by the roaring 20’s. Life will get back to normal. It is a question of how long that is going to take.” Plus, as I noted earlier this week, Kelly recently told Face the Nation that it’s safe to fly again. “I don’t think the risk on an airplane is any greater risk than","May 14, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/05/warren-buffett-sold-luv-stock-too-early/
7,"When It Comes to UAL Stock, Listen to Warren Buffett | InvestorPlace","When It Comes to United Airlines Stock, Listen to Warren Buffett. It’s tough to be bullish on the shares now."," While the markets were in bull mode, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock still did not do very well. Note that the shares are close to their 52-week low, which was set in mid-March. For the year so far, the stock has tumbled a grueling 73%.  But could UAL stock provide investors with a value opportunity? Could the markets be overreacting? In normal times, that would seem to be a good bet. But of course, we are not in normal times. The novel coronavirus has destabilized the airline industry. Airlines’ traffic volumes are off by over 90%. Yet they are still flying many planes, often because of contractual obligations. The result is that the industry is burning huge amounts of cash. Gauging what may ultimately happen is extremely complicated, if not impossible. But I think we have gotten one major sign and it is far from positive. Specifically, Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK.B) Warren Buffett recently unloaded his 9% stake in UAL stock. He also sold off his positions in Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Here’s what Buffett had to say: “The world has changed for the airlines. And I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way.” Going forward, it seems like airlines will need to rethink how they board and seat passengers. They may, for example, have to keep the middle seats empty. But of course, that would lead to much less revenue generation. For United in particular,  we have already seen an example of how this can go awry. One of its flights that departed from Newark, New Jersey last weekend was actually packed! Photos of the flight have since gone viral on social media platforms like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). One of the passengers was a doctor had gone to New York City to help treat coronavirus patients. But after the flight, he said he would not be flying again for quite some time. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE It’s important to note that United did provide the flight for free to the healthcare workers. Yet this incident shows that the airlines really need to be more proactive when it comes to social distancing if they want to get customers more comfortable with flying. If they don’t do that, the industry’s recovery may be prolonged. In its","May 14, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/05/when-it-comes-to-united-airlines-stock-listen-to-warren-buffett/

SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE","The airline industry has suffered considerably as the coronavirus pandemic continues to drag on, and now Delta Airlines is slashing a part of its fleet as the airline looks to mitigate economic damages from the pandemic. Delta announced Thursday that it may have a deluge of pilots this fall, as many as 7,000 more than necessary. As a result, the airline said it plans to retire its fleet of Boeing 777s, suggesting that Delta expects a lengthy downturn in international travel as the coronavirus crushes demand, and consumers avoid vacations and close quarters, where the virus can easily spread. John Laughter, Delta’s senior vice president of flight operations, said in a note to pilots Thursday, “I recognize that is an alarming number so it’s important to know that our intent is to align staffing for what we need over the long term. By the third quarter of 2021, we will have between 2,500 and 3,500 pilots more than needed to fly the schedule. That accounts for the pilots who will reach the mandatory retirement age between now and next summer.” CEO Ed Bastian stated in a staff memo that the airline plans to curtail its daily cash burn by the end of 2020 as the pandemic’s toll on air travel currently has no end in sight. “Our principal financial goal for 2020 is to reduce our cash burn to zero by the end of the year, which will mean, for the next two to three years, a smaller network, fleet, and operation in response to substantially reduced customer demand,” Bastian’s memo said. Delta said it has already made a 50% reduction in its daily cash burn to $50 million a day this month, as planned, by slashing flights and cutting back on other expenses. “With international travel expected to return slowly, we’ve also made the difficult decision to permanently retire our Boeing 777 fleet — 18 aircraft — by the end of the year,” Bastian told staff. He said more “fuel-efficient and cost-effective” A330s and A350-900 planes, made by Europe’s Airbus will be used instead. “Retiring a fleet as iconic as the 777 is not an easy decision — I know it has a direct impact on many of you who fly, crew and service these jets.” Other airlines and ETFs have been affected by the news Thursday as well.

9,ETF Focus Daily: Airline Stocks Are Too Cheap To Ignore - ETF Focus on TheStreet: ETF research and Trade Ideas,ETF Focus Daily: Airline Stocks Are Too Cheap To Ignore. What To Watch. 3 ETF Trade Ideas For The Week,"Good morning! Here's the ETF Daily Trading Digest for Friday, May 15, 2020. The Fed's unlimited stimulus program continues with the balance sheet almost at a stunning $7 trillion. Retail sales data will emphasize worries about the economy falling into a deflationary spiral, but I firmly believe that all of this money printing will have a strong inflationary impact, if not immediately then eventually. Stocks rose into yesterday's close, which is a bullish sign, but equities look like they're ready to give those gains back in early Friday trading. With any COVID-19 headlines in traders' focus, I keep watching for how the states' economic reopenings are going, both in terms of consumer interest and health risks. iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) The Fed's purchase of corporate bond ETFs earlier this week led some to try front-running the transaction. There was some bounce when the announcement was made earlier, but no reaction once the trade itself was made. I see no outperformance opportunity here and remain neutral on the entire investment-grade corporate bond space. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) JETS is now trading at all-time lows, but the value here is too compelling to ignore. Airline traffic is next to zero right now, but the airlines are being priced as if the whole sector is going under. The sector will take years to recover, but at a P/E of 7, it's an excellent buy low opportunity if you're willing to buy and hold for a while. iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) Most market watchers are expecting a deflationary spiral here, but I think we'll get inflationary pressure from the Fed stimulus. The market isn't pricing in future inflation right now, which makes it an ideal time to buy low on TIPS. The Fed is committed to keeping interest rates low, but the enormous stimulus packages should eventually spike inflation. The Fed added more than $300 million in corporate bonds to its balance sheet this week, adding support to this market. Retail sales were abysmal, as expected, and I expect little market reaction. Yesterday's rally off early day lows is an encouraging sign for market bulls.

11,Should I short airline stocks? - Quora,,"Why? Why do you want to short the aerospace, airplane leasing, or airline industry? Here are some airlines currently trading with 70–90% of their value already lost.                     The boat you just missed is just ferry. Don’t worry, there will be one coming up soon. Needless to say, they all cratered. Shorting them now does not make sense. They will rebound. After that, then yes it makes sense. Another way to play airlines is to go after … leasing companies. Airlines do not buy their planes. They enter into capital leasing agreements with leasing companies. At the moment, airlines struggle to fill their planes and make their payments, which will inevitably lead to default, which will lead leasing companies to write down impairments.

However, a trader who has shorted stock can lose much more than 100% of their original investment. Why You Should Never Short a Stock Selling short is best when the stock is above $20 as professional traders tend to avoid stocks that are lower priced to sell short.

Then it took just a little over a month to erase 20 percentage points' worth of those losses. But is this the end of the story? Is the ""sale"" over, and is it now too late to buy stocks and cash in on the rebound? Not necessarily. True, the stock market as a whole may no longer sell for bargain basement prices, but hundreds of individual stocks are still marked down 30% (or more) off the prices they fetched at the beginning of this year. The ""sale,"" in fact, is far from over. And here are three top stocks you can still buy on sale today. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The Internal Revenue Service has announced the traditional April 15 deadline for filing individual income taxes is delayed to July 15, 2020. But does that change reduce penalties for underpayment? How does it affect estimated tax payments for this year? And what about the $1,200 stimulus payments that some of us are still waiting to receive -- how do those figure into the mix? Burning questions like these are a big reason investors might want to take a look at H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) stock right now. Arguably the biggest name in income tax preparation, H&R Block got hit right along with the rest of the stock market in February's sell-off and hasn't recovered since. In fact, its shares remain down roughly 32% since the start of the year. That might not be such a bad thing, however, if you are shopping for stocks on sale. Priced at just 7.5 times trailing earnings today, H&R Block stock looks bargain-priced for the 10% annualized long-term growth that Wall Street analysts expect from it. The stock could be even cheaper if -- as I suspect might happen -- confused taxpayers flock to H&R Block for advice this year, making the company's forecast decline in earnings not so steep as feared. To top it all off, H&R Block stock still pays a whopping 6.6% dividend yield, and unlike so many stocks these days, it shows no signs of planning to cut that dividend.

Air Canada Stock Is Down 30% This Month After Warren Buffett Dumps,"      Aditya Raghunath | May 14, 2020 | More on: AC Shares of Canada’s airline giant Air Canada (TSX:AC) have fallen over 30% this month, at the time of writing. This stock has been volatile in the recent past, and for good reason. Shares were trading at record highs at the start of 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has completely decimated the airline and travel sectors. Economies have come to a standstill, as governments all around the world have shut their borders. Air traffic for Air Canada and peers have fallen close to 90% in the last month, which has led to a significant decline in stock prices. Air Canada stock is currently trading at $14.1, which is 73% below its record high. Air Canada stock touched a multi-year low of $9.26 in mid-March. It then recovered to trade above $21 at the end of April. Since the start of May, shares have nosedived yet again. So, what has driven the stock lower in the first half of May 2020? Earlier this month, noted investor Warren Buffett announced his exit from the airline sector. Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway dumped its entire stake in top airline companies such as Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines Holdings and American Airlines Group. Buffett admitted that he was wrong to invest in the airline sector. Warren Buffett has generally advised investors to remain greedy in a market sell-off. However, he recently confirmed that Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks in April. Does this mean the Oracle of Omaha forecasts more pain ahead for Air Canada investors? Airlines are capital-intensive businesses and are burning millions of dollars each day just to stay afloat. It’s also a cyclical industry and among the worst-hit in an economic downturn. Right now, there are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and no one knows for sure what the future holds. It might take years before normal air traffic resumes. To counter the impact of low air traffic, Air Canada has delayed capital expenditure this year. It has also targeted cost savings of $500 million in 2020. The Canadian airline has been running cargo flights to transport essential commodities and offset a part of the revenue decline. However, despite taking these steps, Air Canada, like most other peers, might need a bailout if lockdowns persist.

Deal-making days,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | May 15, 2020 | More on: AC Warren Buffett is acting a bit peculiar in the 2020 market crash. The astute billionaire investor is gun shy and not in a hurry to use his US$137 billion cash stockpile. Why? The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway says the coronavirus-induced crisis is different. In the second quarter of this year, Buffett became a net seller of stocks instead of an aggressive buyer. His most significant move so far is the sale of Berkshire’s entire stakes in four large U.S. airline companies. The value investor is confirming now that his disdain for the airline industry since 2007 was right after all. Buffett’s reversing course on airline stocks will influence investors across the border. If you have holdings in Air Canada (TSX:AC), should you dump the TSX stock? There were American companies that approached Berkshire for financial assistance when the pandemic was raging. But the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened before Buffett’s conglomerate can extend help. The companies got the needed funding support. According to Buffett, he sees no attractive investments at this time. He will remain motionless because the range of economic possibilities is extraordinarily broad. Berkshire has no intention of propping up a business with constant losses. However, Buffett is not closing the door to future investments. He could return to deal-making mode. It could be next week, next month, or next year depending on the scenarios that will play out. So far, he is keeping his two TSX gems, Suncor Energy and Restaurant Brands International. Buying into Air Canada is out of the question. Air Canada will start operating with 150 flights weekly in the second quarter of 2020. That would have been good news for the ailing company. Unfortunately, they are all-cargo flights only. This $4.49 billion company is still on a passenger flight lockdown. The cargo-only flying will drive revenues during the second quarter but will not prevent the company from a crash landing.  On May 4, 2020, Air Canada reported a steep loss in Q1 2020. The stock’s year-to-date loss, as of this writing, is almost 65%. In 2019, the full-year gain was 86.9%. The revenue drop and deterioration of operating losses during the first quarter were sharp and quick. But the real extent of damage will be known when Air Canada reports Q2 2020 results.

18,Air Canada Stock Is Down 30% This Month After Warren Buffett Dumps Airline Companies,. S&P/TSX. S&P 500. DOW. CAD/USD. CRUDE OIL. BTC-CAD. CMC Crypto 200. GOLD FUTURES. RUSSELL 2000. 10-Yr Bond. NASDAQ. VOLATILITY.," Shares of Canada’s airline giant Air Canada (TSX:AC) have fallen over 30% this month, at the time of writing. This stock has been volatile in the recent past, and for good reason. Shares were trading at record highs at the start of 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has completely decimated the airline and travel sectors. Economies have come to a standstill, as governments all around the world have shut their borders. Air traffic for Air Canada and peers have fallen close to 90% in the last month, which has led to a significant decline in stock prices. Air Canada stock is currently trading at $14.1, which is 73% below its record high. Air Canada stock touched a multi-year low of $9.26 in mid-March. It then recovered to trade above $21 at the end of April. Since the start of May, shares have nosedived yet again. So, what has driven the stock lower in the first half of May 2020? Earlier this month, noted investor Warren Buffett announced his exit from the airline sector. Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway dumped its entire stake in top airline companies such as Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines Holdings and American Airlines Group. Buffett admitted that he was wrong to invest in the airline sector. Warren Buffett has generally advised investors to remain greedy in a market sell-off. However, he recently confirmed that Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks in April. Does this mean the Oracle of Omaha forecasts more pain ahead for Air Canada investors? Airlines are capital-intensive businesses and are burning millions of dollars each day just to stay afloat. It’s also a cyclical industry and among the worst-hit in an economic downturn. Right now, there are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and no one knows for sure what the future holds. It might take years before normal air traffic resumes. To counter the impact of low air traffic, Air Canada has delayed capital expenditure this year. It has also targeted cost savings of $500 million in 2020. The Canadian airline has been running cargo flights to transport essential commodities and offset a part of the revenue decline. However, despite taking these steps, Air Canada, like most other peers, might need a bailout if lockdowns persist.
