Here’s BofA’s List of 4 Enterprise,"  Airline stocks were in a tailspin Monday, after Warren Buffett bailed on the industry. But there are signs of demand hitting bottom in the U.S., and markets in Asia may slowly rebound with new “travel bubbles” and “fast track” procedures underway. Buffett said Saturday that he had sold his entire stake in U.S. airline stocks through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.B).

3,Jim Cramer says Buffett's sale of airline stocks makes him 'very concerned about the near term',Jim Cramer says Buffett’s sale of airline stocks makes him ‘very concerned about the near term’. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Monday that legendary investor Warren Buffett gave “no hope near term” in his annual shareholders meeting on Saturday with his sale of airline stocks. “Buffett’s overview on airlines really does make me very concerned about the near term,” Cramer said on “Squawk on the Street.”  The billionaire investor said Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold all of its airline stocks because of the coronavirus pandemic. The conglomerate previously had investments in United, American, Southwest and Delta Airlines worth roughly $4 billion.  Airlines have been one of the major industries most impacted by the pandemic, which has slowed global travel to a trickle. Many airlines negotiated loans from the federal government and have been cutting flights across the country in an attempt to stem losses.  “The world has changed for the airlines. And I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,” Buffett said during the meeting.  Cramer said that he viewed Buffett bailing on airlines as a sign that there were serious issues in the broader economy.  “I think they very much are a microcosm of a big chunk of not the U.S. economy, if not the world economy in some cases, as he said,” Cramer said.  Major airline stocks were down sharply in early trading after Buffett’s announcement, with United, Delta and American all down more than 10%. American shares finished the session down 7.7%, while Delta was down 6.4% and United lost 5.1%. To be sure, Buffett was still bullish on the American economy long term.

Related Articles.","Quarantines and stay-at-home orders are starting to lift across the United States, with many locales preparing to reopen retail stores and restaurants for at least limited indoor operations. Airline carriers around the world hope that the worst is past, but as Warren Buffett's recent sales disclosure pointed out, not everyone is convinced that the travel industry will spring back to life in the next one or two quarters. Many analysts believe that travelers will stay away from airports in coming months, waiting to see if the lifting of restrictions triggers a dreaded ""second wave"" of infections. In addition, airlines are now implementing safe distancing in their fleets, lowering passenger capacity and revenues into the indefinite future. Plans to hike fares to make up for these lost seats could backfire, delaying a recovery that many smart folks expect will take two to three years. Airline stocks are trading close to March lows right now, despite strong bounces throughout the market universe, highlighting weak demand. It's no surprise because they brought exceptionally weak balance sheets into this crisis, pumping years of profits into buybacks and executive bonuses rather than building cash reserves, and the companies now need the government's help to survive. In turn, this raises the odds for secondary offerings that will dilute already depressed shares.  These poorly managed companies were weak market performers throughout the second half of the economic expansion, failing to reward shareholders, so any commentary insisting that the group will return to prior highs should be viewed with skepticism. More importantly, these issues can easily drop to new lows, continuing a bear market that might persist for months or years. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL) stock completed a round trip into the 2007 high in the lower $50s in 2014 and broke out a few months later, stalling in the mid-$70s. It completed a breakout above that level in the fourth quarter of 2018, but buying interest failed to develop, yielding dead sideways action ahead of a March 2020 breakdown that cut through support at the 2017 and 2016 lows. Price action since that time has failed to remount either barrier. The decline found support at the .786 Fibonacci rally retracement of the 2008 to 2018 uptrend, a common turning point after a major decline.

He made the comments during Berkshire’s annual shareholders’ meeting on Saturday. American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL), and United Continental Holdings (UAL) all dropped more than 12% on Monday, while Southwest Airlines (LUV) fell more than 8%. Berkshire picked up large positions in the airlines in late 2016, years after Buffett had sworn off buying an airline stock. In a departure from his normal practices, Buffett went into detail about transactions he made in April, which would normally be disclosed in an SEC 13-F regulatory filing several weeks after the close of the second quarter. Specifically, he said in April that Berkshire sold $6 billion worth of securities from its massive stock portfolio. “I wouldn’t normally talk about it, but I think it requires an explanation,” he said on Saturday. “We were not disappointed at all in the businesses that were being run and the management, but we did come to a different opinion on it.” Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines are among the industries being hurt by an exogenous shock “far beyond their control,” Buffett said. He later added that if Berkshire owned airlines now, “it would be a tough decision to decide whether to sustain billions of dollars in operating losses when you don’t know how long it’s going to happen or occur.” Buffett also suggested that the pandemic might also change consumer behavior long-term, pointing out that he hasn’t cut his hair in seven weeks and has been wearing a sweatsuit instead of a suit. “The world has changed for the airlines, and I don’t know how it’s changed, and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,” he said. “I don’t know whether the Americans will have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of an extended period if it happens that we’re semi shut down in the economy.”          The group offers","May 4, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-exits-airline-stocks-aal-ual-dal-luv-shares-fall-112121378.html

9,Here’s Why Warren Buffett Sold Airline Stocks,. . . . . . . . Here’s Why Warren Buffett Sold Airline Stocks. Berkshire Hathaway Bails on Airline,"By Rob Otman Originally posted May 5, 2020 Another insightful Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting has come and gone. And we got an answer to one big question. Why did Warren Buffett sell airline stocks? Berkshire sold its stakes in the top four U.S. airlines. That included the sale of Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), American Airlines (Nasdaq: AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) and United Airlines (Nasdaq: UAL). Beforehand, Warren Buffett’s company had owned roughly 10% of all four airlines’ stocks – so this was a big portfolio move. Before we jump into why this happened, it might be good to review some of Warren Buffett’s timeless wisdom from over the years. You can check out our list of more than 40 of the Top Warren Buffett Quotes. It’s packed with investing insight from Buffett’s many decades of investing success. Over the weekend, we gained some insight into the sale of the big airline stocks. Buffett said the world has changed for airlines. They have huge fixed costs, and due to decreased travel because of the coronavirus, they’re losing a lot of money.  To make ends meet in the short term, they’re taking on debt and issuing more stock at depressed levels. Overall, the future of flight traffic is too uncertain. Buffett still thinks the airline companies are run well. They have great management teams in place, although there’s less upside potential. Berkshire has come to terms with the new coronavirus market and has unloaded its airline stocks. In April, total Berkshire sales came in at about $6.5 billion. As a result, the holding company’s total cash pile has climbed even higher. It’s now at more than $130 billion. That’s a lot of cash sitting around, earning little interest. Warren Buffett would much rather invest it in great companies trading at lower valuations. Another statement from the shareholders meeting caught my eye. Warren Buffett said that Berkshire is willing to be a lender of last resort, but he hasn’t seen good enough deals come through. With the big sale of airline stocks, does Warren Buffett know something about the economy that we don’t know? Consumer spending makes up about 70% of GDP. And a sustained decrease in flying will hurt the economy on many levels. Warren Buffett is still reluctant to buy in the short term, although he continues to play the long game.

","  US stocks were set to fall on Monday as a US-Chinese spat about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak worsened while billionaire Warren Buffett's admission he had dumped his airline shares crushed major U.S. carriers. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines Co, Southwest Airlines Co and United Airlines fell between 9% and 11% in premarket, after Berkshire Hathaway chief Buffett told reporters of the move over the weekend, saying ""the world has changed"" for the industry. The comments, and fall in airline operators, also shaved more than 4.7% off planemaker Boeing Co's shares. Berkshire itself posted a record loss of nearly $50 billion and Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, said Buffett's relatively bleak reading of the market had hit home with investors. ""I did not get the sense that he sees an enormous amount of opportunity out there right now, but is instead holding up a very high level of cash,"" he said. On China, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese laboratory. An editorial in China's Global Times said Pompeo was ""bluffing"". The statements follow a grim start to May for Wall Street last week as President Donald Trump revived the threat of new tariffs against China in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""When you think how nervous markets got about the U.S.-China trade war then if this theme continues you can't help thinking that the end game is far worse than it would be from a simple trade war,"" said Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. The S&P 500 index's 29% recovery from its March lows stands to be tested as investors weigh renewed U.S.-China tensions and the economic damage of the health crisis. At 8:51 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 225 points, or 0.95%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 18.5 points, or 0.66% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 52.5 points, or 0.60%. Investors are also awaiting factory orders data for March, which is expected to show a sharp decline. With more than half of the S&P 500 companies having reported earnings so far, analysts now see first-quarter S&P 500 earnings falling 12.7% from a year ago, and an even sharper 37.8% decline for the second quarter.

Airline stocks tumble after Buffett bails on carriers 00:59 U.S. airlines posted considerable losses in the first quarter, and are on track for a dismal second quarter, as travel restrictions and government-mandated lockdowns across the world have brought demand to a virtual standstill. “The world has changed” for the aviation industry, Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday. American Airlines AAL.O has posted a $2.2 billion net loss, its first quarterly loss since emerging from bankruptcy in 2013, while United Airlines UAL.O reported a loss of $1.7 billion for its first quarter. Shares in Delta Air Lines DAL.N American Airlines and United Airlines fell more than 13% after the start of trading, but had pared losses by mid-morning. United was last down 6.9%, American was down 7.8% and Delta was down 8.5%. Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N had also pared losses and was last down 6.9% “Investors looking at the (airlines) group, are technicians, traders, people buying distress for fairly quick bounces,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive at investment adviser Horizon Investment Services LLC, which held Southwest shares until a month ago. “Long-term investors are saying ‘Do I want to sit with airline stocks, that may take four to five years for sustained moves upward, or put my money elsewhere,’” said Carlson. “They may feel some new opportunities have developed that are better than things they are holding and can rebound more quickly.” The S&P 1500 Airlines index .SPCOMAIR has lost 57.4% this year, compared with a 12.4% decline in the broader S&P 500 .SPX. Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said the worst is yet to come for the sector given that many airlines have cut capacity around 90% for April and May. “Until we get some clarity and stability from the global airline sector, we think it is hard to gauge how deep and wide this aerospace canyon is going to be,” Stallard said.

When Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold its entire stake"," When Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold its entire stake in the four largest US airlines in April, the writing on the wall was clear. It suggested that the aviation industry would not be able to sustain through the COVID-19 outbreak. Now, the ace investor has taken an even bigger and alarming step. His company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday (May 2) has sold all of its airline stocks.  This came as Berkshire Hathaway reported a net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first quarter amid the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a report from CNBC, the Berkshire Hathaway previously held shares of United Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Airlines, worth over $4 billion last December, but stocks were down this year by 69.7 per cent, 62.9 per cent, 45.8 per cent, and 58.7 per cent, respectively.   “It turned out I was wrong,” the ace investor said on Saturday at the company’s annual meeting adding that he’d made an understandable mistake given the unforeseen downturn in the industry. “The world has changed for airlines,” considering that the industry has been “really hurt by a forced shutdown” due to the coronavirus pandemic, he added.

17,Airline stocks plunge after Buffett dumps Berkshire Hathaway stake,. . Airline stocks plunge after Warren Buffett dumps Berkshire Hathaway stake. . MORE ON:. AIRLINES. Worker crushed to death," BUSINESS By Noah Manskar  May 4, 2020 | 1:16pm Airline stocks took a nosedive Monday after investing icon Warren Buffett said he dumped his company’s stake in the four major US carriers. Shares in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines each plunged at least 14 percent Monday after the billionaire Berkshire Hathaway boss said his conglomerate has completely abandoned its investments in them. Berkshire also ditched its stake in Southwest, whose shares dropped as much as 9.3 percent. Buffett suggested that the pandemic poses a long-term risk for airlines and questioned whether passengers will do as much flying once the crisis is over. Berkshire Hathaway previously owned 11 percent of Delta, 10 percent of American and Southwest, and 9 percent of United. “The world has changed for the airlines,” Buffett, 89, said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting, according to CNBC. “I don’t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.” American shares were off 10 percent at $9.57 as of 12:32 p.m., while United shares were down 9.4 percent at $24.10. Delta’s stock price was recently off 9.2 percent at $21.90 while Southwest’s had slipped 7.8 percent to $26.95. Buffett’s revelation was the latest sign of how the coronavirus crisis has kneecapped the global travel industry, which is reportedly trying to lay the groundwork for a recovery as some countries start to reopen their economies. The pandemic forced airlines to ground roughly two thirds of their planes as demand for flights dried up and countries imposed travel restrictions. Major carriers have also asked employees to take unpaid leave as they grapple with the financial impact of the crisis. Airlines have taken steps to prevent the spread of the virus as parts of Europe and the US begin to ease lockdowns aimed at curbing the pandemic, such as forcing passengers to wear face masks or blocking middle seats. But airlines still need to fill at least 70 percent of the seats on most flights to break even, Alexandre de Juniac of the International Air Transport Association told the Associated Press. Carriers could hike prices 50 percent if they have to remove or block many seats, he said. With Post wires READ NEXT Pork producers slowly bring back workers with partitions, ...
