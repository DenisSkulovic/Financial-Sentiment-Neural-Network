0,The Top 3 Airline ETFs to Watch,. . . . . . . . The Top 3 Airline ETFs to Watch. Airline ETF to Watch No.,"By Peter Bosworth Originally posted September 7, 2019 Updated on October 29 at 10:57 am  There are plenty of reasons to invest in airline ETFs. The airline industry is relatively undervalued, and with more people flying than ever before, the potential for growth is huge. Roughly 44,000 flights take off every day in the U.S. And last year, U.S. airports serviced around 1 billion passengers. Internationally, that number is closer to 4 billion. With fares becoming more affordable, airlines are serving more passengers and posting bigger profits The International Air Transport Association estimates the airline industry will net $35.5 billion in profit this year. They also project the number of passengers will increase to 8.2 billion by 2037. Airline ETFs are a great way to gain exposure to the growth of the airline industry. Plus, you aren’t vulnerable to the losses of any particular airline stock. On the whole, the airline industry has been tremendously profitable. In fact, it has been profitable for 10 straight years. And the airline industry should continue that profitable trend. Any investor would be wise to track the airline industry. And with airline ETFs you can maximize your exposure and minimize your risk. Specifically, these are the top 3 airline ETFs to watch in 2019: The iShares Transportation Average ETF tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average index, and a few other transportation stocks selected by the Dow Jones Average Committee. That means it has exposure to the railroad, freight, trucking and marine sectors in addition to the airline sector. The airline sector makes up about 18% of the ETF. The iShares Transportation Average ETF includes some of the best airline stocks around: Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK), United Airlines (Nasdaq: UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), American Airlines (Nasdaq: AAL) and JetBlue Airways (Nasdaq: JBLU). Since its inception in 2003 this ETF has outperformed the benchmark by 10%. With a low expense ratio and a large range of assets, the iShares Transportation Average ETF is a solid airline ETF. The U.S. Global Jets ETF is the only ETF that exclusively tracks airlines stocks. It’s a newer fund having only been on the market since April 30, 2015. This is the fund for you if you want to narrow your focus on airline companies like Delta or United. This ETF consists largely of airline company stocks, but also tracks aircraft manufacturers,","Sep 7, 2019",https://investmentu.com/top-3-airline-etfs-watch/

2,2 Stocks You Definitely Should Consider Shorting This Week - RealMoney,2 Stocks You Definitely Should Consider Shorting This Week. These 'bearish bets' are showing both technical and quantitative deterioration.. H&R,"Using recent actions and grades from TheStreet's Quant Ratings and layering on technical analysis of the charts of those stocks, Trifecta Stocks identifies five names each Friday that look bearish. While we will not be weighing in with fundamental analysis we hope this piece will give investors interested in stocks on the way down a good starting point to do further homework on the names.  H&R Block Inc. (HRB)  recently was downgraded to Hold with a C+ rating by TheStreet's Quant Ratings. This tax preparer got pounded last week on some massive volume. Since then, the stock has not been able to rally at all, telling us the big institutions are not involved here. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has a steep slope downward, money flow is poor and the cloud is red. This stock has more down to go, probably into the teens. This is a good short here.  JetBlue Airways Corp.  (JBLU)  recently was downgraded to Hold with a C+ rating by TheStreet's Quant Ratings. JetBlue is hurting, a good airline but just not getting the attention from the investing public. Money flow is weak, with the downtrend channel in place. This stock may rally up to the $17 area, but that would be a good spot to get short. Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is on a sell signal and the cloud is red. RSI is steep and sloping downward; this is another good short. This commentary is an excerpt from ""5 Bearish Bets"" a weekly feature sent to subscribers of Trifecta Stocks.
