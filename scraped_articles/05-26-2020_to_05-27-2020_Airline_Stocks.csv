2,Why Airline Stocks Are Flying Higher Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Stocks Are Flying Higher Today. Airlines are getting a lift from the broader market optimism that life is,"   Airline stocks are rocketing higher on Tuesday morning, joining in a broader market rally as investors celebrate signs economic activity is returning to normal and promising developments in the race for the COVID-19 vaccine. Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) led the way, up more than 14% as of 10 a.m. EDT, with shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) all up double digits. Airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with global travel demand reduced to nearly zero. The carriers have responded by slashing schedules, grounding planes, and cutting costs, with many major airlines flying only about 5% of their original schedules in May. The cost cuts, coupled with government assistance as part of the CARES Act stimulus plan and private fundraising efforts, have bought the airlines time. But no airline can survive indefinitely with little revenue coming in, and the sector is going to need to see travel start to normalize in the months to come to avoid liquidity issues. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Investors saw signs of normalization over the Memorial Day weekend in the U.S., with crowds flocking to beaches and other traditional vacation sites. The pandemic is far from over, and in fact it is possible all that travel could lead to a spike in future cases, but there was also good news regarding the development of COVID treatments and vaccines from Merck and Novavax. Airline investors have other green shoots to encourage them. German carrier Lufthansa is nearing an assistance package that should help it fly through the crisis, which is an incremental positive for its U.S. partner, United. And Southwest was upgraded at UBS from neutral to buy, with analyst Myles Walton saying the path for a domestic recovery is becoming more clear. Most of these airline stocks lost more than half of their value in the early days of the pandemic, with investors fearful the sector was facing a wave of bankruptcies. Globally we have seen airlines go bankrupt, including two of the largest airlines in South America, but the U.S. industry entered the downturn in better financial shape than most and so far has managed through the crisis well. For investors, it is pretty straightforward from here: If demand does return to even more normal recessionary","May 26, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/26/why-airline-stocks-are-flying-higher-today.aspx
3,Airline Stocks Take Off Amid Early Signs of a Recovery  | Barron's,Airline Stocks Take Off Amid Early Signs of a Recovery. One measure the TSA didn’t require was vacant middle seats..,"  Airline stocks are soaring on a number of positive signals for the industry, including an easing of some travel bans in Europe, improvements in passenger traffic, and new screening rules in the U.S. that could bolster confidence in air travel. The NYSE Arca Airline Index was up 9% amid a rally that saw the S&P 500 gaining about 2% in early trading. Some of the hardest-hit airline stocks were surging, including United Airlines Holdings (ticker: UAL), up 12%, and Spirit Airlines (SAVE), up 14.6%. UBS analyst Myles Walton, meanwhile, upgraded his rating on Southwest Airlines (LUV) to Buy from Neutral, and increased his price target to $41 from $37, writing that the airline offers the “best risk/reward” to play a recovery. His price target implies a 28% upside from recent prices around $32. Positive news keeps trickling out for the industry. Deutsche Lufthansa (LHA.Germany), the second largest airline in Europe, received a bailout package worth 9 billion euros (about $9.8 billion) from the German government. The deal gives the government a 20% stake in the airline and two supervisory board seats, and it could be positive for U.S. airlines such as United, which has a flight-sharing deal with Lufthsana. Some European countries are easing travel restrictions. Italy plans to allow travel between select European countries starting June 3. Germany and Greece plan to reopen their borders on June 15, and Spanish government officials have said the country will reopen to foreign tourists in July, ending requirements for a two-week quarantine period for travelers. In the U.S., the Transportation Security Administration announced new health-safety measures, aiming to increase social distancing and reduce touch points. Starting in June, passengers will be able to hold on to their boarding passes, rather than handing them to attendants. Food must be kept in a clear plastic bag for screening—reducing chances of an inspection. The TSA also said it would try to resolve security alarms by having passengers go through rescreening and handle items themselves. Security personnel must now wear masks and gloves, and the agency said that it would increase social-distancing requirements in security lines. One measure the TSA didn’t require was vacant middle seats. Those seats have become controversial—some airlines are blocking them, others are limiting seat inventory or allowing passengers to rebook their flight if a plane is nearly full. Moreover, the TSA didn’t require temperature screening of passengers, something that","May 26, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-stocks-take-off-amid-early-signs-of-a-recovery-51590508272

6,Airline Stocks Shot Up Today - Why's That? - Simple Flying,Airline Stocks Shot Up Today – Why’s That?. A good day on the markets. Passengers beginning to move again. A," Amid optimism about the economy re-opening faster than expected and with forward bookings picking up, shares in US airlines shot up today on the back of broader stock market gains. Analysts believe its also a sign the markets are normalizing in response to altered business conditions. American Airlines (AAL) rose 14.85% today to close at US$11.14, United Airlines (UAL) finished the day 16.3% up to close at US$29.54, Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 13.05% to close at US$25.65, and Southwest Airlines (LUV) climbed 12.6% today to close at US$32.52. Airline stocks significantly outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average increase of 2.2%. But, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq have all increased by an average of 30% since their March lows. Beleaguered airlines are beginning to see passengers book flights again, not just for immediate travel but also forward travel. Cancelations have also declined. Passengers traveling through TSA checkpoints nationwide fell to a low of 87,534 in mid-April. By Sunday, passenger numbers had tripled to 267,451. That’s still down 87% on 12 months prior, but it is a sign people are beginning to fly again. “It would be hard to argue that traffic is going to come back and normalize in the next few months, but there are signs that we may be past the worst,” Adrian Yanoshik, an aviation analyst at Berenberg Bank told the Wall Street Journal today. American Airlines flights are now running at about 35% capacity, compared with 15% in April. Southwest’s flights are around 30% full, up significantly on their May expectations of 10%. Both Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have said they will be adding capacity over the northern hemisphere summer. In addition to the sense of normalization and the belief that the worst may be over, the uptick in travelers prepared to hit the purchase button on travel websites can also be attributed to signs some border restrictions are easing. For example, Hong Kong will gradually allow passengers to transit through the busy hub from June 1. Singapore will also begin unwinding bans on transit traffic from June 2. Spain plans to lift an automatic two-week quarantine for incoming foreign travelers from July 1. The markets are also reassured by the level of government support for airlines. The CARES Act is providing US$32 billion for US airlines, including US$25 billion for US passenger airlines. As a result, the big","May 26, 2020",https://simpleflying.com/airline-stocks-rise/

BTC-USD.,"                                                   Investors continue to pour money into airline stocks as the government eases COVID-19-related lockdown measures, which in turn is boosting air travel. In fact, many U.S. states lifted restrictions imposed to counter the spread of the virus just in time for the Memorial Day holiday weekend.   STR senior vice president Jan Freitag added that “all 50 states have at least partially reopened, so slow weekly demand growth should continue with more leisure activity around the country.”   Talking about air travel, data from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) showed that daily average of travelers that went through TSA checkpoints during the week ended May 23 increased to 262,734, the highest since the week ended Mar 28. And on May 22, ahead of the Memorial Day weekend, 348,673 travelers passed TSA checkpoints, the highest since Mar 22 and four times higher than the lows of 87,000 hit in mid-April.    By the way, airlines’ improved cash flow and cost-control measures helped them with enough capital to tide over the crisis, and now with improved traffic, things are certainly looking up for airliners. Notably, airlines have always done well during a crisis. For instance, in the six months following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2008-09 financial crisis, airline stocks surged around 80% to 120%.   Lest we forget, the government is currently helping airliners stay afloat amid the pandemic. In a positive move, the U.S. Treasury Department and major U.S. airlines reached an agreement on principle aimed at curtailing layoffs. Notably, 10 of the top 12 U.S. carriers have agreed to accept federal aid in exchange for allowing the department to have a small ownership stake.   In other words, the grant will include a mix of cash and loan, with the government getting warrants from carriers that can be converted into small ownership stakes in some of the leading airlines. The major carriers, in fact, will receive 70% of the funds in cash that need not be paid back. But the rest 30% of the assistance needs to","May 27, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-airline-stocks-10-coronavirus-120412995.html

Markets bounce back as hopes rise for economic recovery as lockdowns are,"  Shares in Aer Lingus parent International Airlines Group soared 22 per cent on Tuesday. Photograph: Frank Grealish Investors were buoyed on Tuesday by easing fears in relation to the coronavirus pandemic and the potential for economics and businesses to get back to work. Euronext Dublin finished up 2.5 per cent on Tuesday, while there were major gains for airlines, banks and construction companies. Two of the pillar banks were strong performers on the day as traders noted Bank of Ireland surged “a whopping” 13.5 per cent, while AIB climbed 10 per cent. One trader pointed out that, for many months, the two banks had been “underperformers in an underperforming sector”. The aviation industry, which has been hammered by the pandemic, also bounced back. Ryanair saw its share price increase by 12 per cent but the airline lagged a number of its rivals as Aer Lingus parent International Airlines Group soared 22 per cent, while Easyjet climbed 20 per cent. The positive sentiment in relation to the pandemic spread to the hotel sector as Dalata – Ireland’s biggest hotel operator – saw its shares advance 11 per cent. On the home-building front, Glenveagh Properties and Cairn Homes were both up 5 per cent, while building material suppliers Grafton Group and Kingspan were up 6 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Elsewhere, shares in Swiss-Irish baked foods company Aryzta rose 10 per cent despite the company earlier reporting a 24 per cent reduction in revenue in the third quarter of its financial year. The Ftse 100 index gained 1.2 per cent, while the more domestic-focused Ftse 250 climbed 3.3 per cent as the UK market reopened after a bank holiday.

11,Warren Buffett dumped the 'big 4' airline stocks in April. They've already recovered from the sell-off he sparked. | Markets Insider,. Warren Buffett dumped the 'big 4' airline stocks in April. They've already recovered from the sell-off he sparked.. 'The,"   Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc  Warren Buffett revealed at the start of May that he'd dumped the ""big four"" airlines in April, sending their stocks into freefall. They've bounced back in less than a month as investors bet the ""Oracle of Omaha"" made a bad call. Shares in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines jumped last week on coronavirus vaccine hopes, then soared more than 12% on Tuesday after a raft of positive news. All four were up more than 7% in pre-market trading as of 7:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The stocks have now erased their losses since Buffett announced his sales, and trade higher than their average price in April, meaning they could be worth more now than when Buffett sold them.  It's worth revisiting why Buffett ditched the ""big four"" airlines, and what has happened since then to justify the recent rally. Read More: Billionaire and legendary investor David Booth: Here's how to invest smartly right now so you come out of the pandemic with financial security Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate owned between 8% and 11% of the ""big four"" airlines before it ditched those positions in April. The billionaire investor announced the sales and explained them at Berkshire's shareholder meeting earlier this month. His main argument was that the investment case for the airlines has changed significantly. He questioned whether passenger numbers would fully rebound from the coronavirus pandemic in the next few years. Even if carriers returned to 80% of their capacity, he warned, they could be left with ""too many planes."" Buffett also pointed to the billions of dollars in government loans taken by the carriers, which they will have to repay out of their earnings. He added that shareholders will also lose out from the the stock warrants that the airlines handed to the government, which it can exercise to buy their shares at a discount in the future.

With the U.S. making more progress towards opening the economy and more companies making positive progress on vaccine development, investors are feeling more confident about buying stocks. On Mad Money, Jim Cramer looked at the rally and asks, will this turn out to be a V-shaped recession and recovery after all? TheStreet's Katherine Ross spoke with Cramer yesterday about Regeneron being the coronavirus vaccine stock to buy over Merck, avoiding airline stocks for now and being careful picking which stocks to buy during the coronavirus pandemic. Is now the best time to buy Regeneron  (REGN) - Get Report stock after it fell almost 25 points yesterday? Yesterday, Sanofi announced it was selling its long-standing stake in Regeneron and sent the stock down 4%. Sanofi is going to focus its efforts on cancer treatment drugs. Cramer has a strong recommendation for Regeneron after the stock fell yesterday. Are you looking for other stocks to buy at a discount? You might want to look in a different sector than the airline industry. Airline stocks were soaring almost 16% yesterday after it was announced that they would start easing restrictions on flights. Will that be enough of a catalyst to get frequent flyers back in the air? Cramer is not convinced and shared his thoughts on buying airline stocks now. The worst part of the coronavirus pandemic and our time in quarantine has been the unknown. While picking stocks has also ventured into the territory of the unknown, combining the two might be something to avoid until we start getting more clarity.

14,Here’s why Warren Buffett made a huge mistake selling his airline stocks | The WealthAdvisor,. . . . . . Here’s why Warren Buffett made a huge mistake selling his airline stocks. . .,"  There’s a big debate now about whether Warren Buffett has “lost his touch.” I’m not sure, but here’s one group of people that has little doubt: airline sector insiders. While Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.45% BRK.B, -0.00% booked substantial losses dumping airlines stocks in the late first-quarter weakness in the sector, insiders at close to half a dozen airlines bought lots of their stock — including the airlines Berkshire sold. Read: Warren Buffett has lost at least $7 billion from his last 3 big investments In a direct challenge to the Oracle of Omaha, insiders racked up the kind of sector-wide buying I look for to support a bullish industry call in my stock newsletter Brush Up on Stocks. Money managers invested in airline stocks say that three key factors explain airline insider bullishness: 1. Government to the rescue: Politicians see the airline sector as a cornerstone of U.S. economic security. Moreover, airlines and related businesses employ a lot of people. So the federal government readily approved $50 billion in support.  One in 15 jobs is airline-related if you include hospitality, says Frank Holmes, CEO of U.S. Global Investors, which manages the U.S. Global Jets JETS, -1.58% exchange-traded fund. “There is big multiplier effect in the airline industry. That is why politicians supported the package.” 2. Travel is coming back: The number of airline passengers screened per day has risen to around 200,000 from lows of 87,000 in mid-April. This offers “flickers of hope” for the group, says Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth. While still low, travel statistics are heading in the right direction, Syth says.  As travel picks up, the benefits of airline sector consolidation will kick in again, adds Samantha McLemore, a portfolio manager at Miller Opportunity Trust Fund. Airlines have inherently higher return on capital and cash flows because of improved cost controls and pricing power. Airlines also have been able to raise capital during this crisis so they will be able to “fund their way through this” as traffic improves, she says.  3. Airline stocks did well after the last three financial crises: In the six months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 2003 SARS outbreak, and the 2008-09 financial crisis, airline stocks rose 80%-120%, Holmes points out.

How Creativity Became Essential To,"A Southwest Airlines jet taxis at Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma, New York, U.S., Jan. ... [+] Warren Buffett famously advised “be greedy when others are fearful”, and I think he should follow his own advice – assuming he is still a long-term investor. Those overlooking Southwest Airlines Company (LUV), Warren Buffett included, are in the Danger Zone. Those willing to see through the dip should consider adding this Long Idea to their portfolios. Best in Business Poised for Long-Term Growth LUV is not only undervalued relative to the S&P 500, but its underlying business is also strong and poised to rebound after the dip. I first made LUV a Long Idea in July 2016. Since then, LUV has underperformed the market, but, given its steep decline in 2020, LUV now presents an even better buying opportunity. Warren Buffett recently made headlines at Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A) annual shareholder meeting when he disclosed the firm sold its shares in the four largest U.S. airlines, citing that “the world changed for airlines”. While no one can argue with Buffett’s statement in the short term, i.e. 6-12 months, I disagree over the long term. Anything better than a worst-case scenario and LUV presents an excellent risk/reward at its current price. PROMOTED In addition to the advantages outlined in my original report (largest domestic operator, superior record of profitability, smart investments in technology), LUV has a very strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and is the only U.S. airline to receive an “investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies,” which increases its flexibility to raise additional capital should the need arise. There will be some carnage in the airline industry, but LUV is best-positioned not only to survive, but also to further widen its advantages over the competition. LUV’s History of Profit Growth LUV has a strong history of generating consistent profits. Since 2009, LUV has grown revenue by 8% compounded annually and core earnings[1] by 43% compounded annually, per Figure 1. Longer term, LUV has grown core earnings by 8% compounded annually over the past two decades. The firm increased its core earnings margin from 1% in 2009 to 9% in the trailing-twelve-month period (TTM).

16,Is It Time to Buy Southwest Airlines Stock?,Is It Time to Buy Southwest Airlines Stock?. . LUV Long-Term Chart (1991 – 2020). LUV Short-Term Chart (2017 –,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) stock has surged off its May 14 six-year low in reaction to improved bookings, triggering a wave of bottoming calls, but is now the right time to take exposure in the damaged airline sector? The answer depends on time frame and stomach acids because new shareholders are likely to suffer through sleepless nights until the threat of a second pandemic wave passes in the spring of 2021. The short-term uptick has now reached the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) in the low $30s, which was broken on heavy volume in February. In turn, this is a perfect location to watch the bull/bear conflict, looking for relative strength clues that could predict future price action. A volume uptick and breakout right here could be instructive, setting off buy signals for bottom fishers, while a reversal could easily reach the March low. Despite the increase in bookings, the company still expects May 2020 operating revenues to fall 85% to 90% year over year and bookings to decrease between 60% and 70%. This marks an improvement over prior guidance, but it's not enough to stop the red ink because thin margins and years of stock buybacks have weakened the carrier's balance sheet. Legendary investor Warren Buffet has taken note of the shortfall, selling airline holdings including his Southwest shares. A 1991 breakout above six-year resistance at a split-adjusted $1.37 attracted widespread buying interest, establishing an uptrend that stalled at $7.72 in 1994. The stock cleared that obstacle in 1998, splitting three times into the January 2001 top at $23.34. That marked the highest high for the next 13 years, ahead of a persistent but shallow decline that held support near $11 into a breakdown during the 2008 economic collapse. The sell-off found support at a 12-year low in the deep single digits in the first quarter of 2009, finally ending the eight-year uptrend. The subsequent recovery wave stalled in the lower teens in 2010, yielding a successful 2011 retest that completed a bullish double bottom reversal. The stock broke out above a 12-year trendline of lower highs less than two years later, entering the strongest advance so far this century. The rally reached the 2001 high in 2014, yielding an immediate breakout that finally stalled in the mid-$40s in 2015. The subsequent correction ended in a fresh breakout after the 2016 presidential election, lifting the stock to an all-time","May 27, 2020",https://www.investopedia.com/is-it-time-to-buy-southwest-airlines-stock-4846170

Most popular,"British Airways owner IAG and easyJet among those to rise as retail stocks also make gains  Global financial markets have rallied on rising hopes for a coronavirus vaccine and a smooth recovery for the world economy as governments gradually ease lockdown restrictions. In the UK the FTSE 100 rose by 1.2% or 74 points as countries around the world begin the lengthy task of reopening their economies as the health emergency shows signs of gradually easing.  Airline company stocks, holiday firms, pubs and cinema groups were among the biggest risers on London’s stock market on Tuesday, after Boris Johnson signalled plans to further lift restrictions on high street shops from next week. Shares on Wall Street were up more than 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained almost 600 points, hitting more than 25,000 in early afternoon trading in New York as investors bet on a swift global rebound from the Covid-19 crisis. The S&P 500 index of leading American company shares rose above 3,000 for the first time since March, as stocks gradually regain ground lost during the sharpest market crash in a generation suffered at the onset of the pandemic. Investors in the London stock market were boosted by the prime minister setting out a timeline for the reopening of outdoor markets and car showrooms in England from 1 June. High street shops, department stores and shopping centres will all be allowed to open from 15 June as long as they can show they are “Covid secure”, the prime minister said on Monday. Analysts said updates from pharmaceutical companies working to develop Covid-19 vaccines were also encouraging investors to push share prices higher, despite the extensive economic damage caused by lockdown controls and fears that no vaccine will be found.
