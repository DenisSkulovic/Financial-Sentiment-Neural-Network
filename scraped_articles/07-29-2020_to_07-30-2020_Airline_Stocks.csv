DAL, AAL, UAL: Airline stocks in the time of the coronavirus.","follow us... Even the darkest of clouds can have significant silver linings. This coronavirus craziness has managed to bring some great opportunities; but only if we are bold enough to recognize and seize them. There is no doubt that the United States and the rest of the world are on their knees because of the coronavirus pandemic. Even the mighty president of the United States has been forced to accept the gravity of the situation after months of downplaying it for the sake of the economy. Indeed, many industries have been affected. Among the most negatively impacted is the tourism industry, which is composed of hotels, resorts, and even transportation businesses such as airlines.   Needless to say, even major airlines are experiencing significant losses. American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) reports to have lost around $100 million per day in April because it halted its operations because of the widespread lockdowns imposed at that time. Other airlines such as Delta (DAL) and United (NASDAQ: UAL) report similar stories. Even so, analysts are quite positive regarding the viability of the airline stocks. In this article, we try to see why. These stocks are cheap
Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL) stock has underperformed together with those of other airlines. As mentioned, this resulted in tremendous losses to the companies. But this might bring a huge opportunity to investors, though such an opportunity comes with a considerably high risk. Because the stocks are priced more cheaply than before, investors can acquire more and reap a lot later when the companies are back on their feet.  Will they ever be back? If we listen to analysts who make financial projections for us, they will definitely be. And the wait is not going to be that long. We talk more about this in the next point. The world economy will eventually reopen
Many businesses have been forced to shut down because of the pandemic. Many owners lost their livelihood and many workers lost their jobs. But out of all this chaos the world will eventually emerge. Governments will soon find ways to work around the virus, which by the way, is predicted to stay for a long while. The world will have to learn to live with the virus, ushering in a new way of living that has been dubbed the “new normal.” When will this new normal be?

2,Why You'd Be Smart to Buy Southwest Airlines | The Motley Fool,Why You'd Be Smart to Buy Southwest Airlines. Here are three key takeaways from the airline's second-quarter earnings.. Reduced cash,"   Just when the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to be behind us and things were looking up in June, a surge in cases across several key states has underscored the harsh reality that the pandemic is far from over. The second climb in cases has affected families across the United States who are concerned about schools reopening, wondering when life will get back to normal, and deciding whether it's safe enough to take a summer vacation. As a result of rising cases, airlines have seen a plateau in demand, which is pressuring airlines to dig in and prepare for a long recovery. Although the industry is hurting, there are a few good reasons why you'd be smart to buy the industry leader, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), for the long term. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES With airlines losing money, the primary focus for an industry recovery has been to reduce daily cash burn as much as possible. The numbers were bad in April, with American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) spending $100 million per day at one point and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) expecting $70 million in cash burn per day in the second quarter. Estimates have since come down, but cash burn remains a serious concern. Southwest originally estimated it would go through $30 million to $35 million per day in the second quarter, but then revised that estimate to $20 million to $25 million. It ended up using up $23 million per day on average and only $16 million per day in June. Unfortunately, it expects an average cash burn rate in July of $18 million and an average third-quarter burn rate of $23 million per day, the same as the second quarter. To be fair, this is a fairly pessimistic outlook from Southwest, seeing as the company would need to burn around $25 million per day in August and September to get to its forecast for the quarter.  The key takeaway is that Southwest's cash burn has improved substantially from earlier in the year thanks to a rise in air traffic and $7 billion in reduced spending for the year. The company also demonstrated how quickly things can improve even with a slight increase in air traffic, as we saw in June.  It's hard to argue that Southwest has anything short of the best balance sheet in the industry. Southwest's CFO, Tammy Romo, noted during","Jul 30, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/30/why-youd-be-smart-to-buy-southwest-airlines.aspx

The fund posted a return of -15.4% for the quarter (net of fees), underperforming its benchmark, the S&P 500 Index which returned 20.5% in the same quarter. However, you should check out McLain Capital's top 5 stock picks for investors to buy right now, which could be the biggest winners of the stock market crash. In the said letter, McLain Capital highlighted a few stocks and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) is one of them. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) is an airline company. Year-to-date, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) stock lost 59.0% and on July 28th it had a closing price of $11.77. Here is what McLain Capital said: ""American Airlines (AAL) : With a $6.5bln market cap & adjusting for the current cash burn & incremental net debt, American currently trades at a higher pro-forma enterprise value than it did at the beginning of the year, while revenues are off 80-90%. The two year notes, AAL 5% 6/2022, currently trade 52 cents on the dollar at a yield to maturity of 46%, implying zero equity value for the common stock. At it’s current projected pace of cash burn, the company will expend its current liquidity before year end. American is one of the most popular stocks among retail investors."" In Q1 2020, the number of bullish hedge fund positions on American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) stock decreased by about 12% from the previous quarter (see the chart here), so a number of other hedge fund managers believe in American Airlines' downside potential.

4,Is Southwest Airlines Co.'s (NYSE:LUV) Stock Price Struggling As A Result Of Its Mixed Financials?,. . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD.,"                                                   Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has had a rough month with its share price down 9.3%. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. In this article, we decided to focus on Southwest Airlines' ROE. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Southwest Airlines is: 1.5% = US$163m ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2020). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.01 in profit. Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. It is hard to argue that Southwest Airlines' ROE is much good in and of itself. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 12%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Therefore, Southwest Airlines' flat earnings over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors.

7,Warren Buffett is Betting on Banks: Should You Buy RBC (TSX:RY)?,. . . . . . . . Warren Buffett Is Betting on Banks: Should You Buy RBC (TSX:RY)?. Bullish,"      Adam Othman | July 30, 2020 | More on: BAC RY RY 2020 has not been a good year for anybody. Investors have seen losses they could not have anticipated, and even the Oracle of Omaha has suffered substantial losses amid the pandemic-fueled market correction. Warren Buffett sold his entire position in airline stocks with the onset of the market crash during the pandemic. For the first time in decades as an investor, Buffett became a net seller. He bought more Delta Airlines shares before the pandemic before deciding to let go of all the airline companies he bought. Additionally, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway also saw an extensive $50 billion net loss in its first quarter of fiscal 2020. The king of the investing world has since laid low, and the only major purchase has been his investment in Dominion Energy’s infrastructure for $10 billion. Buffett has been uncharacteristically quiet since the acquisition, but he has since made another move. On July 23, 2020, we got a hint of what Buffett might be up to. The investor purchased an additional $800 million worth of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock. The recent move changed his position to owning 11.3% of the bank. The fact that Buffett doubled down on the stock, despite the issues that come with owning a significant position in a bank, is an indicator that he is confident in the company. Why does he have such a bullish stance on the bank? Buffett said that banks would not be the primary casualty of the recession due to the global health crisis. He believes that the robust capitalization of major financial institutions will help banks ride the wave. If we consider the recent revenues generated by big banks, he might not be off. While most banks are posting a significant decline in net income, it is primarily due to an increase in provisions for credit losses (PCLs). Banks put aside PCLs in anticipation of losses occurring from loan defaulters. If the losses do not materialize, banks can reverse the PCLs. Bank of America posted almost a 50% decline in pre-tax income in Q1 2020. However, that was mainly due to a substantial increase in PCLs. If you consider the revenue without considering its PCLs, the bank actually saw a 6% increase in deposits with an 8% jump in revenue from the previous quarter.

Covid-19: Singapore Airlines raises additional $750 million, brings total","SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Shares of Singapore Airlines (SIA) fell to their lowest in more than 21 years on Thursday (July 30) after the carrier posted its biggest quarterly loss ever as the coronavirus wiped out travel demand. The shares fell as much as 5.1 per cent to $3.35, the lowest intraday price since September 1998, before paring to $3.40 as of 1.44pm in Singapore. The stock, which has declined by almost half this year, was among the worst performers on Thursday on a Bloomberg gauge of carriers in the Asia-Pacific region. Air traffic the world over has plunged because the pandemic led to tight border controls and a reluctance to travel. The International Air Transport Association said on Tuesday the airline industry is unlikely to recover fully before 2024. The situation is particularly difficult for carriers like Singapore Airlines that have no domestic market to cushion the blow. SIA's net loss in the three months through June was $1.12 billion, compared with net income of $111 million a year earlier. Sales dropped 79 per cent to $851 million, and traffic measured by revenue passenger per kilometre sank 99.5 per cent. CGS-CIMB analyst Raymond Yap cut his recommendation on SIA to hold from add following the results. He has a $3.55 price target on the stock. SIA said on Wednesday its passenger capacity still may be less than half of pre-coronavirus levels by the end of its fiscal year next March. The airline also said it is reviewing its network to determine the size and mix of its fleet over the longer term. The review, which should be completed by the end of this quarter, could lead to a material impairment of about $1 billion on the carrying values of older generation aircraft, particularly Airbus SE A380s, SIA said. The carrier's fuel hedging policy led to a $535 million loss in the quarter, while there was also a $127 million hit from the liquidation of NokScoot Airlines. SIA owned a 49 per cent stake in the low-cost Thai carrier that collapsed in June. SIA was operating only to 24 cities by the end of June.

Boeing Posts Wider Q2 Loss on COVID-19,"Spirit Airlines  (SAVE) - Get Report is prepping to furlough as much as 30% of its workforce in October, making it the first low-cost U.S. carrier to implement job cuts due to the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact on the airline industry. According to an internal memo seen by Reuters, the Miramar, Fla.-based carrier will be informing unions of its plans as early as this Friday. “It’s now clear that the demand increase we saw in June was an outlier, and the downward trend will continue,” CEO Ted Christie said in the memo, adding that the airline’s expected daily cash burn of more than $100 million per month in the coming months “is not sustainable.” ""The health crisis, loss of demand, and corresponding economic impact caused by Covid-19 is unprecedented,"" Christie said.

Jul 2020 PDF download (GERMAN) “BEACH” Stocks - Ready for a Rebound? COVID-19 has become world’s No.1 enemy and has pushed the global economy over the edge. Since the Wuhan lockdown that was imposed on January 23, the MSCI World Index of global stocks is still down more than 5%. Cases of newly infected people are reported daily and at the moment the numbers are approaching 230k persons per day. Many economies have suffered tremendous losses and are still facing rigid restrictions in order to constrain the spread of the virus. In other words, the COVID-19 pandemic has turned the economy upside down. Some of the stocks that have been hit the hardest are the so-called “BEACH” stocks (Booking, Entertainment and Live Events, Airlines, Cruises and Casinos, Hotels and Resorts). These stocks have seen more than USD 332 billion in value evaporate over the past few months. But what happened with seasonal effects during these difficult times? Have they been erased? Or are stocks still displaying their well-known seasonal patterns? In this issue of Seasonal Insights I will discuss two different stocks that represent cruise lines and the airline industry and show their seasonal patterns in the course of a calendar year. Will the ""BEACH"" stocks make a comeback? As many readers probably know, seasonal effects are predictable patterns that recur almost every year.
These effects serve to determine whether a short or long position in certain stocks is statistically highly likely to be profitable. The best-known seasonal drivers include investor sentiment at certain times of the year, tax or balance sheet deadlines, earning reports, the timing of interest payments or the weather, to name but a few of the factors affecting the stock prices of various companies.

× For four months, social distancing measures have hobbled the airline industry with depressed demand, grounded flights, and net losses. Ridership remains low, held down by travel prohibitions between countries that normally supply heavily trafficked routes. With persistent losses and pessimistic future forecasts, several European airlines have now received aid from their governments to maintain solvency for those companies critical to industry supply chains. In March 2020, industry-wide revenue for passenger air fare dropped to nearly half the revenues a year prior. The dramatic shock, in an industry characterized by high fixed costs with little room for volatile revenues, immediately required interventions from governments around the world. For many privately owned air carriers, these interventions, typically in the form of tax reductions and payroll support, provided quick relief.  While some countries have stopped there, the United States and some countries in Europe have used the temporary relief provided by payroll support subsidies to negotiate more complex deals for aid in exchange for equity or warrants. By late April, many European airlines negotiated some form of aid from their home country governments; now two more airlines join the group, with an additional $10 billion in credit guarantees, state loans, and capital investment.
