0,Is Now a Good Time to Buy Airline Stocks?,. . . . . . . . Is Now a Good Time to Buy Airline Stocks?. The case for,"      Adam Othman | June 13, 2020 | More on: AC CHR Airline stocks have suffered more than almost any other industry in this pandemic. Air Canada (TSX:AC) is still bleeding over $20 million a day, and operating on a mere fraction of its total capacity. But after some of the slowest weeks in the company’s history, the stock has finally seen some action and has pushed past the $20 price tag. Similarly, Chorus Aviation (TSX:CHR) has also seen a relatively strong month, and the stock grew by about 35%. While both companies are trading way below their pre-crash values, the current rally and budding optimism surrounding the industry might be powerful enough to revert the direction of the stock movement — for good this time. Does that make it a good time to buy airline stocks? Air Canada has shown great resilience during this pandemic. The company refused to go down and took some harsh steps to stay operational. That included laying off half the staff. It has also grounded most of its fleet, issued bonds and stocks to raise cash, and cut its aircraft deal with Boeing. But the company isn’t backing out of its Transat deal, which will solidify its commercial air superiority in the country. Air Canada is on the road to recovery, but that recovery may not be as swift as some investors might expect. The company itself put its prospects of reaching pre-crash levels three years in the future. The real timeline might actually be even further in the future. And even if the company starts operating at its full capacity, there is no guarantee that the stock will be as strong as before or grow as rapidly as it did before the crash. If you are willing to hold on to this growth stock for at least five years before seeing any substantial returns, then now may be a very good time to buy. Another airline stock that investors might want to consider is Chorus Aviation. It’s a smaller stock compared to Air Canada, with a current market cap of just $628 million. The company has accumulated $2 billion in debt and is currently holding on to just $90 million in cash, which doesn’t paint a very flattering picture of its short-term prospects. However, its net property and equipment seem sizeable enough to cover its long-term debts. Chorus","Jun 13, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/06/13/is-now-a-good-time-to-buy-airline-stocks/
1,American Airlines Stock Jumps 16% as Management Finally Shares Some Good News | The Motley Fool,American Airlines Stock Jumps 16% as Management Finally Shares Some Good News. Cash burn is improving a bit faster than,"   June has been an extremely volatile period for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock. Shares of the U.S. airline giant soared in the first week of the month, including a bizarre 41% surge on June 4. The stock then gave up some of its gains over the past week, plummeting 29% over a three-day period from Tuesday to Thursday. American Airlines stock was on the move again on Friday, following a bullish investor update. The shares rallied 16% to end the week at $16.74.  DATA SOURCE: YCHARTS. In contrast to the prior week's rally, at least there was some meaningful positive news to justify American Airlines stock's big gain on Friday. Nevertheless, investors appear to be too optimistic about the company's medium- and long-term prospects. The massive rally in American Airlines stock on June 4 was sparked by a press release indicating that the carrier planned to restore 55% of its normal domestic schedule in July: up from just 20% to 25% in May. This seemed to confirm a growing belief among investors that air travel demand is rebounding rapidly from the coronavirus-induced downturn. That said, just a week earlier, management had reiterated its guidance for the second quarter, calling for daily cash burn to average $70 million during the period (excluding payroll support funds provided under the CARES Act). This implied total cash burn of more than $6 billion in the current quarter alone. Thus, improving traffic results didn't seem to be helping the bottom line. On Friday, American Airlines provided another investor update. The airline disclosed that its load factor improved sequentially in the first eight days of June relative to May, even as it began to restore some capacity. Management also said that net bookings have been positive since mid-May across all parts of the booking curve (i.e. both last-minute purchases and bookings for travel months from now). Most importantly, management noted that cash burn was on track to moderate to $40 million per day in June, compared to its original estimate of $50 million per day for the final month of the quarter. That's a significant, tangible improvement -- although it means the company is still burning more than $1 billion of cash each month. Management hopes to reduce cash burn to zero by year-end.

3,Don't Buy Into the Recent Rally in AAL Stock | InvestorPlace,Don’t Buy Into the Recent Rally in American Airlines Stock. AAL stock's recent gains won't last long considering its massive," Airline stocks are surging off March lows after an uptick in demand for air travel as the U.S., and other countries have started to ease lockdown restrictions. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) announced that it was resuming a sizable number of flights in July due to the increased demand. As a result, AAL stock has jumped 37% in the past two weeks. Is the increase justified? It’s true that American is adding back some capacity for the summer, but that is expected to be only 55% of the level in July 2019. Moreover, with social distancing and other preventive health measures in place, it is tough to imagine how the company will carry even that 55% passenger load. On top of that, international flights will remain down by more than 80% year-over-year. Additionally, the company is worn down by its massive debt load, which will continue to grow if demand does not return to some normalcy. Let’s look at some of the factors which make AAL stock a bearish prospect at this point. American’s July schedule suggests that booking trends are improving, and the airline sector could be heading toward recovery. However, demand is well below 2019 levels at this time and is expected to stay that way for the foreseeable future. How “well below” is demand? One metric, TSA checkpoint data, shows that passenger traffic is down 85% year-over-year in recent weeks. These numbers could improve, but it’s tough to imagine how such deplorable levels of volume could help U.S. airlines make much money. This is especially true for a company like American, which has struggled with its net profit margins for most of the past decade. Furthermore, these gradual improvements in traffic are less impressive when they are matched with remarkably low fares. Airline companies have been offering ridiculous discounts to generate sales but are ruining margins in the process. American Airlines, in particular, seems to be leading the pack in offering massive discounts at this time. Through the end of April, the company was selling one-way tickets between Miami and Los Angeles for $16 and a round-trip for only $32! If its fares were similar to 2019 levels, the company’s cash flow forecast would’ve improved, but at this point, it is merely adding to the cash burn rate, which is expected to be around $6 billion in the second quarter alone. American Airlines’ debt and lease obligations were","Jun 14, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/06/dont-buy-into-the-recent-rally-in-aal-stock/

YOUNGER INVESTORS ON THE PROWL FOR HOT STOCKS.," Source: Pixabay by Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business — June 14, 2020 . tocks are still significantly higher than where they were in mid-March, even after Thursday’s blood curdling drop. Many experts have been scratching their heads wondering who is investing right now. The economy and corporate profits are in free fall because of the Covid-19 outbreak. So is the market being propped up by the Federal Reserve — which is now buying ETFs (exchange-traded fund ) – and big mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors hunting for bargains? Not exactly. It appears that many individual traders have been buying up stocks in recent months, including risky bankrupt firms as well as the FAANG tech giants (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). Younger millennials are actively hunting for bargains, one of the co-founders of the popular trading app Robinhood said at a recent investment conference. “We see a lot of buying activity of specifically industries that were impacted by the pandemic,” said Robinhood co-founder and co-CEO Vladimir Tenev said at the Piper Sandler Global Exchange & FinTech Conference last week. Get the top stories in your inbox every morning   Tenev added that the firm’s customers, whose median age is 31, are specifically scooping up shares of airlines, videoconferencing and streaming media companies as well as biotechs.   That’s an interesting array of stocks since these sectors represent a bet on both an eventual recovery from Covid-19 (airlines and pharma firms working on vaccines and treatments) as well as a continued work from and stay at home envrionment — i.e. firms like Zoom and Netflix. Airlines in particular seem to be popular stock picks for millennials, according to Frank Holmes, the CEO of US Global Investors, a firm that runs the JETS airline ETF. Holmes said he started to see a notable uptick in interest for the JETS ETF in March. After he and his staff looked more closely at trends on Robinhood, Holmes found that many younger investors were buying the ETF after a huge dip. “More millennials are working from home more and actively trading,” Holmes said, adding that airline stocks might be a popular “buy what you know” trade for younger people who like to travel and spend on experiences.

VOLATILITY.," Earlier this month, I’d discussed whether investors should be fearful in an uncertain environment. Bad economic data and high valuations have sparked fears of a market crash. I’d suggested that Fools should watch out for stocks with high valuations, especially tech stars like Shopify. The stock has shed nearly $300 from the all-time high it hit in late May. There is also the option to retreat to defensive stocks, a strategy that I’d covered earlier this week. Today, I want to explore a more balanced strategy. The stock market crash in the late winter and early spring throttled portfolios around the world. However, it also presented a mouth-watering buying opportunity. Bad economic data continues to poor in, and now investors are worried about a potential second wave of COVID-19. Instead of succumbing to the hysteria, this is a good time to steel yourself and hunt for bargains. Manulife Financial (TSX:MFC)(NYSE:MFC) is a top Canadian insurer and financial services company. Shares of Manulife have dropped 26% in 2020 as of close on June 11. However, the stock has climbed 10% over the past month. Manulife is a high-quality company that is well worth snagging at a discount for the long term. Like many financials, Manulife took a hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter. Net income fell to $1.3 billion — down $900 million from the prior year in Q1 2020. Manulife has continued to achieve robust growth on the back of its operations in Hong Kong and other Asian markets. Moreover, its LICAT capital ratio improved to 155%. The company is well positioned to weather global economic turbulence. Shares of Manulife last possessed a very favourable price-to-earnings ratio of eight and a price-to-book value of 0.7. Better yet, it still offers a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. This represents a strong 5.9% yield. The March market crash throttled airline stocks.

6,Generation Y Made a Wrong Choice on the Airline Stocks - AfricaOTR,Generation Y Made a Wrong Choice on the Airline Stocks. Reasons for the Airline Stocks Declining. Examples Of Airline Stock,"Image courtesy of Facebook/Generation Y Made a Wrong Choice on the Airline Stocks Since the coronavirus disease struck the world, the stock markets have not been doing well. Particularly, airline stocks have been declining significantly. However, a few weeks before 12 June 2020, the airline stocks were quite improving. David Portnoy had made some gains off the airline stocks criticizing Warren Buffett for selling his airline stock in fear of the coronavirus uncertainty. The United States President Donald Trump condemned Warren Buffett for selling Berkshire Hathaway’s airline stocks. Little did these investors know that they had made the wrong option for not following Warren Buffett’s lead in the airline stocks.    Before the airline stocks started going down, the stocks in the US, Hong Kong, China, and Europe witnessed gains in early June. However, the coronavirus created fear of investment and a lot of uncertainty in the market. Those who were wise like Warren Buffett saw the blow and had already sold off their stocks. In a case like American Airlines, they are using millions of dollars in cash in a single day to compensate costs such as salaries and leases for aircraft. Some aircraft companies are even planning in laying off pilots and workers because borders are not open and operations are not back to normal.    Even before these airline stocks started going down as they were, financial experts had already seen the vulnerability of these stocks early in March due to the financial crisis. Currently, the airlines are reducing expenses and increasing reserves to last throughout the crisis. This situation is greatly sinking the confidence of investors and resulting in the plunging of the airline stocks. Investors in the United States airline stocks are experiencing a dive by double numbers. United Airlines is 16.11% down, American Airlines is 15.51% down and Delta Airlines is 14.03% down.     He is the managing director of Citi. Mark says that due to this current pandemic the airline stocks are going down and this will pose a challenge in making profits to the airline industry in the future. In the long run, reducing profits bring danger to the airline’s companies in that a small reduction in passengers will challenge the profit margins. “It is not a crazy supposition to assume that the airline industry will struggle actually to get profitable again.” The views and","Jun 13, 2020",https://africaotr.com/generation-y-made-a-wrong-choice-on-the-airline-stocks/

Warren Buffett may have been right,"  (Business Insider) Jim Cramer is not too sympathetic to investors after Wall Street's bitter Thursday sell-off. ""When everyone thinks they're smarter than Warren Buffett, that's when you're in for a real bruising,"" the CNBC Mad Money host said on Thursday. Cramer said: ""The visceral nature of the losses — this is the kind of decline we haven't seen since the dark days of late March — has already wiped out a good chunk of the geniuses who crowded into the airlines, betting that they knew better than Buffett after he dumped the whole group."" Markets tanked on Thursday triggering Dow 30's worst sell-off since coronavirus lockdowns kicked in in March. A dire unemployment forecast by the Fed and investors weighing the risks of a second wave of coronavirus caused markets to tank.  The Dow Jones ended the day down more than 1860 points, a loss of nearly 7%. Shares in United Airlines, Delta Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines tanked on Thursday, losing between 8% and 16%. Famed investor Warren Buffett dumped his investments in the ""big four"" Airline stocks in April. But airline stocks began to creep up in May over optimism progress was being made towards creating a coronavirus vaccine. More than $5 billion was added to the market capitalizations of the big four US airlines, bringing into question whether Buffett had made a mistake.  A number of amateur traders have been betting against the likes of Buffett, with airline ETF JETS seeing assets surge nearly 3,000% in 3 months, boosted by millennial day traders.  President Donald Trump said Buffett made a mistake when he sold his airline stocks in April. Billionaire investor Ken Fisher suggested the 89-year-old's age might explain why he didn't go on a buying spree during the coronavirus sell-off. But Cramer thinks Buffett was right indeed.  Cramer said: ""I remember what it was like to be a novice investor. And right now there are millions of inexperienced shareholders who are going to be making the same mistakes I did when I got in this business."" Day traders are piling into Hertz, JCPenney, and other bankrupt companies despite the overwhelming odds that shareholders will be wiped out during bankruptcy proceedings. ""You go with companies that will be able to hit their numbers regardless of how badly this economy gets hit by all these new COVID-19 hot spots,"" Cramer said.","Jun 14, 2020",https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/article/jim-cramer-stands-buffett-and-bears

10,Hedge Funds Win One From Robinhood in Dizzying Week for Stocks,. . . . . . . . . . . . . BloombergQuint. Hedge Funds Win One From Robinhood,"(Bloomberg) -- A battle line is opening in the stock market. On one side are professional money managers focused on suddenly stodgy-seeming metrics like earnings growth. On the other, newbie day traders obsessed mainly with momentum. At least going by who got crushed the least this brutal week, score one for the old guard. The most turbulent stretch since March’s darkest days came with a shot of comeuppance for the stocks-always-go-up crowd, with companies and industries beloved by bottom-feeding retail buyers bearing the brunt of the worst drop in three months. While volatility soared and quant factors shook, shares that had jumped on little more than chat-room enthusiasm came hurtling back to earth. Underlining the Wall Street/Main Street division is a contrasting view on the economy in the era of coronavirus. While retail investors have piled into stocks like airlines, putting all their chips on an economic reopening, hedge funds have shunned the recovery trade in a cautious stance that -- lately -- had cost them. In a week when signs of a second wave of coronavirus inflections emerged and the S&P 500 sank almost 5%, the skepticism looked significantly less misplaced. “A lot of hedge funds are playing a longer game and have generally been suspicious of that very strong and quick rally in the market on the belief that something broke in the economy and it’s just not going to be this easy to recover,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management. For smaller traders, on the other hand, it’s been “a mania, to go for the stuff that looks the diciest and bet on a high-beta rally.” Stocks fell for the week, with the S&P 500 halting a rally whose returns by Monday amounted to more than 40% over 53 days, the best since 1933. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 5.6% while the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 2.3%. An index tracking hedge funds’ high-conviction bets lost 4.2%, faring better than those favored by individual investors for the first time in four weeks, according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The firm’s basket of retail favorites, including Delta Air Lines Inc. and MGM Resorts International, sank 6.7%, the most since March.

'The smart money is the Robinhood accounts and dumb,"  Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy discusses taking up day trading and upsetting the Wall Street establishment with his bullish trading attitude. The catalyst for Dave Portnoy's foray into the high-risk world of day-trading was the timeout that the COVID-19 pandemic imposed on professional sports. Without football, basketball, soccer or hockey -- the mainstays of the Barstool Sports blog he founded, Portnoy was at a loss. The stock market, volatile but still operating at full throttle, offered him a new challenge. “I'm trading my own money and lots of it,” Portnoy told FOX Business. “I'm having fun. As long as we're still kind of with nothing else to do, I'll keep day trading.” Portnoy has become the poster child of the day-trading craze, livestreaming his daily trading sessions on Twitter, giving followers a glimpse into both his successes and failures as he slings positions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Portnoy isn’t alone in diving headlong into the stock market to help fill his sports gambling void. The sports-betting industry was a $150 billion business in 2019 and gamblers have since March been limited to wagering on South Korean baseball and other obscure sports, causing many of them to turn their focus to the financial markets. “Sports gambling is a huge business in this country and a lot of sports gamblers and a lot of these millennial gamers are now playing the stock market, day trading,” Jim Bianco, president and macro strategist at Bianco Research, told FOX Business. The shift is evidenced in enrollment at Robinhood and other web-based trading platforms.  “The Robinhood numbers are just showing you parabolic increases in the amount of accounts opened, positions added and every other broker is telling us the same thing,” he said. Nearly 800,000 people opened new accounts at the three biggest online brokers in March and April amid the heart of the COVID-19 lockdowns, according to the Financial Times. That wave of new accounts has infused life into an industry that had been left for dead.

Such a cost-cutting effort may also be undertaken by management due to a recession or other economic or market dislocation or crisis, such as one that causes production overcapacity or redundancy. Hiring freezes may be short term or long term and are often used to otherwise avoid laying off employees. Hiring freezes may be accomplished by not filling open positions caused by worker terminations or natural attrition. In addition, no new positions may be created.

This requires existing employees to fulfill the job responsibilities of vacant positions. If the situation gets too extreme, the overall performance may suffer, along with employee job satisfaction. This can also lead to employees leaving the firm if they feel the workload is too intense and they are not being compensated fairly. A hiring freeze may also compel managers to retain low-performing employees rather than dealing with their underperformance, either through remedial action or termination.
