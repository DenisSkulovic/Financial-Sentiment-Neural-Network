0,Here's Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Again Today | The Motley Fool,Here's Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Again Today. Everyone is waiting for word out of Washington.. What happened. So what.,"   Another day, another double-digit drop at the opening for airline stocks. The industry and its investors are fixated on a government assistance package, and while White House officials continue to insist it is a top priority, every day nothing gets done adds to the uncertainty. Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) opened down more than 20%, while a basket of airlines including American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) all opened down more than 10%. Most have recovered at least some after that initial fall but expect the volatility to remain as we await more news about a potential bailout. The airline industry's woes are well documented, with the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic all but wiping out global travel demand and causing bookings to drop to record lows. The industry has scrambled to cut costs by freezing hiring and cutting schedules, but there is no amount of cost cutting that can offset revenue falling off a cliff. Delta Air Lines, for example, said it expects March revenue to decline by about $2 billion year over year, with April expected to be worse. Delta is grounding upwards of 600 planes and taking other steps to control costs, but in a memo to employees, CEO Ed Bastian said he doesn't know if that will be enough. ""In this unpredictable environment we can't take any options off the table,"" he said. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. White House officials have said airlines are a top priority, with the industry floating a $50 billion package of grants, deferred taxes, and loan guarantees to get them through the crisis. But there is substantial pushback to that plan, and the outlook for aid, and what form that aid might take, is uncertain. Meanwhile, the global situation for airlines continues to grow more dire. The International Air Transport Association on Thursday said upwards of $200 billion in aid will be required worldwide to rescue the industry. There is a confidence game of sorts going on with the industry right now. Most of the airlines have a cash runway of a couple of months and plenty of unencumbered assets to use as collateral for new financing. But they need lenders, creditors, and other counterparties to remain confident the airlines will not eventually go bankrupt in order to access additional","Mar 19, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/19/heres-why-airline-stocks-are-falling-again-today.aspx
1,AAL Stock: Only One Thing Matters for American Airlines Right Now | InvestorPlace,Only One Thing Matters for American Airlines Stock Right Now. Is the government riding to the rescue ... and on," Airline stocks like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) have been wiped out in this selloff. Since Feb. 12, AAL stock has lost 62% of its value.  American is not alone. Among the four major U.S. airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is the “winner” over the stretch, with a 40% decline. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has matched AAL’s drop. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) has lost three-fourths of its value. After those declines, some investors might believe the worst is priced in for AAL stock, and the sector. They should rethink that opinion. It absolutely can get worse. In fact, for American, another bankruptcy remains a potential outcome — in which case, the downside is another 100%. On its own, it will at least take American many months, and likely several years, to convince the market its financial position is sound. In the meantime, AAL stock is going to trade on hopes that a savior is on the way. At a conference last week, American tried to calm investor nerves about its financial position. The company disclosed that it has $7.3 billion in liquidity (cash on hand, plus short-term borrowing capacity). As American noted, that’s more than any other airline in the world. But American also has much more debt than any of its fellow majors. Short- and long-term debt totaled over $24 billion at the end of 2019. The figure for Southwest is less than $3 billion. As Barron’s noted last weekend, American’s debt load is the highest among U.S. carriers relative to underlying profits, too. This isn’t a case where American has more debt simply because it’s bigger. That $7.3 billion might — emphasis on might — be enough to get American through what will be an enormously difficult 2020. American is offering voluntary leave to employees to cut costs. Fuel expenses will be dramatically lower for what flights still operate. American is going to lose money this year, but it might not lose $7 billion — or, more importantly, burn that much in cash. The company is reportedly looking to raise more cash as well. Bloomberg reported this week that American is looking for a one-year credit facility in the “billions of dollars.” It would appear likely that the facility would be backed by assets, including what the company has said are over $10 billion worth of aircraft. Still, the massive debt load means that just making it through 2020 isn’t","Mar 20, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/03/only-one-thing-matters-for-american-airlines-aal-stock-right-now/
2,"Once the Friendly Skies Open Up, LUV Stock Could Soar | InvestorPlace","If You Must Buy One Airline Stock, LUV Stock May Be the One. It’s in a solid position for a"," Has Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) hit a bottom? On two occasions in the week leading up to Mar. 17, LUV stock has bounced off a low around $36 per share. The stock has taken a beating in 2020 and is down nearly 30%. However, Southwest is not an outlier. The entire industry is suffering as consumers race to cancel previously booked flights in light of the coronavirus.  You’d have to be crazy to buy an airline stock right now, right? That may be true, but Warren Buffett once said, “Be greedy when others are fearful.” If you follow that logic, now may be the time to look at what’s next for airline stocks in general, and I would argue for LUV stock in particular. In response to the crisis, Southwest announced they would be cutting flights by 20% between April and June. “As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic grows, and based on current booking and cancellation trends, we expect revenue trends for the remainder of March and second quarter 2020 to deteriorate further,” the company said in a regulatory filing Monday. In addition, the company has also taken out a $1 billion loan from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). The company is also suspending share repurchases. With the loan, the company has just over $6 billion in unrestricted cash to help it weather the crisis. The company is also looking at other measures. On the substantive front, the company is offering voluntary leave to some employees. And then there are symbolic measures such as the company’s decision to restrict passengers to water only on longer flights. And then there is the company’s CEO Gary Kelly’s decision to take a 10% pay cut in solidarity with rank-and-file employees. It’s easy to get cynical about decisions like that, but I’ll give Kelly credit for the gesture. During the financial crisis, the words “too big to fail” become part of our national discussion. Right now, “through no fault of their own” is the rationale coming out of Washington. A number of industries, including airline companies, are about to have a bucket full of money dropped on them to help them survive the economic contraction, which may very well lead to a recession fueled by the coronavirus. On Mar. 16, President Donald Trump said his administration is interested in providing financial assistance to the airlines. “We’re going to back the airlines 100%,” said Trump.","Mar 19, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/03/luv-stock-in-position-for-rebounding/

5,"Airlines Should Shut Down, Analyst Says. Here’s Why. | Barron's","Airlines Should Shut Down Now, One Analyst Says. Why the Industry Could Benefit From Such a Radical Solution.. Newsletter Sign-up.","  Airlines should shut down, park their aircraft, furlough all workers, and preserve cash for the day when air travel resumes. It sounds draconian. But the industry now needs such radical measures, according to Helane Becker, a veteran airline analyst with Cowen & Co. “The best thing for the industry would be to shut down entirely, furlough everyone nonessential, and wait for this to pass,” Becker said in an interview with Barron’s. “If demand comes back in the summer, they can start to ramp up, but it won’t come back to the way it was. The airlines aren’t going to need as many people anyway.” Shutting down all passenger flights would conserve cash that airlines need for debt service, Becker says. Other analysts are starting to model industry revenues going to zero as airlines continue to slash schedules and travelers cancel booked flights. “Zero revenue not so far from reality,” wrote Vertical Research Partners analyst Darryl Genovesi in a note published Thursday. “This is a dramatization, but isn’t far from the new reality as each capacity reduction far exceeds the one that preceded it.” Assuming no passenger revenues for the rest of the year, he writes, airlines would have cash outflows of $40 billion. Some of that would be offset through reductions in capital expenditures, along with other cuts in fixed and operating costs. But U.S. airline stocks have lost $73 billion in market value since late February, he notes, implying that investors expect a near shutdown in travel to last for many months. Exclusive data, tables and charts from Barron's Market Lab. Airlines appear to be inching toward shutdowns anyway. American Airlines Group (ticker: AAL) plans to cancel 30% of flights in May and 23% in the second quarter, Becker says. Delta Air Lines (DAL) has canceled 65% of flights in May and 50% for the second quarter. United Airlines Holdings’ (UAL) schedule is down 50%. Southwest Airlines (LUV) is shrinking capacity by 20% from mid-April through early June. Its planes were flying 67% full in mid-March and are trending down to 50%, according to the CAPA Centre for Aviation, an airline industry research group. JetBlue Airways (JBLU) said in a filing this week that a normal March day would produce $22 million in revenue, Becker wrote in a note published Thursday. “Yesterday they booked less than $4 million and processed $20 million in refunds,” she notes.

United agrees $500 million term,"Welcome to flightglobal.com. This site uses cookies. Read our policy. By Jon Hemmerdinger20 March 2020 President Donald Trump supports imposing stock buyback restrictions on companies that receive financial aid as part of the federal government’s coronavirus recovery package. Airlines and Boeing, which have been criticised for spending billions of dollars repurchasing their own stock during recent boom years, are among US businesses seeking financial help. “I would demand that there would be no stock buybacks,” Trump says during a press conference on 20 March. “I don’t want them taking hundreds of millions of dollars and buying back their own stock.” Trump’s comments come the day after the US Senate released an economic package that would provide US airlines up to $58 billion in collateralised government loans and loan guarantees. The bill would also provide $150 billion in loans to “distressed” industries – a category Senate officials say could include Boeing and other aerospace manufacturing companies. The Senate bill does not prohibit stock buybacks, though the ultimate aid package could change as it works through both chambers of the US Congress. “I want that money to be used for workers,” Trump says. “And also for the company… To keep the company going. I don’t like buybacks.” Trump notes that, following the 2017 tax law overhaul, some US companies invested tax savings back into their own stocks. “That’s not building a hangar. That’s not buying aircraft… That’s not the kind of things I want them to do,” he says. “We didn’t think we would have had to restrict it, because we thought they would have known better. But they didn’t know better.” Neither airline trade group Airlines for America (A4A) or Boeing responded to requests to comment about Trump’s statements.  Source: Max Kingsley-Jones/FlightGlobal An American Airlines Boeing 787. The US airline industry had requested $58 billion in aid. But it seeks half in the form of grants – which would not be repaid – and the other half in unsecured loans. Boeing is leading a request for a minimum of $60 billion for the whole US aerospace manufacturing industry. Those requests came under fire in the media this week, with critics faulting the companies for requesting money after spending billions on buybacks. Share buybacks give companies a place to invest cash they might not immediately need, and buybacks can push up share prices to the benefit of shareholders.

This year’s Rose Bowl, one of the two CFP semifinal matchups,","  BUSINESSAIRLINES By Kyle Arnold 8:43 AM on Mar 19, 2020 CDT American Airlines is taking out a $1 billion line of credit from Citibank as airlines look for cash to stay afloat in the event of more financial pain in the travel industry. American announced the deal Thursday, giving it $8.4 billion in “available liquidity,"" including $4.2 billion in unrestricted cash, to prepare for the coming months, the company said.   Airlines including United and Southwest have been looking to banks for loans as the coronavirus pandemic turns the aviation industry upside-down. Airline stocks plummeted in trading Wednesday, including a 25% decrease for American shares, after news broke that Congressional leaders were only considering $50 billion in loans and not more than $25 billion in government grants many were hoping for. Fort Worth-based American is among the airlines that have already taken unprecedented measures to cut spending. It will cut back on flights in future months, freeze hiring and is offering unpaid leave to most of its union workers. It’s also suspended share repurchases. Researchers have proven that being helpful to others releases dopamine — the “feel-good” chemical — in our brains and lights up the same... American is also parking most of its wide-body fleet as it has significantly cut back on international flying and plans to retire its Boeing 757 and 767 jets. Including the regional airlines it owns, American has about 130,000 employees, including more than 33,000 in North Texas. “COVID-19 is a bigger threat to airlines and aerospace than all prior crises,” said a report Thursday from analysts at Cowen. Aviation industry groups say airlines may need help from the government to get through the emerging crisis. “The scale of the current industry crisis is much worse and far more widespread than 9/11, SARS or the 2008 Global Financial Crisis,” IATA director general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement Thursday. “Airlines are fighting for survival.” American’s $1 billion loan is due in one year.

Click here for March 20, 2020 stock market news. From CNN Business' Anneken Tappe  US stocks closed higher on Thursday, eking out steady gains in the afternoon following a morning of volatile trading. The Dow swung more than 1,200 points from its low to its high point. It finished up nearly 1%, or 188 points. It was the first time since March 6 that the index closed within 1,000 points from where it opened. The S&P 500 closed up 0.5%, also by far its most modest finish since the start of the month. The Nasdaq Composite, which was the best performer of the day, ended up 2.3%. From CNN Business' Clare Duffy In a matter of days, mass numbers of workers, students and businesses have increased their use of the internet to work, communicate and stay entertained as coronavirus spreads. Netflix said Thursday it will reduce streaming quality in Europe to keep the internet from collapsing under the strain of unprecedented usage. But Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said he's not concerned about the US network's ability to handle the traffic. “So far (we’re seeing) no congestion in the network, we can handle that, we have built a very robust network,"" Vestberg told CNN's Richard Quest Thursday. The company has noted a shift in the types of applications relying on the network: gaming is up 75% from the prior week, web traffic is up 20%, VPN usage is up 30% and streaming is up 10%. In less than one week, 100,000 of Verizon's 135,000 global employees have shifted to remote working arrangements, but Vestberg said the company remains focused on network up-keep. “We still have field engineers in the market keeping the network up ... We need to keep these networks up because they are so important in this critical moment and this crisis right now,” he said. From CNN Business' Matt Egan  This is how insane the oil market is right now: US oil prices spiked by 24% on Thursday, marking a record one-day percentage gain. Yet even that massive rally wasn't enough to recover the $6.58-per-barrel that crude lost only the day before. Still, the spike might raise hopes that the energy market could be finding a bottom after an historic collapse. Crude settled at an 18-year low on Wednesday in response to shrinking demand and surging supply.","Mar 20, 2020",https://edition.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-news-today-031920/index.html
