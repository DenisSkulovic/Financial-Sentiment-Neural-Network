0,The Top Airline Stocks to Buy in 2020,. . Airline Stocks - Top Airline Stocks to Buy Now. Top Airline Companies in the World. Airline Industry. Top,"  More people than ever before travel by plane. This has caused massive growth in the airline industry—and Wall Street has taken note. For those who are interested in learning more about the best airline stocks, it’s important to learn about the major carriers. From Linhas Aereas to Spirit airlines, many carriers from around the globe are respectable players in the industry. However, the world's top international airlines have each developed a unique strategy that has propelled them to become leaders within the industry. Before investing in airline stocks, it helps to understand some of the key aspects of this high-flying industry. According to the International Air Transport Association, the number of air travelers has massively increased in recent years. In 2012, there were about 3 billion air travelers, but in 2019 there is expected to be about 4.5 billion. The global airline industry has a total revenue of over $800 billion. Though this is a large and quickly growing industry, airlines often struggle to differentiate themselves. There is little to no difference between the fleets of planes each airline flies. All airlines use either Boeing or Airbus jets. Airlines need a variety of different types of planes to make different types of journeys. Having more or bigger planes isn’t necessarily beneficial unless they’re used on the right routes at the right times. A plane with better fuel economy can save money since fuel costs are minimized, while a plane with well-known issues, such as Boeing’s 737 Max, can cost companies a lot of money. The biggest expense for airlines is gas, which also makes it harder for airlines to differentiate themselves since fuel costs affect all airlines similarly. Consumers want to get where they’re going as quickly and cheaply as possible and there is not much that airlines can do to change either of these two things. For example, an airline can include a free checked bag in the price of the ticket, but commercial airplanes travel at the same speeds. In general, most major airline companies have positioned themselves into two major groups: full-service and budget. Full-service airlines aim to meet the needs of many different types of travelers, both business and leisure, by offering many different flight options to destinations all over the world. Budget airlines focus almost exclusively on price and try to appeal to cost-conscious consumers. These top companies showcase the many different strategies","Dec 23, 2019",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/airline-stocks/

2,20 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2020 | The Motley Fool,20 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2020. These dividend stocks should make 2020 a happy new year for income,"   A new year is on the way. With it comes plenty of excitement... and perhaps some nervousness for investors. No one knows what the stock market will do in 2020. After the longest bull run ever and the inherent uncertainty in a presidential election year, investors can't be blamed for being at least a little apprehensive -- especially investors who rely on income generated by the stocks they own. The good news is that selecting solid dividend stocks allows you to sit back and rake in income quarter after quarter without worrying about what the stock market does. But which stocks are smart picks? Here are 20 high-yield dividend stocks you can buy in 2020, listed in alphabetical order. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) offers a dividend that yields nearly 5.3%. The big drugmaker recently increased its dividend by 10.3% and has grown the dividend by a whopping 195% since being spun off from Abbott Labs in 2013. Although AbbVie faces headwinds for its top-selling drug Humira, the rest of its lineup plus its pending acquisition of Allergan should put the company in great shape to keep the dividends flowing. Telecommunications giant AT&T's (NYSE:T) dividend currently yields 5.4%. The company is a Dividend Aristocrat and boasts 36 consecutive years of dividend increases. AT&T's entertainment business is still under heavy pressure, but its wireless business should remain strong.  Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP) pays a dividend with a yield just shy of 4%. The company's infrastructure assets, including cell towers, natural gas pipelines, ports, and toll roads, provide a steady revenue stream. Brookfield Infrastructure expects to grow organically by between 6% and 9% in 2020 as it adds new infrastructure assets to its portfolio. Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is Brookfield Infrastructure's sibling, with both companies controlled by general partner Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield Renewable, as its name indicates, focuses primarily on renewable energy assets including hydroelectric, wind, and solar power facilities. Its dividend currently yields close to 4.5%. 2019 hasn't been a great year for the energy sector. But Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has performed better than most energy stocks. The company's strong balance sheet and relatively low cash-flow break even point of $51 per barrel of oil puts the company in a position to weather a tough oil market and to perform really well in a good market.

3,Here are some guesses at what could be the best stock of the 2020s,Netflix shares won the decade. Here are some guesses at what could be the top stock of the 2020s. Energy:,"As 2010 began, Netflix was a nascent challenger to the sprawling media industry, worth less than $8 a share. Fast forward 10 years — and a stock gain of more than 4,200% — and Netflix is now a technology giant mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Apple and Facebook, with dozens of Wall Street analysts recommending Netflix shares to investors. But a new decade has come. Are there any stocks with the potential for those kinds of gains in the next 10 years? Finding stocks with this kind of potential is a difficult and risky task. Dozens of public companies could be crowned the high-growth disruptor of the next decade. In order to find some potential winners, CNBC analyzed megatrends just emerging similar to streaming a decade ago, and found companies whose fortunes are tied to those big changes. The following seven companies appear ripe to surpass investor expectations, each in a different category: energy innovation, big data explosion, autonomy, travel, aging, agriculture and entertainment.  However, as UBS noted earlier this year, it is “important to differentiate between trends and fads,” and that’s what can make this so difficult. The firm advised investors to ground their strategies in three reliable long-term trends: population growth (“by 2050, the global population is expected to reach 10 billion, up from 7.5 billion today”), aging (“the population is getting older and living longer”) and urbanization (“by 2050, it is expected that 68% of the world’s population will reside in cities”). “From an investment perspective, we are focused on the problem-solving companies that are meeting the needs of a changing world,” UBS said. With that warning in mind, here are the stocks with the ambition of revolutionizing whole industries. The shift to clean energy is no longer about if, it’s when. “We expect the drive towards cleaner energy to continue, as cleaner power generation is
increasingly competitive versus traditional fossil-fuel-based technologies,” Credit Suisse said in a January note. The firm recently called out NextEra Energy, with its “world-leading large-scale renewable development business,” as a top pick in the energy sector. “Investors are more focused than ever on global warming’s impact on the economy, society, unemployment and migration,” Bank of America said in November, a change to which clean energy companies stand to benefit. Coal, oil and gas may not be going away tomorrow, but Credit Suisse thinks the change in energy’s economics","Dec 23, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/here-are-some-guesses-at-what-could-be-the-best-stock-of-the-2020s.html

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Aegon N.V. (AMS:AGN), which is in the insurance business, and is based in Netherlands, saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the ENXTAM over the last few months. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Aegon’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Aegon According to my relative valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 20.06x is currently well-above the industry average of 12.61x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Aegon’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Aegon. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? AGN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time","Dec 23, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aegon-n-v-ams-agn-035837222.html

See also[edit]. References[edit]. External links[edit].," Bradley Air Services Limited, operating as First Air, was an airline headquartered in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.[6] It operated services to 34 communities in Nunavut, Nunavik, and the Northwest Territories.[5] First Air has assisted in various humanitarian missions such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, airlifting relief supplies and equipment.[8] Its main base, which included a large hangar, cargo and maintenance facility, was located at Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, with hubs at Iqaluit Airport, and Yellowknife Airport.[9] On November 1, 2019, the airline consolidated operations with Canadian North.[10] The airline was founded by Canadian aviation pioneer Russel (Russ) Bradley and started operations as Bradley Air Services in 1946 and is still registered under that name. First Air started scheduled operations in 1973, between Ottawa and North Bay. This service was operated with an eight-seat passenger plane. The airline opened southern gateways at Edmonton, Winnipeg, Montreal and Ottawa. Through Kuujjuaq in Nunavik and Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories (NWT), the airline provides services to 26 Inuit communities in Nunavut, Nunavik and the NWT.[5] Service to Sanikiluaq, Nunavut is provided in partnership with Air Inuit. In 1995, First Air acquired Ptarmigan Airways, and in 1997 Northwest Territorial Airways (also known as NWT Air), both merged into First Air.[11] Ptarmigan Airways operated smaller turboprop aircraft types such as the Beechcraft King Air (BE-200 model), de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Turbine Beaver, DHC-6 Twin Otter and Grumman Gulfstream I propjets in addition to Cessna Citation business jet aircraft. Northwest Territorial operated Boeing 727-100 and Boeing 737-200 jetliners, Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets, Lockheed L-100 Hercules cargo turboprops and Douglas DC-3s. First Air is wholly owned by the Inuit people of Quebec through the Makivik Corporation, which purchased the company in 1990.[12][13] On 21 August 2008, First Air fired president Bob Davis and replaced him with Scott Bateman. Davis had been president since December 1997 and had several disagreements with First Air over a period of time.[14] On 5 June 2009, First Air received a wide-body aircraft, a Boeing 767-223 SF (Super Freighter), which was under a three-year dry lease from (CAM) Cargo Aircraft Management, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group (ATSG).[15] The 767 has since left the fleet.

Here’s the sobering answer: An investor would have done just as well avoiding all the risk and volatility of equities and buying an index of plain vanilla, guaranteed government bonds. A mix of Canadian federal, municipal and provincial government debt returned 94 per cent in the decade following the great financial crisis, as central banks around the world primed the economic pump with lower interest rates. That led to outsized gains for government debt, whose prices rise as rates fall. The return for Canada’s main equity gauge was remarkably similar, gaining 95 per cent since the end of 2009. That’s less than half the 255 per cent return for the S&P 500 index in the U.S., as Canadian stocks were weighed down by mining and energy companies like EnCana Corp. That doesn’t mean there weren’t some off-the-charts stock winners: Boyd Group Income Fund, the auto-repair shop owner from Winnipeg, Manitoba, returned a whopping 4,300 per cent in the decade, including dividends. Not far behind was perennial gainer Constellation Software Inc., up 4,200. Air Canada was third at about 3,700 per cent. Here are some other highlights from the decade, which is set to end with equities at a record high and corporate bonds on pace for their best annual performance in a decade.

While it lived to see another day, what followed was a year of near-zero profit growth. Unrelated facts? Unlikely. One of the best explanations for the $5 trillion equity meltdown that culminated at Christmas is that it represented investors figuring out a poor year for corporate earnings was in the cards, and adjusting prices accordingly. It’s an old adage. Markets see the future first. What about now, when investors are enjoying the opposite of last year’s rout? The S&P 500 has jumped 10% since October began, gaining in 10 of the last 11 weeks. If you believe share prices are prescient, it may bode well for 2020’s economic tidings. “The market’s always been a forward-pricing mechanism,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. “What’s the market getting right or wrong? The market is trying now, in the last three months, to price in what might go right in 2020.” What could go right is a rebound in growth, a pick-up in S&P 500 profits. At the close of a year in which the yield curve inverted, recession bells rang and a trade war weighed on executive confidence, the index is notching one of its best rallies in decades. Meanwhile, earnings growth has been virtually non-existent, but the future is looking brighter. An October study by the research firm CXO Advisory Group LLC looked at the relationship between earnings and market moves and found that stocks usually anticipate corporate results, not the other way around. The “strongest indication” observed in the study was that stock returns lead earnings by one quarter. The connection may have been at work last year, when the worst fourth quarter of the bull market preceded a raft of earnings downgrades. Expectations for 10% profit growth were dashed, and projections tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence fell by the most since 2016, when S&P 500 firms were in the midst of an earnings recession. A similar prescience was on display in 2017, too. The S&P 500 jumped","Dec 22, 2019",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/psychic-stocks-that-foresaw-a-profit-crash-are-much-happier-now-1.1365987
13,Will Going After Citi Card Churners Backfire on American Airlines? | Nasdaq,Will Going After Citi Card Churners Backfire on American Airlines?. Flying the unfriendly skies. TRENDING TOPICS. TRENDING ARTICLES. IN THIS,"There's a rumbling in the community of credit card churners, folks who apply for new cards to nab attractive sign-up bonuses before moving on to the next piece of plastic. American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) has been locking down and in some cases terminating AAdvantage accounts this month of folks who acquired too many loyalty miles through Citigroup (NYSE: C) mailers, in some cases stranding travelers by canceling their awards-based flights.  This is a story that has more turns than you'd probably think in trying to sort out the good guys from the bad. It's quite possible there are no clean hands in this mess as the airline giant tries to sift out the unprofitable accounts churning away in the gray areas of sign-up-bonus eligibility. The ""fasten your seat belts"" light is on, so buckle up as we size up the turbulence.  Image source: American Airlines. Issuing credit cards is a big business, and the competition is fierce to stand out. The end result of the one-upmanship is good news for consumers, with great offers to top lists of the best credit cards for 2020. It's in this operating climate that Citigroup has been aggressively promoting its family of American Airlines-branded cards that reward purchases with AAdvantage miles over points or cash-back opportunities. Approved cardholders for Citi can earn as many as 75,000 AAdvantage miles after spending as much as $5,000 in the first few months of ownership, a hefty bounty that can cover the cost of a few low-priced trips. These cards typically include the boilerplate language that these bonuses can be earned only by folks who haven't received the sign-up bonus miles in the past 24 months, limiting the payouts to every two years. However, Citigroup has also been aggressively putting out mailers and online offers for years, and until recently those promotional pitches didn't include the 24-month language. Sniffing out a loophole, churners were limited solely by Citi's velocity cap that OKs just two new approvals roughly every two months. Folks began to create bogus accounts to generate more of these promotional mailings without the 24-month sign-up-bonus limitation, and since there was often no language making the mailers non-transferable, there quickly emerged a marketplace for churners to buy or trade for these potentially lucrative deals.  It's easy to point the finger at the churners who were clearly sidestepping the intention of the miles-earning program.

Ashish Chhawchharia, the appointed resolution professional of Jet Airways, had recently informed the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on December 17 that two entities had shown early interest to invest in in the grounded airline. Turbo Aviation Private Ltd has emerged as one of those entities. Earlier this week, Turbo Aviation Pvt. Ltd had firmed up an investment of about 100 million pounds from a UK based Group. Turbo Aviation had announced its plans to launch a new low-cost airline ‘TruStar’ by mid 2020. One of the persons close to the development said ""The Indian company reached out to the RP about six days ago. The RP is yet to receive any formal request from it."" Turbo is founded by V. Umesh, who was associated with no frills airliner TruJet initially. When BusinesLine reached out to Umesh, he refused to comment on the same. Another person associated with Turbo said that the company is ""Evaluating the possibilities for the same. However, nothing is formulated yet."" The third person said that it was important to verify all the KYC documents, and other proof. ""Yes, there has been an early interest, however, we have burnt our fingers with several entities who were unable to present proof of business and deposit money. Hence, it's better not to take this early interest at face value."" The NCLT on December 20 extended the CIRP process for the by another 90 days after the 180 day extension was over. So far, only Synergy, which had submitted their KYC, had expressed formal interest in the grounded Jet Airways. Meanwhile, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) on Saturday approved the extension for a fresh round of Expression of Interest (EoI). According to a notice on the Jet Airways website, potential bidders can express their interest to acquire a stake in the defunct airline by January 6. Thereafter, the bidders are supposed to submit a resolution plan by February 8.            Follow us on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Linkedin.

16,"Attention GoAir flyers! Multiple flights cancelled, airline offers relief to passengers - The Financial Express","Attention GoAir flyers! Multiple flights cancelled, airline offers relief to passengers. GoAir, however, has released a statement saying the disruption","Attention GoAir flyers, the airline has cancelled 18 flights! Flyers, who have booked GoAir flight tickets, must take note that the no-frills airline has cancelled 18 domestic flights on Monday i.e December 23 citing non-availability of adequate cockpit crew and aircraft. Cancelled flights were originally scheduled from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Goa, Jammu, Srinagar, Patna and Indore. The airline was facing dual issues pertaining to crew and aircraft problem, as per a PTI report. GoAir, however, has released a statement saying the disruption in flight operations was due to protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and issues related to the duty norms of the operating crew. However, the airline has not specified the number of cancelled flights on Monday. The airline has witnessed issues pertaining to engine glitches, particularly in its A320 Neo aircraft. This has bearing on the availability of some of such planes for flight operations, the PTI report said. Several factors like low visibility, inclement weather, anti-CAA protests in certain parts of India have resulted in disruptions of flight operations. Flight duty time limitations (FDTL) of the crew aggravated the situation, a GoAir spokesperson was quoted as saying by PTI. While flyers complained that sudden cancellations of their flights have caused inconvenience, the airline stated that all possible steps have been taken to minimise the inconvenience caused to the passengers, PTI reported. Go Air has stated that it is offering free cancellation and re-booking options all the affected flyers to minimise the inconvenience, the GoAir spokesperson told PTI. Earlier in December, GoAir stated that topped the On-time-performance chart in November 2019. GoAir held to the number one spot for 15th month in a row for On-time-performance measured by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the airline said in a statement. GoAir flew 14.22 lakh passengers in November 2019 and reported one of the highest load factors.
