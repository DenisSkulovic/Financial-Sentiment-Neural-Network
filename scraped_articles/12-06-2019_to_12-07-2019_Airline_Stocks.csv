0,Picking Stocks in a Recession Is Gambling | by Ben Le Fort | Making of a Millionaire | Medium,You have 2 free member-only stories left this month. Sign up for Medium and get an extra one. Top highlight.,"In the past three months, I’ve been seeing many different articles that advocate investing in individual stocks. The narrative that gets spun in these stories is that certain companies are either well-positioned to thrive in the current state of the economy or have seen their stock price fall so low that they now offer compelling value to investors. In this article, I am going to explain the massive flaw in this kind of thinking and why picking individual stocks in a recession amounts to gambling with your money. I’ll also review a more rational way to invest. Every day I see a new article giving advice on stocks to buy during the recession. These stock picks come in two varieties. Both of these narratives try and sell the reader on the idea that they can achieve fantastic investment returns. Admittedly, these narratives seem compelling to the average person who may not know much about investing in the stock market. If you examine these narratives with basic knowledge of how the stock market works, you realize these are nothing more than stories. Let’s start with the idea of picking stocks that will thrive while so many people are working from home. I’ll use Zoom as a stand-in for all of these types of companies, as it is the stock cited most often in these types of articles. At the time I write this, Zoom’s stock price has increased by 150% from where it was on December 6th, 2019. 150% in 5 months. That sounds incredible, and it is, to an investor who bought Zoom stock on December 6th. For an investor who is thinking about purchasing Zoom stock today, that 150% return means absolutely nothing. You might argue that companies like Zoom will see a massive increase in future revenue, so we should expect to see an enormous rise in its stock price. Anyone making that argument does not understand how the stock market works. By the time you read an article telling you about how much money Zoom is going to make, you are too late to capitalize as an investor. The fact that Zoom is going to make a lot more money is already reflected in the stock price. If you wanted to make a killing with Zoom stock, you should have bought it in December. If you buy Zoom stock today, you are making a bet that Zoom’s","Dec 6, 2019",https://medium.com/makingofamillionaire/picking-stocks-in-a-recession-is-gambling-1f89014fe6e2
1,,. . . . . . . . . . . . . BloombergQuint. Two Key Things That Keep IndiGo,"WATCH | Indigo vs SpiceJet SpiceJet Ltd. has added the most capacity since the grounding of Jet Airways India Ltd. Yet, its larger peer InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. remains better placed operationally in a market grappling with falling yields, volatile costs and engine glitches. Average fare per passenger per kilometre, or yields, have been falling in India because of higher capacity addition, weak demand and competition in India. Crude prices and the dollar remained fairly volatile. For an airline, cost volatility is high, as 60-70 percent of its expenses are dollar-denominated and fuel accounts for more than a third of its costs. Both SpiceJet and IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation, saw costs also rise due to grounding of Boeing 737 Max aircraft and replacement of engines of Airbus A320neos, respectively. IndiGo, India’s largest carrier, scores higher on two key parameters even as SpiceJet is looking to catch up. IndiGo’s cost per unit is lower than that of SpiceJet. On an average, in the last five quarters, IndiGo’s cost per available seat kilometre remained lower by 17 percent, according to data disclosed by the companies. That helped the airline to report profits or pare losses even as yields declined. These costs could come down as the share of fuel-efficient A320neos and A321 increases in its fleet. To be sure, the aircraft are facing engine issues and IndiGo has said that Airbus has delayed deliveries. Also Read: Airbus Wins 300-Jet Order From Asian Discount Carrier IndiGo IndiGo has a stronger balance sheet with higher free cash on books worth Rs 8,700 crore and a better liquidity ratio—cash-to-sales—of 26 percent. Usually, keeping a fifth of the sales as cash is considered safe for airlines globally. A stronger balance sheet is even more important for airlines as the operating environment is volatile because of changing costs. Also Read: Will SpiceJet’s Expansion Falter On A Thin Cash Buffer? IndiGo, with three times the size of SpiceJet, doubled its share in the domestic market in the last five years. Its international share doubled in just a year, and the airline plans to add more capacity on global routes. International operations act as a hedge against foreign currency movements and help lower costs. That’s because fuel used for international flights does not attract any taxes and is cheaper outside India. IndiGo still aims to grow its overall capacity at more than 20 percent. But it lowered the forecast","Dec 6, 2019",https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/indigo-vs-spicejet-whos-better-placed

4,Watch These 2 Transport Stocks With Hong Kong Set to Rally - RealMoney,Watch These 2 Transport Stocks With Hong Kong Set to Rally. Is the Hong Kong market poised to jump 40%?,"It's been a torrid time for transportation stocks in Hong Kong. There are rumblings, though, that private banks are advising clients to take heavy positions in the city's stocks, betting they will rally. Perhaps no company has suffered more directly than the MTR Corp. (MTCPY) . Besides operating the subway, or Mass Transit Railway, it is also a major property developer, selling off the apartments above the stations that it builds, then operating the shopping malls below. Protesters first targeted the system purely as a method of civil disobedience, keeping train doors open to cause mayhem at rush hour. But stations became direct targets after demonstrators blamed the company for delaying trains so that riot police could enter them and make arrests. The system also started closing early in what critics saw as a government-endorsed curfew, or a way of preventing protesters from returning home. To be honest, stations were often forced to close, given the way turnstiles and ticket booths were torched, smashed or spray painted. Throwing debris onto the lines is another popular form of disruption. The company has just put a dollar figure on the vandalization and decreased ridership it has experienced over the course of six months of protests. MTR says it will take a HK$1.6 billion (US$204 million) hit to earnings, thanks to damage, the drop in trips, and rent concessions to companies with stores in and around stations. Its shares, which are listed but still 75% owned by the financial secretary's office, have plummeted 20.7% since mid-July. The stock has yet to show much sign of life. Amazingly, though, the company still expects to be in the black this year thanks to its real estate rental income and apartment sales, in the most expensive residential market in the world. Last year, it saw profits rise 7.1% to HK$11.3 billion (US$1.4 billion), so it can take this punch and still turn a profit. Its shares are worth watching if the situation continues to improve in Hong Kong. There is a definite easing of tensions here since a pro-democracy landslide in district council elections on November 24. The police have also started to approve protest marches once again, which they had been banning again and again. I suspect that's under orders from the top after the U.S. Congress passed the Human Rights and Democracy Act. One of the new law's stipulations for issuing sanctions against a","Dec 6, 2019",https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/watch-these-2-transport-stocks-with-hong-kong-set-to-rally-15190340

The sale of a 7.465% stake in Cabo Verde Airlines’,"FURTHERAFRICA  “The process [which started in September] will run until 16 December and, as the Secretary of State has said, I can assure you that the sale process is proceeding quite positively,” Lima said. A total of 74,650 shares of former Transportes Aéreos de Cabo Verde (TACV) are being sold at a unit price of 1,457 escudos (about US$14.6). The process is part of the restructuring/privatisation of TACV, in which the first step was the sale of 51% of the company’s shares to Icelandair, after which the airline was renamed Cabo Verde Airlines (CVA). The Cabo Verde state now holds 49% of the shares, with the government choosing to sell 10% to Cape Verdean workers and emigrants up to a total of 100,000 shares and the remaining 39% to institutional investors (390,000 shares). A total of 91 employees of the former Cape Verdean public air carrier became shareholders of the company through the purchase of 25,350 shares in a transaction reserved for them from 1 July to 1 September.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Plane food is the divider of people. While some can’t get enough of the pre-packaged meals, others would rather go hungry than chow down on a tray of pre-prepped food stuff. But if you’re in the love it camp you’ll be pleased to hear that an airline has decided to open an entire restaurant that sells nothing but plane food. Yep, AirAsia has decided the on-board food it serves up is so popular it will literally fly [*groans*] out of the kitchen. The restaurant, dubbed Santan, which translates as “coconut milk,” will sell some meals for the bargain $3 (£2.29) a go, and all with the airline’s branding on the packaging. According to CNN, the airline started serving up dishes such as roasted chicken with teriyaki sauce at a fast-food style restaurant in a mall in Kuala Lumpur, earlier this week.

Other tray-based delights include satay skewers, beef rendan, Vietnamese Chicken Pho, plus Uncle Chin's Chicken Rice. “We have seen a significant appetite for our in-flight menu offerings beyond our flights across the region and this is our answer to that demand,” the firm’s general manager Catherine Goh said in a press release.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin should completely leave Google in order for the stock to record growth similar to Microsoft and Apple. By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment In the farewell letter announcing their exit from executive roles at Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin wrote that they will now “assume the role of proud parents – offering advice and love”. If Alphabet’s stock is to surge similarly to Apple and Microsoft after the exit of a founder and a long-serving CEO respectively, that’s not good enough. A better role for the two Google founders is absentee parents! They should give the new Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai complete freedom. As has been proven severally, the attachment founders have to their companies can work against investors’ interests. For instance, Microsoft’s obsession with dominating all spheres of personal computing as epitomized by Bill Gates and later the company’s employee number 30 Steve Ballmer saw the firm miss out in other technology niches it could have easily won.   It also led to flawed acquisition decisions and subsequently billions of dollars down the drain. It took a fresh pair of eyes, or at least a different perspective in the person of Satya Nadella to refocus the company on its company’s strengths, admit defeat in certain areas and get rid of the deadwood.

The Dow Jones enjoyed a monster rally on Friday as the stars aligned in the jobs data and Dow bulls bet on a last-minute tariff breakthrough. By: Francois Aure | Email | Leave a comment A 335-point surge in the Dow Jones helped the index rocket back closer toward record highs on Friday. The stock market rally was powered by jobs data, consumer sentiment, and optimism around the state of trade talks between the US and China. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping both have a vested interest in making a deal, as China’s tariff reduction gift on US soybeans shows. Despite the optimism, analysts at Nordea believe the jobs data could have peaked. They warn that underlying indicators hint at upcoming weakness. All three of the major US stock market indices gained around 1% to close the week, as Friday’s jobs report sent the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq climbing back toward record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 335 points or 1.12% to 28,012.79. The S&P 500 rose 29.74 points or 0.95% to 3,147.17. The Nasdaq split the difference, gaining 89.1 points or 1.04% to reach 8,659.80. Unsurprisingly given the rally in the stock market, the price of gold was under severe pressure, losing more than 1.2% as investors piled into risk assets. Crude oil rallied around 1.3% after OPEC committed to support prices with sustained cuts.

We recently met Mr Ajay Singh, CMD of","By Edelweiss Finance We recently met Mr Ajay Singh, CMD of Spicejet (SJ) and were enthused by his plans to leverage the near-term weakness in the industry to improve the airline’s profitability. His key perspectives: B-737 Max: A renegotiation of Max orders with Boeing for higher discount is on the anvil, which will boost sale and lease-back gains. Being the largest 737 Max customer globally with 200 plus plane orders, we believe, imparts SJ significant leverage in potential renegotiation; Liquidity: With robust cash collection from advance ticket sales, especially during the peak December quarter, SJ does not anticipate near-term liquidity constraints; and Yields: SJ’s yields improved in November as fare hikes did notimpact demand. We expect significant boost to profitability as SJ replaces older 737 NG with 15% higher fuel efficient and lower maintenance costMax planes in Q4FY20. Mr Singh expects 737 Max deliveries to commence during Q4FY20, which should boost profitability due to their higher fuel efficiency (15%), seat capacity and lower maintenance costs. SJ continues to use forward ticket sales to boost cash collection and anticipates adequate liquidity without raising further capital. The company also expects to recover profits foregone/costs incurred due to 737 Max grounding from Boeing, which will add to liquidity. With yield environment improving in November, it expects to turn profitable in Q3FY20 aided by lower fuel prices. We expect yields to remain flat YoY in Q3FY20. We expect SJ to overtake Indigo in passenger growth (FY20: 44% versus 26%) with take- over of Jet’s aircraft. Non-fuel CASK gap versus Indigo has narrowed to 5% in Q2FY20, which is ahead of our estimate. Despite this, SJ trades at 35% discount to Indigo, at 4.1x FY21E EV/EBITDAR.

13,Does Weather Affect the Stock Market?,Does Weather Affect the Stock Market?. . KEY TAKEAWAYS. What the Research Says. The Problem With Empiricism. Theories. Compete Risk,"Despite the best efforts of many highly trained economists and market specialists, there is no widespread consensus about how, or even if, weather affects the performance of the stock market. It seems like commonsense that it must have some impact, since weather is a ubiquitous phenomenon from which traders are never fully isolated. On the other hand, there isn't a clear-cut, logical reason to expect that rain on Wall Street or a hurricane in Mexico should systematically change valuations or trader optimism. Ultimately it's an interesting question, but one that financial economics isn't really equipped to answer. As a practical matter, it isn't difficult to test the correlation between stock market performance and weather pattern data. Meteorologists and climatologists chart everything from average sunshine to ocean currents, and stock market performance is a matter of public record. The trick is trying to pick the right data to compare. Peer-reviewed studies have disparate and conflicting results. One famous example was ""Weather-Induced Mood, Institutional Investors, and Stock Returns,"" which came out of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 2014. It found that relatively cloudier days increased perceived overpricing in individual stocks and, subsequently, led to more selling by institutions.1 ""Stock Returns and The Weather Effect"" was published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 1980. It seemed to find a very large impact factor, 3.72, under what was referred to as a ""calendar time hypothesis."" However, further review found that weather was a much smaller predictive variable than whether or not the trading day was a Monday. Another study, ""Stocks and the Weather: An Exercise in Data Mining or Yet Another Capital Market Anomaly?"" appeared in Empirical Economics in 1997. This study attempted to replicate a 1993 study that showed that stock prices were ""systematically affected by the weather."" The 1997 study could not reject the null hypothesis, ultimately conceding ""that no systematic relationship seemed to exist.""2 The scientific method works wonderfully in physics or chemistry, where independent tests are controlled and variables are isolated, but nobody can run controlled tests on the ecosystem or the global economy. The systems are too large to replicate and too monstrously complex to fully understand. Data has its limits, and the best a market analyst can hope for is to show correlation, not causation. Most causal models in economics or environmental science are regression-based. Modelers have to identify which factors seem relevant or irrelevant,","Dec 6, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/111015/does-weather-affect-stock-market.asp
