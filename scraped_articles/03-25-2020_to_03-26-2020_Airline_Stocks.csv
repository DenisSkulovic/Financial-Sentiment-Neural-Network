0,Airline Stocks Rally on Senate Passage of Stimulus Bill | Barron's,Airline Stocks Rally on Senate Passage of Stimulus Bill. Newsletter Sign-up. Barron's Tech. Here’s BofA’s List of 4 Enterprise Software,"  Airline stocks continued to rally Thursday after the Senate passed a $2 trillion stimulus bill that included more than $50 billion in grants, loans, and tax breaks for passenger and cargo carriers. Air travel isn’t likely to recover soon. But the stocks could continue to climb as the risk of bankruptcies and a liquidity crunch fades. The Cares Act that passed the Senate on Wednesday provides $33 billion in grants for airlines to make payrolls, including $25 billion for passenger carriers, $4 billion for cargo operators such as FedEx (ticker: FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and $3 billion for contractors. The bill also makes $29 billion in loans available, providing a liquidity backstop if private capital markets freeze up. And it includes waivers on fuel and excise taxes through 2020. The Cares bill still has to pass the House, which is expected to approve it by unanimous consent on Friday. Not every airline is likely to take the aid, which comes with a variety of strings attached, including limits on dividends and share buybacks, and potential equity stakes by the U.S. Treasury. But it gives the industry breathing room to maintain operations, and it avoids the dire scenario of airlines filing for bankruptcy protection if private credit markets were to dry up. ”The existence of the program itself is very bullish cause it allows lenders to think about the industry surviving,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon told Barron’s. The lending backstop should help airlines pledge unencumbered assets like planes as collateral against loans—raising the value of the assets due to lower bankruptcy risk. That backstop also reduces some equity risk since solvency becomes less of an imminent concern. A weekly guide to our best stories on technology, disruption, and the people and stocks in the middle of it all. It’s still too early to know which carriers will take federal aid and what form it will take in each case. Loans will have to be repaid at a cost to equity owners. Grants may come with equity stakes by the federal government. The package is designed so that airlines take as little as possible and only as a last resort, Vernon says. Airlines were close to grounding their fleets due to the steep drop in air traffic caused by the coronavirus. The industry couldn’t sustain operations at its current scale of aircraft and employees with revenue down 50%","Mar 26, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-stocks-rally-on-senate-passage-of-stimulus-bill-51585237829

2,Airline stocks fall from coronavirus | Morningstar,"Airline stocks fall from coronavirus. But they will soar again, and investors will want to get aboard for continued growth","   Editor's note: Read the latest on how the coronavirus is rattling the markets and what you can do to navigate it. The coronavirus outbreak, travel bans and spooked travellers abandoning their travel plans are wreaking havoc on the airline industry. The SARS epidemic in 2003 cost global airlines a whopping US$7 billion, but financial hit from the COVD-19 outbreak will certainly surpass that of SARS, according to Morningstar equity analyst, Ivan Su. According to the world airline association The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the coronavirus outbreak could cost airlines as much as US$30 billion in revenue. It’s little surprise that the airline stocks are amongst the hardest hammered as stocks within the wider travel industry that continues to nosedive. “Global air traffic has materially slowed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which we expect will adversely affect near-term revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows,” says Morningstar Equity Analyst, Burkett Huey. The far and fast fall of airline stocks from their all-time highs has created attractive openings for investors looking for value opportunities. Beyond the short-term headwind, though, the airline industry has secular long-term tailwinds supporting its cheery outlook. The global airline industry is forecasted by IATA to net US$29.3 billion in profit in 2020 as supportive central bank and fiscal policies worldwide lower the risk of economic weakness. While those 2020 profit numbers may need revision, the following airlines are well-positioned to benefit from long-term industry trends once the virus frenzy blows over.   Leading U.S. carrier, United Airlines (UAL) operates more than 4,500 daily flights to five continents. The airline’s hubs include San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, and Washington, D.C. In 2018, United clocked US$41.3 billion in revenue. The postrecession shakeout and wave of consolidation allowed leading U.S. airlines to “capture nearly 80% of the domestic market, ushering in record profit margins and consistent economic profits,” says a Morningstar equity report, noting that airline profit margins expand when oil price fall fares rise. CEO Oscar Munoz and president Scott Kirby have been taking measures to improve profitability. “In shifting strategies, United aims to improve network breadth, or connections to small cities, increase daily flights to spokes from hubs, and take advantage of the benefits of upgauging,” says Huey, adding that the strategy could ramp up system capacity and “catch up with Delta and American by offering nonstop service to","Mar 25, 2020",https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/200506/airline-stocks-fall-from-coronavirus.aspx
3,Why Shares of Airlines Are Soaring Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Airlines Are Soaring Today. The industry's $50 billion bailout appears within reach.. What happened. So what. Now,"   Airline stocks were gaining altitude on Wednesday after the White House and Congress overnight announced a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package. The deal includes $50 billion for U.S. passenger and cargo airlines, which should help the companies weather the severe travel slowdown caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) were each up more than 30% as of 1 p.m. EDT today, while shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were all up more than 15%, and both Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) were up more than 8%. Few industries have been hit harder by the pandemic than the airlines, with travel demand disappearing overnight and ticket sales expected to remain slow through the summer at least. Absent assistance, the companies are facing tough decisions as revenue has plummeted. Delta, for example, expects 2020 second-quarter revenue to be down 80% year over year, and it is currently burning through $350 million per week. Even the healthiest U.S. carriers have lost more than 40% of their value over the last month as investors braced for potential bankruptcies or failures. The airlines have asked the government for help, rallying employees to lobby lawmakers in hopes of winning a package of grants and loan guarantees to help weather the storm. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The airlines got their wish Wednesday when lawmakers reached a tentative agreement on a stimulus package that would provide help to the industry. The bailout does come with some stipulations, but they are much more manageable than some proposals floated in recent weeks, including talk that the government should take major equity stakes in the carriers. Any company receiving government loans as part of the stimulus bill would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan, plus potentially additional time up to a year. It would also be forced to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The terms would place limitations on the companies in the near term but would not prevent them from tapping equity markets and other sources of private capital in the future. It's worth noting that as of this writing, the stimulus plan still had not been signed into law. It appears likely to be done by end of day","Mar 25, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/25/timesensitive-why-shares-of-airlines-are-soaring-t.aspx
4,Why Airline Shares Are Up Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Up Today. The Cares Act should give the sector the runway it needs to get through,"   Shares of airlines on Thursday traded up for the third straight day as investors continue to applaud the $2 trillion economic relief package making its way through Congress. Airlines are set to receive about $50 billion in aid as part of the package, which hopefully will be enough to get them through the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic-related travel slowdown. Shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) all opened up more than 10% on Thursday, and shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) traded up 9%. All have retreated somewhat as the day went on but remain in the green as of 2:45 pm. The airlines were among the hardest hit sectors due to the pandemic, with travel demand evaporating overnight as the virus spread globally. Carriers have responded by cutting flights, freezing hiring, and grounding planes, but no amount of cutting is likely to be enough when revenue is supposed to drop by 80% or more. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The so-called Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, ""CARES Act,"" offers assistance to try to deaden the blow and allow airlines to avoid mass layoffs or bankruptcy. Commercial airlines will receive up to $25 billion in loans and loan guarantees, and have access to another $25 billion in grants. The help comes with conditions limiting share buybacks and executive compensation for as long as the loans are outstanding, and the grants might be tied to an equity or warrant issuance. But despite those terms, investors have been celebrating in recent days because the assistance should help airlines to work with private lenders and other counter-parties to access additional private-sector liquidity. Even with the rally this week these shares are still off between 15% and 48% over the last month. The airlines are still priced for an extended downturn at best, and a bankruptcy at worst, and with the government backstop finally arriving, it might be a good time to look for buying opportunities. I think it is safe to buy airlines despite the continued pandemic uncertainty. Just be picky about buying best-of-breed companies, and be warned that as long as the uncertainty remains it is likely volatility will eventually return to the sector.

But the business environment does not warrant this surge. By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. U.S. airline stocks are one of the beneficiaries of the $2 trillion stimulus package that congressional leaders struck early this morning. Investors cheered the news that airlines would get $25 billion in direct assistance. Air cargo carriers will receive $4 billion. “Big Three” airlines American, Delta, and United have seen their share prices soar over the past two days, primarily due to optimism over the stimulus package. Airline stock investors should enjoy the rally while it lasts.   While the financial aid will plug the cash shortfall pummelling some of the airlines, the business environment isn’t getting better. And the coronavirus pandemic is only getting worse. Per FlightStats, flight cancellations are mounting. Over the past few days, the number of canceled flights in the U.S. has averaged 9,000 daily. More than 60,000 flights in the U.S. have been canceled over the past month, while 103,000 more have been delayed. This massive revenue loss will only get worse as the coronavirus case toll increases in the United States. With borders closing around the globe, domestic travel was the sector’s last refuge. But even this lifeline is at risk due to measures designed to check the spread of COVID-19. Alaska, Florida, and Hawaii have ordered all visitors and residents arriving at state airports to undertake a 14-day self-quarantine, a move","Mar 25, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/this-airline-stock-surge-is-nothing-but-a-suckers-rally/
6,LUV Stock Has the Most Potential Among Airline Stocks | InvestorPlace,"Southwest Stock May Be Worth Some Love. For the daring, LUV stock is probably the best name to own in"," The travel and leisure industry has been ground zero for stock price erosion at the hands of the coronavirus from China. One of the epicenters of disaster has been airline equities, including Southwest Air (NYSE:LUV). But LUV stock may be worth embracing when fears of the virus abate.  Markets rallied on Tuesday, Mar. 24 amid hopes that Congress and the White House are finally nearing an agreement on a stimulus package, $25 billion of which would be allocated to the airline industry. The Senate approved the deal last night.   Those headlines sent Southwest soaring by 11.65% on nearly double the average daily volume yesterday and another 7% today. Underscoring the weakness of airline stocks this month, Southwest is still sporting a loss of 22% this year. Big one-day rallies are hallmarks of bear markets, and it may be too early to say that airline stocks have capitulated. Further,  it should not be ignored that Southwest yesterday said that it’s canceling 1,500 flights per day starting this Friday due to waning demand. That’s substantially higher than the 1,000 cancellations that it had previously forecast. For investors looking to bottom fish with airline stocks, Southwest is a good one to consider, due to its better-by-comparison balance sheet, among other factors. Analysts are acknowledging the attractiveness of LUV stock; two analysts upgraded the shares on Mar. 23 to the equivalent of “buy” ratings. However, the coronavirus situation is fluid, meaning there’s more to the story. Unfortunately, there is a template for how the airline industry weathers these storms: the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. A study by professors at the University of Hawaii and UNLV notes, not surprisingly, that in the aftermath of 9/11, demand for plane tickets plunged by staggering percentages. Southwest CEO Gary Kelley recently made comparisons between the coronavirus situation and 9/11, and those comparisons look accurate. And as was the case back then, the government will be extending lifelines to airlines to assist the industry through a turbulent time. What’s critical this time around is how the government deploys capital among airlines and how  effectively the industry uses the capital.

Coronavirus Live Updates: The latest COVID-19","BY ALAN BOYLE on March 25, 2020 at 10:51 am Even as Boeing begins a 14-day production shutdown in the Puget Sound due to the coronavirus outbreak, the aerospace giant is in line for a financial booster shot, thanks to provisions in the $2 trillion relief package drawn up in the Senate. Boeing’s stock ended the trading session with a 24% gain. Airline stocks rose as well, thanks to $50 billion in promised loans and grants for passenger airlines, and another $8 billion for cargo carriers. The Senate bill, which hasn’t yet come up for a vote and could still undergo revision, doesn’t specifically call out Boeing. But it does set aside $17 billion in loans for businesses that are considered “critical to maintaining national security.” Sources told The Washington Post that this provision was meant to cover Boeing’s needs, although other companies could be eligible for some of that aid. That $17 billion by itself doesn’t fully address Boeing’s request for $60 billion in assistance. Other sources of funding — public as well as private — could fill the gap. Boeing CEO David Calhoun signaled that the company had other options for getting through its current financial troubles during a Fox News interview on Tuesday. When Calhoun was asked about giving the federal government an equity stake in the company in exchange for receiving assistance, he said he didn’t care for the idea. “If they force it, we just look at all the other options, and we’ve got plenty of them,” Calhoun said. Boeing has been dealing with coronavirus-related setbacks that range from air travel restrictions to sick employees in the Puget Sound region, which has been hit particularly hard by the outbreak. As of today, the company is suspending airplane production operations for 14 days at its factories in Everett and Renton, as well as its airplane maintenance operations at Moses Lake in Central Washington. The outbreak isn’t Boeing’s only challenge. It’s also dealing with the continued worldwide grounding of its 737 MAX airplanes, which led to the suspension of 737 MAX production in Renton in January. Even with today’s upward jump, Boeing’s share price is less than half of what it was at the start of the year.

What assets does it have, and how productive are they in generating earnings?Singapore Airlines Ltd.’s announcement Friday of a shock-and-awe sale of new shares and convertible bonds worth up to S$15 billion ($10.5 billion) suggests that the clues about who will survive the virus-induced crisis sweeping the airline industry are further back.Don’t look to the balance sheet and statements of income and cashflows: The answer, as we’ve argued, is buried in the list of major shareholders that most companies include toward the end of their annual reports.There isn’t an airline on the planet that would be able to hunker down and survive the worst-case scenario for the Covid-19 pandemic — an 18-month-plus shutdown of much of the global aviation industry.Take one rough-and-ready measure, the cash ratio, which is the ability to pay for liabilities over the next 12 months out of cash and easily sold securities. Of the 29 largest carriers by revenue, not a single airline can boast a cash ratio higher than one, meaning they’d all run short of money before satisfying their creditors.If less reliable short-term assets such as receivables and inventories are deployed, things improve a little, bringing Ryanair Holdings Plc, Japan Airlines Co., ANA Holdings Inc. and Eva Airways Corp. above one.Alternatively, if you can cut general operating expenses and aircraft lease liabilities by, say, 60% and assume that all prepaid tickets are refunded with no drain on net assets, you can add Air Canada, IAG SA, JetBlue Airways Corp., Alaska Air Group Inc., and Southwest Airlines Co. to that group. On that sort of adjusted cash ratio, all of those carriers would have enough funds to see them through the year — but the rest of the global airline industry would go to the wall.That’s why having a rich patron is more","Mar 27, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/2618.TW/

Get our latest research that relates to,"Alan Joyce, CEO of Australia’s flagship carrier Qantas Airways, has never seen anything like it. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been “the single biggest shock that global aviation has ever experienced,” he said in a recent memo to the airline’s 30,000 staff members.  Joyce’s message rings loud and clear. Due to global travel restrictions in the days since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a pandemic, airlines have been seeing more cancellations than bookings, forcing them to slash capacity and send staff home. The decline in demand as a result of the spread of COVID-19 could end up being double the decline from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002 and 2003, according to travel research firm Tourism Economics. This implies 16 million lost passengers, which is more than the multi-year impact following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Like most of the rest of the market, domestic airline stocks have sold off, with United dropping the most at negative 74 percent year-to-date through March 19. Southwest was down the least, falling 38 percent over the same period, due to its having far less international exposure as well as a stronger balance sheet than its larger peers. The virus, according to United CEO Oscar Munoz, has created “an unprecedented challenge.” Be that as it may, I see it as having created an attractive buying opportunity. Air travel isn’t going away. At some point, the threat of the coronavirus will subside, and people will once again need to quickly get from point A to point B, either for business or leisure. Perhaps we’ll fly in rockets in the future, or rely on Star Trek-style beam technology, but for now, the only thing that can provide that sort of speed and dependability is a passenger jet. I’m not in any way negating the severity of COVID-19 or the economic mayhem it’s caused. But in all fairness, this is not the first major headwind that global airlines have been up against. The truth is that air travel has proved to be remarkably resilient to many external shocks, whether they be oil crises, wars, terrorist attacks or, yes, pandemics. Such events may have temporarily halted the increase in the number of passengers that take to the skies every year, but once the crisis was behind us, growth tended to resume.
