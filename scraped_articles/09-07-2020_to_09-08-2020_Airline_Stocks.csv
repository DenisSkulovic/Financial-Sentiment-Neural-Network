3,Why Airline Shares Were Up Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Were Up Today. Americans took to the skies over the Labor Day weekend.. What happened. So what.,"   Shares of most airlines were in the green on Tuesday, a day when the S&P 500 fell more than 2%, on data indicating that Americans took to the skies over the Labor Day holiday. Two leisure-focused discounters, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), led the sector higher, climbing as much as 6.3% and 5.9%, respectively, in mid-day trading before giving back some of those gains as the day went on. Airline stocks have had a difficult year in 2020, weighed down by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on travel demand. Second-quarter revenue for the industry was down 80% year over year, and the carriers do not expect much of a rebound until there is a vaccine. The airlines do have cash stockpiled to ride out a downturn, but we are going to have to see some signs of improvement in the months to come to ensure that no company runs into liquidity issues. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The holiday weekend in the U.S. brought some positive news. More than 900,000 passengers traveled through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints on Friday, Sept. 4, and on Monday, Sept. 7. Friday's was the highest single-day number since March 17, and a significant improvement from early April when fewer than 100,000 passengers were screened on some days. JetBlue and Spirit shares did particularly well in part because all indications are a lot of that business was leisure traffic to Florida, where Spirit is based and JetBlue has major operations. The two airlines are also focused on vacation travel, and not business, and are set up to benefit from a surge in tourist demand. Spirit in particular is an intriguing stock for investors with a strong tolerance for risk. The airline has some of the lowest unit costs in the business, and is well positioned to use low fares to stimulate demand. Traffic was up over the holiday weekend, but the daily volumes were still half of what they were the same days a year prior. And Labor Day also marks the end of the summer vacation season, meaning a lot of that tourism travel demand is likely to dry up. With business travel still nearly non-existent, the airlines are making plans to cut costs and shrink heading into autumn. Investors would be well served to focus more on the long-term trends than the day-to-day traffic flows.

4,Wheels Up! Airlines and Travel Stocks Have Taken Off on Pent-Up Demand | ETF Trends,Wheels Up! Airlines and Travel Stocks Have Taken Off on Pent-Up Demand. 2021 Is Going to Be All About Travel:,"By Frank Holmes, CIO and CEO, U.S. Global Investors As you may know by now, stocks just had their best August in more than 30 years. The S&P 500 Index gained 7 percent, the most for the eighth calendar month since 1986, around the same time that Gordon Gekko raided corporations in Oliver Stone’s Wall Street. This is highly positive, as it means investors are betting that a possible vaccine for the coronavirus could be made available sooner rather than later. The head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Stephen Hahn, said on Sunday he is willing to authorize a vaccine before Phase Three clinical trials were complete. Tech stocks have been responsible for much of the market’s gains this year, but August saw a new crop of big gainers. Travel stocks—including airlines, cruise lines and hotels—were among the best performing equities during the month as new daily COVID-19 cases have declined in the U.S. from their mid-July highs. The NYSE Arca Airline Index rose an incredible 17.20 percent, its biggest one-month gain since January 2012.  Royal Caribbean was the top performer of the bunch at 41 percent, followed by MGM Resorts at 40 percent and Norwegian at 25 percent—all representing industries that have been hardest hit by the pandemic. The five biggest airlines in the U.S.—Delta, Southwest, American, United and Alaska—saw double-digit growth in August, even as federal aid is soon to run out. However, President Donald Trump said recently that he supports additional assistance to protect airline workers. “We’ll be helping the airlines. You have to help the airlines,” Trump said from the White House Tuesday. What that help might look like is unclear at the moment, but Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows claimed last week that Trump is considering an executive order to bypass Congressional lawmakers, which have still not agreed on a second major coronavirus relief package. I agree with what Investment U’s Matthew Carr wrote this week, that “2021 is going to be all about travel. It’s going to be all about experiences. There will be a year’s worth of pent-up wanderlust that needs to be released.” We’re already seeing some of that pent-up travel demand being acted upon. The number of people flying commercial in the U.S. has continued to recover from the mid-April lows, with more than 807,000 passengers screened by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on Sunday, August 30.","Sep 7, 2020",https://www.etftrends.com/wheels-up-airlines-and-travel-stocks-have-taken-off-on-pent-up-demand/

15,Stock Market Crash 2.0: Warren Buffett’s Perfect Storm Is Here - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Stock Market Crash 2.0: Warren Buffett’s Perfect Storm Is Here. Warren Buffett,"      Andrew Button | September 7, 2020 | More on: QSR QSR In the turbulent 2020 stock market, Warren Buffett has been playing it unusually safe. Selling more stocks that he’s buying, he seems to think that cash is preferable to stocks right now. In August, filings revealed that Buffett’s cash pile had soared to $147 billion. That was partially due to accumulating dividends, but also due to the Oracle selling shares. In Q1, Buffett sold out of airline stocks entirely, shedding his positions in Delta and others. Other high profile sales included banks and restaurant stocks. While Buffett hasn’t come out and said it yet, his moves suggest he’s bracing for a perfect storm that could crash the stock market. Selling stocks and hoarding cash, he’s being decidedly bearish. Not only that, but you can read some past statements of his as indicating that the current market is overvalued. I’ll explore those statements in just a minute. First, though, let’s evaluate what Buffett has been up to this year. In 2020 so far, Warren Buffett has been a net seller of stocks. That’s significant because Buffett has been investing professionally since the 1950s, and until now had never been a net seller. In the time Buffett has been managing money professionally, we’ve seen several huge crashes like those in 1987, 2001 and 2008. None of those crashes were enough to make Buffett sell out of his holdings. The 2020 crash, on the other hand, did. Earlier this year, Buffett sold his entire stake in airlines and most of his stake in banks. It was an uncharacteristic move for Buffett, but when we look at some of Buffett’s past statements, it makes sense. In the past, Warren Buffett has touted his support for an equity valuation metric now called the Warren Buffett Indicator. In 2001, he said “it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.” The Warren Buffett Indicator is equity market cap divided by GDP. It shows how expensive stocks are relative to economic output. If this ratio gets too high, then it indicates that stocks are overvalued. As of September 5, the ratio sat at 1.83, or 183%. That’s higher than the historical norm, which tends to suggest that stocks are overheated. In fact, the Warren Buffett Indicator was getting high well before the COVID-19 market","Sep 7, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/09/07/stock-market-crash-2-0-warren-buffetts-perfect-storm-is-here/
16,JetBlue Rated Overweight as Morgan Stanley Bullish on Airlines Recovery - TheStreet,,"JetBlue Airways  (JBLU) - Get Report rose Tuesday after Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker began coverage of the stock with an overweight rating and a price target of $16 a share. That was part of his initiation of coverage of the U.S. airline industry with an “attractive” designation. “We are bullish on the timeline of recovery in airline traffic which underpins our attractive industry view and drives significant upside to our average price target,” Shanker wrote. JetBlue recently traded at $12.58, up 3.71%. The stock has dropped 33% so far this year. Passengers will return first to airlines with heavy exposure to domestic leisure travel, return to medium-distance flights and to airlines with strong customer loyalty programs and/or bargain fares, he said. Shanker anticipates a “relatively quick rebound in traffic,” with demand, as measured by revenue passenger miles, “returning to pre-Covid levels on a run-rate basis by late 2021-early 2022,” compared to the consensus estimate of 2023-2024. Shanker gave the following stocks overweight ratings: Southwest Airlines  (LUV) - Get Report, JetBlue, Delta Air Lines  (DAL) - Get Report and Allegiant Travel  (ALGT) - Get Report. He rated Alaska Air Group  (ALK) - Get Report equal weight and United Airlines  (UAL) - Get Report underweight. He called his ratings a ""barbell approach,"" with a bias toward low-cost carriers. JetBlue had a tough second quarter amid the coronavirus pandemic. Its revenue tumbled 90% in the period to $215 million from $2.105 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company posted a loss of $320 million, or $1.18 a share, in the latest quarter, down sharply from $179 million, or 59 cents a share, last year.

17,Get on Board JBLU Stock for a Complete Recovery Rally | InvestorPlace,Get on Board JetBlue Stock for a Complete Recovery Rally. JBLU stock price action is constructive. JBLU Stock Will Recover," Owning JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) stock makes for a viable long term thesis. This, in spite of all the difficulties that the airline industry still faces for as long as the novel coronavirus remains on the loose. The medical experts are hard at work developing vaccines and therapeutics. Meanwhile, people are still afraid so they are traveling only when it becomes absolutely necessary. As a result, JBLU stock and its cohort, while on the mend, are still 40% below their February levels. The good news is that they have had spurts of strength especially in May and into June. This shows the risk appetite for them is not dead. Back then the famed billionaire investor Warren Buffet had just given up on his airline stocks, but new fans emerged especially in Robinhood traders. The rally was impressive but didn’t last too long. They have settled a bit since then and remain great trading vehicles. Case in point: in July I wrote about the opportunity to go long JBLU stock and it delivered almost 20% shortly thereafter. More importantly the bulls have maintained a higher-low trend while they chip away at resistance. For as long as this continues, JetBlue remains a viable long term thesis. The bad thing is that the resistance has so far been a wall and much more hard work is necessary to tear it down. But the more times the bulls hit it, especially from a higher base, the more energy they gather for that. Eventually the buyers will prevail and burst through like a freight train. By then the sellers would be exhausted and the stock will over-shoot by about $3 per share. There will be resistance near $13.50 and this would also bring the battle to the June fail spot. Back then the stock collapsed almost 40% after the aforementioned great rally. The bulls and bears will have it out if and when JBLU stock returns to that $15 per share zone. Hopefully by then the scientists would have made great strides in their vaccine efforts. We won’t need the actual delivery of it, but rather at least have concrete availability dates. Travel and entertainment stocks are super sensitive to vaccine headlines as we’ve seen many time in recent weeks. Updates from Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) or Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) cause big spikes in airlines and hotels. Even stocks like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) soar on them.

Originally posted as,"September 8, 2020 · 2 min read Image source: Chimpinski,Krakenimages.com, Oleg Anisimov , OceanicWanderer - Shutterstock Morgan Stanley wants to let investors play among the stars (or at least the stratosphere): the bank’s analysts reckon now’s the time to buy US airline stocks. The Chairman of the Board (or at least the transport research team) sees a future in which coronavirus vaccines bring airline passengers back in bulk. In fact, Morgan Stanley predicts demand could return to pre-pandemic levels by late 2021 – two years sooner than most other forecasts. Against that backdrop, the investment bank’s betting domestic airlines with shorter routes and cheaper fares will recover first – and that those which were either previously very profitable or on that trajectory will end up back on top.


All the same, Morgan Stanley warned that a worsening pandemic could drive desperate carriers to slash prices – potentially causing a race to the bottom that would hit everybody’s profits. That risk may be why billionaire investor Warren Buffett sold all his airline stock holdings four months back… For markets: An uneven runway. The bank recommended on Tuesday that investors looking to follow its lead buy into both low-cost US carriers and the strongest of the country’s so-called “legacy” airlines – which its analysts believe is Delta Air Lines (tweet this). Investors across the Atlantic, meanwhile, might be minded to board the likes of Ryanair and Wizz Air: they’re currently adding more planes to their fleets even as larger European rivals struggle. Not only should demand for their short-haul routes recover faster than for rivals’ intercontinental fares, but they’ve also got more cash on hand. The bigger picture: Too big to flail? Some previously profitable high-flyers are running on fumes after six months up in the air. Troubled European airline group IAG – owner of Iberia and British Airways – is hoping to raise $3 billion from existing investors in order to help it weather the storm: it’s still only flying at 20% of its pre-pandemic level, with hefty overheads burning through $26 million a day.
