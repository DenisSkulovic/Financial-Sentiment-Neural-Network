2,Airline and travel stocks feel the impact of coronavirus,Airline and travel stocks feel the impact of coronavirus. Hundreds of planes grounded as demand falls. Labour surplus issues and,"ASX-listed airline and travel stocks have taken a pummelling as tightening travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic severely impact demand. Airlines around the globe have been slashing flight capacity with Virgin Australia Holdings (ASX: VAH) being the latest to announce plans to suspend all international flights until mid-June and cut domestic flight capacity in half. It follows Tuesday’s announcement that Qantas Airways (ASX: QAN) will cut international flights by around 90% until at least the end of May. The uncertainty of COVID-19’s continued spread and full impact also has earnings guidances on hold and investors on edge with many travel-related stocks losing half of their value over the past month. Virgin Australia today revealed it will suspend all international flights from 30 March to 14 June and reduce domestic capacity by 50% until 14 June. In addition, 53 aircraft have been temporarily grounded from the Virgin fleet. “We have entered an unprecedented time in the global aviation industry, which has required us to take significant action to responsibly manage our business while balancing traveller demands and supporting the wellbeing of Australians,” Virgin Australia chief executive officer and managing director Paul Scurrah said in a statement. “We have responded by making tough decisions which include reducing our domestic capacity and phasing in the temporary suspension of international flying for a period of two and a half months,” he added. Qantas’ plans to cut 90% of international capacity until the end of May (at a minimum) is up from its 23% reduction for the FY 2020 fourth quarter announced last week. In addition, the airline said it will reduce domestic capacity by about 60% over the same period. These large-scale reductions are equivalent to the grounding of around 150 aircraft, including almost all of Qantas’ wide-body fleet, the company stated. Likewise, Air New Zealand (ASX: AIZ) this week announced it will cut its long-haul (international) capacity by 85% “over the coming months” and will operate a minimal schedule to allow New Zealanders to return home and “to keep trade corridors with Asia and North America open”. Domestic flights will also be reduced by around 30% in April and May, the airline stated. The company went into suspension Wednesday morning pending a release on the financial and operational impact of the travel restrictions. According to Qantas, international travel demand has been impacted by the “severe quarantine requirements on people’s ability to travel","Mar 18, 2020",https://smallcaps.com.au/airline-travel-stocks-asx-feel-impact-coronavirus/
3,American Airlines spent $12 billion on stock buybacks during flush times. Now it says it needs a bailout,". . . . . . . . . This year’s Rose Bowl, one of the two CFP semifinal matchups,","  BUSINESSAIRLINES By Kyle Arnold 6:00 AM on Mar 18, 2020 CDT American Airlines’ $29 billion in debt and massive share buybacks are coming under increased scrutiny as the aviation industry looks for government aid to deal with tumbling sales from the coronavirus outbreak. U.S. airlines, including Fort Worth-based American, have asked Congress for $58 billion in direct aid and low- or no-interest loans to keep business afloat as travel demand deteriorates amid increasing restrictions on public life to deal with the spreading virus.   But it comes after years of airlines stockpiling debt and spending billions to drive up stock prices through buybacks. American Airlines has spent about $12.4 billion on stock repurchases since 2014. Southwest has spent $10.7 billion buying back stock. “If there is so much as a DIME of corporate bailout money in the next relief package, it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks,” said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, in a Twitter message. In a letter to government leaders and lawmakers this week, American CEO Doug Parker and union leaders said that the airline needs aid “with appropriate conditions.” According to reports, Congressional leaders have been discussing $50 billion in government aid entirely made up of zero or low-interest loans. Researchers have proven that being helpful to others releases dopamine — the “feel-good” chemical — in our brains and lights up the same... The biggest U.S. airlines, including American, United, Delta and Southwest, have spent 96% of free cash flows to repurchase stock during the past decade, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. All of the major airlines have announced in recent days that they’ll suspend stock buyback programs. Dallas tech billionaire Mark Cuban said share repurchases should also be revisited if a bailout package passes. “Let me also add, any public company that receives a bailout or significant funding should not be allowed, by law, to do stock buybacks EVER AGAIN as part of their agreement,” Cuban posted on Twitter. Now those airlines are asking for billions as the economy reels. President Donald Trump said this week that that federal money would be made available to help distressed airlines, which have seen a major downturn over the past month. “I don’t want to have stock buybacks,” Trump said Friday. “I don’t want some executive saying we are going to buy 200,000 shares of stocks.

4,Coronavirus prompts airline rout as carriers plead for billions in government aid,"Airlines’ historic rout deepens as they plead for billions in government aid, slash costs amid coronavirus. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","U.S. airline stocks plunged to new multi-year lows Wednesday as carriers further cut costs after coronavirus devastated demand for flights and they continue to plead for billions in government aid. Delta Air Lines said Wednesday that it plans to cut its flying by an unprecedented 70%, on a year-over-year basis, after March revenue fell nearly $2 billion short of the same month last year as bookings drop and cancellations pile up. The Atlanta-based carrier is also halting capital spending, including for new aircraft, and parking “at least” half of its fleet. April’s revenue drop could be even worse, Delta warned. The reduced flying will last “until demand starts to recover,” CEO Ed Bastian told employees. “Our international operation will take the largest reduction, with over 80% of flying reduced over the next two to three months,” he said. The airline industry has been among the hardest-hit industries amid the rapid spread of COVID-19, as consumers stay home, scrapping vacations and lucrative business travel. United, American, JetBlue, Southwest and others are, like Delta, slashing their flying, asking employees to take unpaid leave, freezing hiring and parking hundreds of planes, a trend that is weighing heavily on aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus. American, for example, it is offering workers up to 12 months of unpaid leave. Employees can also leave the company entirely and buy health insurance at the same premiums as staff if they have worked for the airline for 15 years or more. On Thursday, American said it secured a $1 billion delayed-draw loan to help shore up funds for the crisis and that it has $8.4 billion in available liquidity. But airlines say government support is needed to combat the drop in bookings. “These are extraordinary circumstances, and additional support is necessary to protect jobs and ensure that the flying public can continue to rely on our industry after the crisis ends,” Nate Gatten, American’s senior vice president for government affairs, wrote to employees late Wednesday. “The financial assistance we seek is to support our team members as we weather this unprecedented storm together.” American’s CEO Doug Parker traveled to Washington D.C. this week and has spoken with President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and several lawmakers, Gatten said. Despite airlines’ cost-cutting measures, executives signaled more pain is ahead as bookings drop precipitously.

5,"Coronavirus airline aid must include worker protections, unions say","‘No blank check’ for airlines seeking more than $50 billion in coronavirus aid, Democrats warn. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","The more than $50 billion in government aid U.S. airlines are seeking as the coronavirus ravages their businesses must include worker and consumer protections, Democratic lawmakers and labor unions said Tuesday. They criticized airlines for spending years of windfall profits buying back their own stock. “No blank check industry bailouts,” tweeted Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.  Airlines are reeling from what executives have called an unprecedented collapse in travel demand as COVID-19 spreads, prompting millions of Americans to stay at home. More than 5,000 cases of coronavirus have been detected so far in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said he is discussing with lawmakers a sprawling aid package that will include assistance for U.S. airlines. As a result of the virus, airlines are culling thousands of flights, parking airplanes, deferring orders and asking workers to take unpaid leave in a bid to preserve cash. U.S. airlines employ close to 750,000 people, according to federal data. Airlines’ requested aid includes $25 billion in direct grants — five times more than what they received following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — and it is crucial for the carriers, according to their lobbying group, Airlines for America, which represents American, Delta, United, Southwest and others. Congress has begun negotiations around a third emergency funding bill to address the pandemic. The bill is expected to include some form of industry aid, as well as protections for individuals and companies battling the virus. Labor unions and some Democratic lawmakers say that while the carriers didn’t cause the dire situation they’re now in, aid should come with some conditions. “We have told Congress that any funds for the aviation industry must come with strict rules,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents some 50,000 cabin crews at United, Alaska, Spirit and others. “That includes requiring employers across aviation to maintain pay and benefits for every worker. No taxpayer money for CEO bonuses, stock buybacks or dividends. No breaking contracts through bankruptcy.” Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., on Monday tweeted support of the framework laid out by Nelson. The four biggest U.S. carriers — Delta, American, Southwest and United — have collectively spent about $39 billion over the last five years buying back shares, according to a tally from S&P Dow Jones Indices.

NASDAQ. VOLATILITY.," It surprises nobody that Canadian airline stocks have been crushed during this latest market rout. After all, the sector has numerous things going against it. These companies suffer from low margins, high fixed costs, and massive capital needed to expand the fleet. Keeping planes safe costs a bunch of money, and unionization of staff makes it hard to lay folks off when times get rough. These factors combined to keep Canadian airline stocks cheap for years. It was only recently these companies started to do really well. But it’s not all bad news. In fact, some will argue the top Canadian airline stocks are poised to rebound just as soon as COVID-19 concerns are behind us. After a few weeks at stuck at home, I know I’ll be ready to travel again. With this upside potential in mind, let’s take a closer look at two different Canadian airline stocks to see whether these companies are a good value today. Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) is our nation’s largest airline and up until a few weeks ago was one of the Toronto Stock Exchange‘s top-performing stocks. Shares have since imploded, falling more than 50% in just over a month. The stock now trades for around $25; earnings over the last 12 months were well over $5 per share. It doesn’t take a math genius to see the stock is cheap on a trailing earnings basis. Bears will argue trailing earnings are meaningless in this situation, an assessment I agree with except for one important caveat. These earnings show Air Canada’s earning power when times are good. And, as you can see, it’s substantial. That’s good news when this crisis passes. The issue is whether the largest of the Canadian airline stocks has the balance sheet strength to weather this storm. As of December 31, the company was sitting on nearly $6 billion of cash and short-term investments, which seems like a lot. It also has $8 billion in long-term debt, however.

Airline stocks slide as North American border closes for non-essential travel due to COVID-19. Article Sidebar.,"Meanwhile, both Transat and Porter said they would be suspending flights Canadian airlines slashed flight schedules as their stocks took another plunge on Wednesday after the U.S. and Canada announced plans to close the border to non-essential travel. Air Canada, Canada’s largest airline, announced it will gradually suspend its international and U.S. flights by March 31 and drastically cut its domestic and cross-border schedules until at least April 30. While it will operate flights in the short term to repatriate travellers stuck abroad, after April 1 it plans to cut the number of airports it services internationally to six from 101; in the United States to 13 from 53; and domestically to 40 airports from 62. Chief executive Calin Rovinescu described the travel restrictions as understandable but cataclysmic for the airline industry. “We are working around the clock to deal with the impact for our customers and our business of the various travel restrictions that are being made by governments at unprecedented speed without advance warning,” he said in a statement. Air Canada is working with the federal government to figure out how to maintain essential operations, bring as many Canadians home as possible, including through charter flights, and to maintain the shipment of goods and cargo. Air Canada’s stock fell nearly 20 per cent Wednesday to close at $12.90 and vacation airline Transat A.T.’s stock dipped 2 per cent to $5.88 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. During the volatile trading day, Air Canada’s stock fell as much as 40 per cent and Transat’s dropped 20 per cent. Air Canada shares have fallen about 75 per cent since Jan. 1. Transat announced Wednesday it will gradually suspend flights until April 30 and temporarily lay off a “significant” portion of its employees in response to COVID-19 border closures that have decimated demand for international flights. The Montreal-based airline said it will reduce work hours and salaries for remaining employees and executives as it focuses on repatriating customers to their home countries. Porter Airlines Inc. followed suit, announcing it will halt all operations end of day on Friday, March 20 until June 1. Both actions follow similar moves by Sunwing Vacations and WestJet Airlines Ltd., which cancelled flights to international and U.S. destinations earlier this week.

8,Why Airline Shares Are Declining Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Declining Today. To bail out or not to bail out: That is the question.. What happened.,"   Airline stocks continued their plunge at the open on Tuesday before coming back somewhat on hopes that U.S. lawmakers would follow through on pledges to provide the industry with some sort of financial relief. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) were down more than 13%, while shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) were both down single-digits. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) have been up 16% and down 7% on a volatile day. The airline sector has been hit hard by the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, with global travel demand evaporating overnight. The airlines have reacted by freezing hiring, cutting schedules, and grounding aircraft, but there is a growing fear that government action is needed to avoid a flood of bankruptcy filings. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. White House officials have expressed support for some sort of an industry backstop, with talk of upward of $50 billion in grants and loan guarantees. But the industry has also received significant pushback from lawmakers who see it as a bailout for companies ill prepared for bad times. And some union leaders have pushed Congress to assist workers directly instead of giving money to corporations. The uncertainty has prevented airline stocks from rallying on the assistance talk, and has investors continuing to try to pick winners and losers in the sector. American remains on close watch because the company has the most debt among U.S. airlines. Hawaiian, meanwhile, is a niche carrier highly dependent on vacation travel to its home state and can ill afford a prolonged downturn that eats into consumer spending. It is important to note that the airlines all have some runway ahead of them, and I still believe the industry can weather the storm without bankruptcies. The argument for an assistance package now is that you don't want to wait until it is needed, and that makes sense. But we are not on the verge of collapse, and investors should not treat the stocks as if they are. If nothing else, a show of government support should help reassure airline suppliers, creditors, and counterparties that the companies can make it through the downturn, which should help the airlines negotiate extensions, raise new debt, and take other actions to get through the crisis. Still, nothing short of headlines that the pandemic has been contained and the economy is recovering will truly reassure investors, and that","Mar 17, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/17/why-airline-shares-are-falling-today.aspx

10,US airlines used up spare cash buying back shares - BBC News,US airlines used up spare cash buying back shares. Related Topics. More on this story. Top Stories. Features. Elsewhere on,"America's biggest airlines have called on Washington for more than $50bn (£41bn) in aid as they suffer the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. US President Donald Trump on Monday pledged to back the industry ""100%"". But figures suggest major carriers spent almost all their spare cash in the last decade buying back their own shares. It comes as the airline industry is facing huge losses and widespread layoffs as passengers stay at home. Data revealed by Bloomberg show major airlines including United and American Airlines used up an average 96% of their spare cash buying back their own shares. Companies buy back their own shares for a number of reasons. Some have built up big cash piles that they don't want to sit on so spend the money buying back previously issued shares. This helps them reduce their costs as they have fewer shareholders to pay dividends to. Buying back stocks can also push up the company's share price, which many investors use to measure a company's performance. American Airlines led the pack, buying back more than $12.5 billion of its own shares from 2010 to 2019, according to Bloomberg figures. United Airlines used 80% of its spare cash buying back its shares. The average S&P 500 Index company spent about 50% of its spare cash buying back its own shares during this period. With limited cash reserves and a significant drop in revenues expected, US airlines are looking for government assistance of more than $50bn. Plane maker Boeing is also one of the firms looking for short-term assistance. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said last week that airlines are ""on top of the list"" for government help.

Still, selling may be overdone, and an airline sector-related exchange traded fund may offer a cheap entry point for bargain hunters seeking a long-term opportunity. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS C) has declined 35.9% over the past month and was down another 15.0% on Thursday. The ETF has experienced massive trading volumes in the past few weeks, touching a record of 2.37 million shares on March 6. The activity remains elevated with another 1.5 million shares exchanging hands on Thursday. Meanwhile, the U.S. Global Jets ETF also saw inflows surge in the past two weeks, with net assets more than tripling to over $115 million.

Specifically, looking at the relative strength index, a measure in the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions, JETS was trading below its 14-day RSI for the airlines index, going back to 2001. “It shows that airline stocks right now are the most oversold since September 2001,” Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Global Investors, said in a note. The RSI hit 13.9 on March 3, the lowest it’s been since September 21, 2001, just days after 9/11, when the index was at 7.7. JETS currently trades at an RSI reading of 17.2, still well below the RSI reading of 30 that indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.","Mar 18, 2020",https://etfdb.com/multi-asset-channel/airline-etf-seems-like-bargain-play/

Airlines are begging for a bailout, but they've used 96% of their cash flow on buybacks over the past","   REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque  The Trump administration has responded to the airline industry's request and proposed a $50 billion bailout as part of its massive $1 trillion stimulus package. The ultimate goal is to jolt the American economy by flooding it with cash. Major airlines are reeling from massive wave of cancellations as Americans stay home and governments around the world implement travel bans to curb the spread of the coronavirus. ""We cannot afford to wait long for assistance,"" the trade association Airlines for America said in a statement, warning that some companies could be bankrupt by June.  But there's a catch. Over the past decade, major airlines — including Delta Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest — have used roughly 96% of their cash flow on stock buybacks, according to Bloomberg. By reducing share count, these repurchases have pushed stock prices higher. In the process, they've drawn criticism for how they've boosted shareholder returns without directly helping businesses.

We need to make sure money goes to workers — period."" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he wouldn’t support $50 billion in loans to airlines unless more conditions are attached. Along with “really severe limits on executive compensation,” Blumenthal said there should be “conditions that protect workers.” He said pilots and flight attendants should have “better working conditions” and higher pay and that airlines must “commit to do better” in terms of charges, fees, baggage handling and seat size. Earlier Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also targeted airline stock buybacks in comments on the Senate floor. The practice has attracted criticism from progressive Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after the airline industry requested a nearly $60 billion bailout from Congress this week, including $29 billion in grants and another $29 billion in loans or loan guarantees. “One of the reasons, let’s not forget, that many airlines are so short of cash right now is they spent billions on stock buybacks — money they had to send out when they should have been saving it for a rainy day, for their workers and customers,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “That issue should be addressed.” Later, Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told POLITICO that demands could also include limits on executive pay and provisions that would see taxpayers take on stock in airlines, similar to","Mar 18, 2020",https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/senate-dems-conditions-airline-aide-135824
17,Why Airline Shares Are Down Again Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Airline Shares Are Down Again Today. If a bailout doesn't materialize, it is going to get even uglier.. What","   Airline shares tumbled again on Wednesday amid a growing number of flight cancellations and the release of dire financials. The government has pledged to help, but there is no concrete plan in place. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) were all down more than 30% for the day in early afternoon trading, and shares of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) were both off more than 15%. By now it is well established that the airline sector has been hit hard by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, with global travel demand all but evaporating as the outbreak has spread. Airlines are scrambling to cut spending by freezing hiring and trimming schedules, with JetBlue on Wednesday the latest to announce cuts and Delta saying it would ground half its fleet. The pandemic is expected to cost the global industry more than $100 billion in lost revenue in 2020. JetBlue on Wednesday said that so far in March, it is taking in about $4 million in bookings daily, down from about $22 million daily in March 2019, while issuing more than $20 million per day in credits. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Although the U.S. sector is relatively healthy compared with many international airlines, those sorts of losses can't go on forever. White House officials have expressed support for some sort of an industry backstop, with talk of upward of $50 billion in grants and loan guarantees. But the industry has also received significant pushback from lawmakers and union leaders who see it as a bailout for companies ill prepared for bad times. Airline stocks were placed under added pressure midday after famed investor Bill Ackman, speaking on CNBC, said he believes all airlines will stop flying and hotels will shut down before the crisis is contained. That seemingly is already being priced into Hawaiian shares after Gov. David Ige of Hawaii called for a 30-day suspension of visitors to the state. With today's losses, all of these airlines except Southwest have lost half of their equity value over the past month, with United down 78% and Hawaiian down 72% year to date. It appears investors are bracing for multiple industry bankruptcies, and given the current situation and the outlook for further cuts, it is easy to understand why.

18,We should bail out airlines during the coronavirus pandemic—but on taxpayers’ terms,. We should bail out airlines during the coronavirus pandemic—but on taxpayers’ terms. Adie Tomer. Fellow - Metropolitan Policy Program.,"Guidance for the Brookings community and the public on our response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) » Learn more from Brookings scholars about the global response to coronavirus (COVID-19) » The coronavirus pandemic has thrown America’s aviation industry into genuine chaos. Planes are flying with only a handful of passengers. Terminal halls are desolate. Customs processes overwhelmed. But most Americans
don’t even fly once a year, meaning a struggling aviation industry can seem like a problem strictly for business travelers and select vacationers. Yet aviation is not a luxury industry. Vast segments of our economy are built on the expectation that tourists can fly to their destinations, businesses can host face-to-face meetings, and shippers can deliver the latest smartphones and fresh flowers to stores. Whether you board a commercial plane this year or not, aviation touches your daily life. That’s why we all need to worry about this shocking decline in aviation demand. In the immediate term, a specific set of large metropolitan areas could feel serious workforce impacts as airports, airlines, and freight companies struggle with severe liquidity crises. In the months to come, even after the virus is under control, a broken aviation industry could still make it impossible to return to economic normalcy. The aviation industry, financiers, customer rights groups, and the federal government will likely settle on some form of financial support—a bailout—for this essential industry. But will they focus on the right tactics? Viruses and aviation don’t mix well. Airports are queuing machines, placing people coming from miles apart into close proximity with one another: passing through security, buying food, boarding the plane, and, for international travelers, clearing customs (which, as we saw at U.S. airports after the newest travel bans were enacted, created a
fiasco). The coronavirus can also
live on metal, wood, and other hard surfaces that airports and airplanes have in abundance. Governments, airlines, and consumers know this. It’s why generous rebooking options, formal travel restrictions, and general customer awareness are now keeping people away from airports. U.S. airlines have already
started to cut domestic flights by around 30% and international ones by roughly 70%, with reductions expected to last at least until summer. We don’t yet have systemwide traveler data, but early numbers out of
Seattle and
Orlando suggest the industry will see much lower load factors (the share of seats filled with passengers) than
a year ago this month.  Less travel keeps us all safer in the","Mar 18, 2020",https://www.brookings.edu/research/we-should-bail-out-airlines-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-but-on-taxpayers-terms/
