Latest Markets Videos. Zacks.,"It is a well-documented fact that stocks in the airline space have not had a great time in 2019, to which we will soon bid adieu. Headwinds like lackluster cargo business due to reduced freight demand and trade tensions between the United States and China, and loss of revenues following flight cancellations arising out of the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets, have prevented the stocks from flying high this year. The Zacks Airline industry has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 Index so far this year. The industry has gained 14.5% on a year-to-date basis compared with the S&P 500’s appreciation of 27.2%.    Let’s delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the unimpressive performance of airline stocks in 2019. Challenges posed by the prolonged grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets have hurt their carriers. Notably, three U.S. carriers — Southwest Airlines LUV, American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL — have 34, 24 and 14 Boeing 737 MAX jets in their fleet, respectively. According to Forbes, a report by U.K.-based flight data information firm OAG has predicted that Boeing 737 Max’s grounding will hurt global airline industry revenues by $4.1 billion in 2019, including $600 million for the aforementioned U.S. airlines. As a reminder, all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded since March this year after they were involved in two fatal air crashes in different parts of the world over a span of five months apparently due to software malfunctioning. The grounding of the above-mentioned jets has resulted in reduced capacity and escalation of non-fuel unit costs, thereby limiting bottom-line growth. For example, American Airlines now expects its 2019 capacity to increase only about 1% over 2018 levels (earlier guidance had predicted an increase in the e in the 2-3% range). This reduction from the previous guidance is primarily due to the grounding of the company’s 737 MAX aircraft. Moreover, the carrier anticipates its full-year pre-tax income to be hurt by roughly $540 million due to the grounding. Moreover, decline in cargo revenues, the second-largest contributor to the top line of most carriers after passenger revenues, was another undesirable development in 2019. The decline was mostly due to lower volumes and yield. For example, at Delta Air Lines DAL, cargo revenues declined 13% year over year to $567 million in the first nine months of 2019.

4,"If You Invested $500 in Delta Airlines’ IPO, This Is How Much Money You'd Have Now | The Motley Fool","If You Invested $500 in Delta Airlines’ IPO, This Is How Much Money You'd Have Now. Shares of this airline","   Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) has come a long way from starting as a crop-dusting company in 1924. Deciding to purchase larger planes in 1928 and obtain routes for the United States Postal Service led Delta on a successful path until the September 11th terrorist attacks, high jet fuel prices, and increased competition from low-cost competitors pushed Delta into bankruptcy in 2005. Shortly afterward, shares of Delta became public during the launch of the IPO on May 1, 2007, at $20 per share.  Purchasing shares of a company on the first day of trading can provide additional risk and volatility, however, the risk was worth the reward for Delta shareholders holding shares for over 12 years. A shareholder investing $500 in Delta's initial shares would have received 25 shares in total. Fast-forward to today and those 25 shares would be worth $58.58 per share, worth $1,464.50. After removing the initial investment, a shareholder is sitting on a profit of $964.5. Including the $134.45 in dividends received, a shareholder's total profit would be $1,098.95 -- a 219.79% return on investment. Looking directly at share price appreciation, a shareholder would have gained a 9.37% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) -- beating the S&P 500's 6.61% CAGR during the same period.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Two high-flying opportunities are on Delta's doorstep, consisting of a new partnership with a South American airline and the recent $4 billion investment in a terminal at LaGuardia Airport in New York. Delta recently joined forces with LATAM Airlines in September -- an airline based in Latin America serving North and South America. Subject to approval, Delta will invest $1.9 billion in common shares of LATAM and an additional $350 million to support the partnership. Announcing that the partnership will show benefits to earnings per share during the ""next two years and that the transaction will not impact existing financial commitments to shareholders"" should make shareholders optimistic.  This partnership will allow Delta to provide routes to South America that wouldn't have been possible without the LATAM partnership -- allowing Delta to expand and develop a competitive position. Assuming the regulatory approval is smooth, Delta should see revenue performance in the next two years. Delta's management estimates an additional $1 billion annually from the partnership. In addition, Delta has invested $3.4 billion in a terminal at New York's LaGuardia Airport, consisting of 37 gates.

7,Stocks are moving deeper into a danger zone: Jack Ablin,"Investors should brace for stocks to drop at least 15% in early 2020, money manager Jack Ablin says. MORE IN","A top money manager is on pullback watch as stocks head deeper into record territory. Cresset Capital’s Jack Ablin is telling investors to brace for stocks to drop at least 15% in early 2020. “Valuations are pretty stretched,” the firm’s chief investment officer told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday. “We had [a] 30% move this year on 3% earnings growth.” His newest sell-off call came after the tech-heavy Nasdaq crossed the 9,000 mark for the first time ever, and the S&P 500 rallied to a record high. Ablin suggests the driver for a market setback is unclear. “I can’t see a specific catalyst unless it’s higher interest rates that would precipitate a decline,” he said. Regardless, he has been limiting his exposure to stocks. Ablin, who has $6.7 billion in assets under management, shifted 30% of the firm’s assets to private equity and cash last August because he believed equities were getting too expensive. Since then, he hasn’t been putting new money to work. But he hasn’t been selling stocks either. “From a valuation perspective, it’s hard to see that we’re going to see more P/E expansion without interest rates coming down,” he said. Despite his market warning, Ablin isn’t completely abandoning his bullish views. He plans to use the next pullback as a reset that’ll help him capitalize on future returns. “I hold equities for seven years as a minimum. So, that would be my entry point,” added Ablin. His most bullish 2020 scenario is the market recovering from an early setback with some modest gains. “2020 is probably a payback. We go back to fair value,” Ablin said. “Best case for 2020, mid single digits as the market tends to follow earnings without much valuation expansion.” Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip?

8,American Airlines Stock Rally Could be Short-Lived,American Airlines Stock Rally Could be Short-Lived. Call traders have made big moves on the equity in recent weeks. He,"GET THE BEST OF THE MARKET.
IN JUST 5 MINUTES.
EVERY SATURDAY MORNING.  Now his brand new video reveals the most important tech company in the world. Watch the video here! Sponsored For American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL), 2019 has been a volatile downtrend. Although the equity is up 1.4% at $29.58 this afternoon, it's shed more than 8% over the past 12 months, and now looks to be running into a historically bearish ceiling of resistance at the 160-day moving average. Added pressure from this trendline could quickly burst today's move higher, and send AAL back on a downward spiral to bring in the New Year. According to Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, AAL is trading within one standard deviation of its 160-day moving average, after spending most of its time below this trendline in recent years. Similar tests of this trendline resistance have occurred seven other times over the past three years, resulting in an average 21-day loss of 9.5%, with 86% of the returns negative. Another loss of this severity would send American Airlines stock back below $27 before the end of January.  Despite its unsteady technical performance, call traders have continued to surround the airliner. The equity's 50-day call/put volume ratio of 3.94 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) ranks in the 94th annual percentile, meaning calls have been purchased over puts at a faster-than-usual clip during the past 10 weeks. An unwinding of this bullish sentiment could send the security even lower. Downgrades are also highly likely. Coming into today, eight of 15 brokerage firms sport a ""buy"" or better rating on the airline. Short interest has also jumped 13.9% during the past two reporting periods, and now accounts for a hefty 9.4% of the stock's total available float.

9,Is It Time to Go Long on United Airlines Stock?,Is It Time to Go Long on United Airlines Stock?. What’s hurting United Airlines stock?. Boeing MAX crisis made investors,"UPDATED 12 MONTHS AGO So far, United Airlines (UAL) stock has underperformed the broader markets and its top peers this year. The stock has risen about 6.5% this year. In comparison, the Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq indexes have risen 22.2%, 28.6%, and 34.9%, respectively. United Airlines stock is lagging its peers in terms of growth. Southwest Airlines (LUV), Delta Air Lines, Alaska Air, and JetBlue Airways stocks have risen 18.2%, 19%, 13.5%, and 19.1%, respectively. The stock has also underperformed the iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT), which has 20% exposure in the passenger airline industry. So far, IYT has risen 18.7% this year. A company-specific problem hasn’t hurt United Airlines’ stock price this year. Instead, multiple macroeconomic factors including the government shutdown, trade war worries, slowdown concerns, and attacks on a Saudi oil refinery kept investors highly cautious about the company’s growth prospects. Although geopolitical issues and strained trade relations don’t impact the airline industry directly, they have a long-term effect. A negative macroeconomic environment could trigger a recession in the global economy, which would hurt passenger traffic in the long run. A recessionary situation has a negative impact on the job market, which leads people to cancel or postpone their vacations. Investors are also concerned about the premium valuation. Last year, United Airlines stock was one of the outperformers in the airliner industry. The company registered gains of 24.2%. As a result, United Airlines’ valuation multiples were way higher than its top peers. However, the stock’s underperformance in 2019 made its valuation multiples lower than its peers. Currently, United Airlines trades at a one-year forward PE ratio of 7.4x. Southwest, Delta, JetBlue, and Alaska have forward PE ratios of 12.4x, 8.5x, 10x, and 8.5x, respectively. Investors are also skeptical about United Airlines stock due to the company’s exposure to Boeing’s (BA) 737 MAX aircraft. Notably, MAX aircraft have faced a global flying ban since mid-March following two deadly accidents within five months. United Airlines, which owns 14 MAX planes, is facing thousands of flight cancellations every month due to the grounding. Recently, citing uncertainty about Boeing receiving regulatory approval, the airline extended the grounding period until June 4. Previously, the company stated that MAX flight cancellations wouldn’t have a material impact on its financial results. However, we think that United Airlines’ stance might change when it reports its fourth-quarter results in January.

Many of these funds stand a chance at," The continuation of the trade war between China and the United States, as well as concerns of a yield curve inversion, all led to a dramatic conclusion to 2018 and a questionable start to 2019. As such, many stocks and exchange-traded funds began the year in the red. But despite this rough start, the “doomsome” outlook dissipated and the S&P 500 ultimately gained another 30% on the year. Throughout the year, several InvestorPlace.com writers chose what they thought might be the best ETFs for 2019. And while some of these ETFs ended up being duds (several picks were affected by the trade war), the top 5 picks all gained more than 25% year to date. This year, we have 10 more picks for the contest, some new challengers for the best ETF throne, a returning champion (Vince Martin) and some other familiar faces. But all of the ETFs for 2020 are different from last year’s picks. And the arguments behind some are perhaps far more daring than before. With trade war tensions easing, marijuana stocks losing strength and general market optimism rising, what should we expect in 2020? And might the 2020 election throw a huge wrench into things? Regardless of what happens, each fund in the best ETFs contest this year reflects the core reason why someone might choose an ETF over a single stock investment. Specifically, each fund focuses on a centralized theme that enables access to numerous companies related to that core concept. If you’re a big believer in the future of a big idea, potential catalyst or think you know where the market will go — good or bad — then owning shares of multiple companies related to that market thesis through an ETF can be highly profitable. The best ETFs contest will start with the closing prices of each fund on Dec. 31, 2019, and assess their performance for the year from that day forward. Throughout the year, we will provide quarterly updates on the performance of each fund, until a winner is crowned at the end of 2020.

For the past couple of years, the biggest disagreements in […] Fund managers, economists and investment experts love nothing more than a heated debate. After all, each of them take their approach to investing and building wealth very seriously, and it only makes sense that they strongly believe their own way of doing things is best. For the past couple of years, the biggest disagreements in the world of wealth management have been between those fund managers who prefer an active approach, and those who are opting for the increasingly far more popular and effective passive option (as heralded by Nobel Prize-winning whizz Harry Markowitz). While the active fund managers certain have plenty of passion history behind their arguments, those on the passive investing side are clearly onto something; over a billion dollars has been moved from active stock funds into passive ones in the past decade,  and that kind of economic exodus doesn’t come about for no reason. It’s no coincidence that this rush of interest into passive funds arose with the advent of robo-advisors – an approach fully embraced by passive fund managers for their trustworthiness and unrivalled accuracy. Investment journals and studies since 2007 have repeatedly dealt some pretty major blows to active stock funds, with all kinds of revelations gradually chipping away at the confidence of active stock fund managers. The Wall Street Journal itself has proclaimed that no less than 82% of active funds in the US have seriously trailed behind in the 15 years, and similarly game-changing statistics have flooded out of other countries, too. It seems that the active model has lost some of its sparkle, and is struggling to convince investors of its merits in the 21st century. On the flipside, the passive fund’s star continues to rise year on year, with innovation, accuracy and low-cost fees leading the way. It was the timescale of this Wall Street Journal study that seemed to send real shockwaves through the investment industry. Fifteen years is a long time in the world of investing.

Senior care"," MORE Impacted by myriad factors ranging from high fuel costs to economic slowdown, the Indian aviation sector has recorded operating losses of ₹6,845.78 crore during the first eight months of this financial year, its highest since FY15. For April-November, the private carriers’ losses rose to ₹2,311.79 crore, while that of the national carrier (and subsidiaries) were at ₹4,533.9 crore in the full financial year of FY2019. According to industry experts, things are unlikely to change for the rest of the year. For April-November, state-run carriers posted the highest losses, with Air India’s losses zooming to ₹4,685 crore, as against a loss of ₹1,658 crore recorded in FY2019. Air India’s subsidiary Alliance Air, which generally operates on UDAN routes, posted ₹308 crore in losses (₹134 crore loss in FY19), according to Ministry of Civil Aviation (MOCA) data. Among all the three government-owned carriers, Air India Express is the only profitable one. Even though, there has been a dip in profits, the airline has posted an operating profit of ₹459 crore (₹547 crore). During the reporting eight-month period of FY20, the total operating revenue of Indian carriers stood at ₹81,164 crore (₹92,145 crore). “The Indian aviation industry is hemorrhaging due to several changes in FY20. The growth in passenger demand in the 2019 has been below expectations and the current economic slowdown in India has complicated matters further. The grounding of Boeing 737 MAX, the Pratt & Whitney engine issues faced by IndiGo and the precarious state of Air India are the key obstacles,” Abhilash Varkey Abraham, Research Analyst, Aerospace & Defense, Frost & Sullivan Amongst the private carriers, Tata SIA Airlines (operating as Vistara) posted the highest losses of ₹900 crore during the eight-month period. Even though the full-service carrier recorded operating revenues worth ₹2,994.38 crore, its expenses stood at ₹3,894.85 crore. In the fiscal FY19, the airline had posted losses of ₹516 crore.

After hitting 59 fresh highs, the S&P/TSX Composite Index has climbed about 23% this year, weathering everything investors could throw at the market: volatile commodity prices; the unpredictability of U.S.-China trade tensions; Canada’s fractious federal election; heightened recession fears and persistent profit concerns. Here’s a look at some of the biggest winners and losers in Canada’s equity market this year. Investor Darling Real Matters Inc., a provider of network services for the mortgage and insurance industries, is the biggest gainer so far this year with a 282% surge. The rally has pushed the Markham, Ontario-based company’s market value beyond the $1 billion (US$819 million) mark. Last month, National Bank Financial upgraded the stock to outperform and said it “did not give enough respect to the correlation of Real Matters business with the market volumes for mortgages.” The rotation from value to growth this year has been good for tech stocks, making them the country’s best performing group by a mile. The S&P/TSX Info Tech Index has gained more than 65% this year, adding about $58 billion (US$45 billion) in value. Shopify Inc., the subject of some takeover speculation, is up 183% so far in 2019, the top tech stock and the second-best overall performer on the broader index. Investors have rewarded the Ottawa-based company’s rapid sales growth and its plans to spend US$1 billion to set up a network","Dec 27, 2019",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/real-matters-282-rally-leads-canadian-stocks-this-year-1.1367141

                        Nikkei Asia",Alibaba becomes most valuable Asian company as market cap tops $500bn. READ NEXT. Alibaba's Hong Kong shares soar over 7%,"Samsung and TSMC surged in 2019; Indian automakers and SE Asian airlines slumped SINGAPORE -- Asian tech companies' market caps have grown significantly this year as the tech cycle turned up and investors began pricing in economic recoveries, factors that moved the market capitalization of Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding to well over $500 billion. With recession fears having been dispelled and lower interest rates prevailing globally, analysts say equities will attract more investments next year and that the valuations of Asia's leading tech companies could reach higher. The Nikkei Asian Review compared Asian companies' market caps as of Dec. 20 with where they were at the end of 2018 in dollar terms. New York-listed Alibaba's market value grew to $570 billion in that period, making the company Asia's No. 1 by that measure for the first time since it listed in 2014. Globally, Alibaba had the seventh highest valuation between Facebook ($588 billion) and Berkshire Hathaway ($554 billion). Its market value grew 60%, far above Amazon.com's 20% and Google parent Alphabet's 29%. ""[China's] continually growing real disposable income, with more new cities stepping up the tier-system ladder, has been positively contributing to Alibaba's stock performance,"" said Ivan Platonov, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy EqualOcean. He also said retail -- Alibaba's biggest revenue generator so far -- is not extremely vulnerable to the recent trade tussles, unlike hardware, logistics and other sectors. ""Global investors,"" Platonov said, ""are seemingly buying into this story."" In Alibaba's secondary listing in Hong Kong in November, investors rushed to buy more than $11 billion worth of shares in an offering that was oversubscribed multiple times. Tencent Holdings, Asia's market cap leader for 2018, grew 20% through Dec. 20 but fell to No. 2 due to weaker ad sales, themselves the victim of the rising popularity of social-media upstart ByteDance, which operates TikTok. Tencent also suffered from regulatory headaches in its core gaming business, with Beijing approving fewer titles this year and imposing tougher restrictions on minors' playing hours. A rising star in the Chinese tech sector was Meituan Dianping, a Tencent-backed super app whose market value more than doubled to $76 billion during 2019. A nascent trend toward healthy light meals, beverages and nighttime snacks drove profitability at its core food delivery service. As for tech sector manufacturers, semiconductor producers gained big as the tech cycle bottomed out. Samsung Electronics jumped 39% this year","Dec 26, 2019",https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Alibaba-becomes-most-valuable-Asian-company-as-market-cap-tops-500bn

RECOVERY WITH THE FT FT reporters When 2019 began, risk factors filled the horizon for many of the world’s banks, writes Patrick Jenkins. US-China trade tensions, the rising threat of competition from big technology groups, ultra-low interest rates and the cloud of Brexit all damped expectations for the year ahead. There was little relief on any of those issues. But the year still turned out pretty well for global banks. The Dow Jones US Banks Index rose by a third. And even in Europe, where the environment has steadily worsened, bank sentiment has improved: the Euro Stoxx Banks Index rose 8 per cent. So what will 2020 bring? To an extent, the macroeconomic picture may improve. US president Donald Trump is likely to want to unveil triumphant trade deals, particularly with China, ahead of the US election at the end of the year. Brexit, if not yet “done”, in the words of UK prime minister Boris Johnson, is at least more on track for delivery than under the country’s last more fractured parliament. Given the large new Conservative majority, financiers hope Mr Johnson will be able to negotiate a softer Brexit than would have been the case when the extreme wing of his party was pushing for a “no deal”. That would minimise the disruption to the City of London and also protect the broader European economy. Mr Johnson’s enlarged power base may also have concrete ramifications for the UK’s remaining majority state-owned bank, RBS, which bankers forecast will be a candidate for swift reprivatisation. Aside from the idiosyncratic, there is a general view that two large topics will dominate the agendas of global banks this year: green finance and technology. “The focus on sustainable finance is very much a positive trend,” said Laurie Mayers, associate management director at Moody’s, the rating agency. “European banks are very much committed to doing what they can to help sectors transition.” Huw van Steenis, a senior adviser at UBS, agreed. “Greening the financial system is going to become a top issue for banks in 2020.”  Mr van Steenis, who was previously an adviser to Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor who has made climate change a central topic in the financial risk debate, says lenders will be making a priority of stepping up climate-related risk management and disclosures.

19,How to Beat Pesky Fees | Kiplinger,"Save up to 67%. How to Beat Pesky Fees. No matter how much you try to swat them away, pesky","Getty Images No matter how much you try to swat them away, pesky fees keep nibbling at your travel bookings, wireless plans, bank accounts, investments and pretty much every other part of your financial life. Although the fees may not seem like much on their own, they can add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year, putting a big dent in your wallet. Here, we’ve listed common fees in five categories, plus ways to eliminate or reduce them. Some of the fees are legitimate—professionals such as investment advisers and real estate brokers deserve compensation, after all. But if you’re overpaying for a service, you can make moves to tug down the rate. And with some preparation and knowledge, you can wipe out the most irritating charges. 1 of 14 Getty Images Southwest Airlines doesn’t charge seat-selection fees and lets passengers choose their seats as they board. But the airline assigns your place in line based on when you check in, so the farther back you are, the less likely you’ll get the seat you want. (The EarlyBird boarding fee of $15 to $25 per flight gives you priority.) Check in to your flight online as early as possible to help boost your boarding position. 2 of 14 Getty Images Generally, carry-on bags are free with the biggest U.S. airlines. But note that if you have a basic economy ticket with United, you may be charged a checked-bag fee plus a $25 “gate handling charge” if you bring a full-size carry-on bag to the gate. Discount carriers such as Frontier and Spirit charge for carry-on bags, and the fees are often lowest if you pay them when you book. Plus, you may pay more to take a bag into the cabin than to check it. For a mid-February flight from Atlanta to New York City, for example, Spirit recently charged $33 if you paid for a carry-on bag when reserving your flight but $28 for a checked bag. 3 of 14 Getty Images How to beat them: Resort fees, which some hotels add on to guests’ regular nightly rate for amenities (whether or not you use them), are under fire. Both Marriott International and Hilton are facing lawsuits that, if successful, may cause hotels to ditch the fees or disclose them more prominently, and a bill proposed in the U.S. House of Representatives would require the fees to","Dec 27, 2019",https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/t062-s003-how-to-beat-paying-pesky-fees/index.html
