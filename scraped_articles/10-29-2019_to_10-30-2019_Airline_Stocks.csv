0,Alaska Air Stock Has More Upside After Strong Q3 Earnings | The Motley Fool,Alaska Air Stock Has More Upside After Strong Q3 Earnings. Alaska Air stock may be more expensive than most airline,"   Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) continued its impressive comeback last quarter, reporting another quarter of margin expansion and strong earnings growth. Yet while Alaska Air shares rose 4.1% on Friday, the day after the earnings report, they gave up most of that gain on Monday, after a prominent analyst downgraded the stock on valuation concerns. It's true that Alaska Air stock now trades at a premium to many other airline stocks. However, the stock remains extremely cheap by conventional valuation metrics. Moreover, Alaska Airlines has substantial room to grow earnings per share over the next few years, which could drive Alaska Air stock even higher. Alaska Air's revenue reached $2.39 billion in the third quarter, up 8% compared to the prior-year period. The West Coast-focused airline increased its capacity 3.4% year over year last quarter and also grew revenue per available seat mile (RASM) 4.5%. This RASM increase came in near the high end of the carrier's initial guidance range, as revealed in a guidance update earlier this month. Meanwhile, adjusted nonfuel unit costs rose 3.4%, with about half of that increase driven by one-time ratification bonuses related to new labor contracts. This was a better result than what management had projected three months ago. Finally, Alaska's average fuel price fell to $2.13 per gallon from $2.33 per gallon in Q3 2018. ALASKA AIRLINES' REVENUE GROWTH FAR OUTPACED ITS COST INCREASES LAST QUARTER. IMAGE SOURCE: ALASKA AIRLINES. The net result was that adjusted pre-tax income soared 35% year over year to $421 million. Alaska's adjusted pre-tax margin reached 17.6%, up from 14.1% a year earlier. Adjusted EPS jumped 38% to $2.63, easily beating the average analyst estimate of $2.52. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Alaska Airlines expects its revenue momentum to continue, with RASM rising 1% to 4% year over year. This forecast is particularly impressive because the airline will face much tougher comparisons this quarter than it has year-to-date. RASM rose 5.2% in Q4 2018, compared with a 0.1% decline in last year's third quarter and a 2.3% drop for the first three quarters of 2018 as a whole. Cost trends will also improve this quarter. Alaska expects adjusted nonfuel unit costs to increase less than 1% year over year, while fuel costs are on track to average $2.16 per gallon: down from $2.35 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2018.

1,Volaris' Profit Kept Flying Higher Last Quarter | The Motley Fool,Volaris' Profit Kept Flying Higher Last Quarter. Profitability continues to rebound rapidly from a two-year slump at Mexico's largest domestic,"   Following two years of exceptionally weak results, Volaris (NYSE:VLRS) has bounced back in a big way in 2019. The Mexican budget airline has finally beaten back the competition in some of its core markets, leading to better unit revenue results. Meanwhile, fuel costs remain moderate and Volaris has continued to improve on its industry-leading cost structure. These favorable trends allowed Volaris to achieve stellar earnings in the seasonally strong third quarter. The outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond is solid, too. As a result, while Volaris stock has already doubled since the beginning of the year, this dynamic airline stock still holds more upside for long-term investors.  VOLARIS YEAR-TO-DATE STOCK PERFORMANCE DATA BY YCHARTS. In the first half of 2019, Volaris' operating margin improved by more than 10 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, reaching 4.4%. The company still posted a small net loss, excluding the impact of a gain related to currency fluctuations, but that was far better than its performance a year earlier. By contrast, Volaris earned a big profit in the seasonally stronger third quarter. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) rose 11.4% year over year, driven by rising non-ticket revenue, strong traffic, and higher average fares. Nonfuel unit costs ticked down by 0.3%, thanks to Volaris' efficiency initiatives. Most impressively, Volaris reported a huge improvement in fuel efficiency for the third quarter. The carrier increased its capacity 16.9% year over year last quarter, but it used only 7.2% more fuel than it did a year earlier. The net result is that Volaris increased its operating margin by about 10 percentage points for a third consecutive quarter (from 8.2% to 17.9%). Excluding a foreign exchange loss, Volaris earned about $61 million last quarter, giving it an adjusted pre-tax margin of 12.5%. Earnings per share for Volaris' U.S.-listed shares came in at $0.36, easily beating the average analyst estimate of $0.29. The carrier's profitability also surpassed the very conservative forecast that management had provided in July. Volaris didn't provide specific guidance for the fourth quarter. That said, its full-year outlook implies that its profitability will probably continue to improve, albeit at a slower rate as year-over-year comparisons get tougher. This will allow the carrier to post a solid full-year profit. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX may have helped Volaris on the margins this year, as top competitor Aeromexico was forced to","Oct 30, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/30/volaris-profit-kept-flying-higher-last-quarter.aspx
2,The World of Shareholder Perks and Benefits,The World of Shareholder Perks and Benefits. Some corporations reward their shareholders with unique perks and benefits. Companies With Shareholder,"Shareholder perks often come and go in cycles. To qualify for these perks, an investor usually has to have at least one share of stock in certificate form registered in their own name (rather than held in a brokerage account). As many investors no longer hold the paper stock certificates and the majority of stock trading happens online, many companies have stopped offering perks to their shareholders. Some still do, though, and although shareholder perks should never be the primary motivation for investing in a company, they could sweeten the deal. When you take an ownership position in the stock of a company, you effectively become one of the owners of the business. You get certain rights as a shareholder, such as invitations to shareholder meetings and the ability to vote on issues that affect the direction of the company. You may also receive dividends or special incentives to invest in more shares. Although the type of perks that used to be available have mostly disappeared, a handful of companies still offer certain perks. The investment vehicle of billionaire Warren Buffett offers some of the best shareholder perks in the business world. Investors are treated to discounts at Geico Insurance, as well as significant price reductions during the weekend of the shareholder meeting on merchandise from Borsheims Fine Jewelry & Gifts, See's Candy, and Nebraska Furniture Mart.1 Carnival Corporation openly celebrates its shareholder perks on its website, though you will need to own at least 100 shares to qualify for the benefits. Qualifying shareholders get a free credit of $50 when they sail six days or less in North America, $100 when they sail seven to 13 days, and $250 when they sail 14 days or longer. Perks are similar for European, UK, and Australian cruises, though the currency type and exact amounts vary.2 Through a dedicated, controlled-access website, registered shareholders of IHG can book hotel stays for discounted prices (subject to availability).3﻿ IHG owns brands like Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Candlewood Suites, Intercontinental Hotels & Resorts, Hotel Indigo, and Staybridge Suites. Investors who own 100 or more shares of its common stock can save 50% on regular one-way airfare for any domestic flight. The number of coupons you receive increases as your share count rises. For example, if you own 900 shares, you get five coupons for 50% off.

3,5 Iconic Airlines That No Longer Exist,5 Iconic Airlines That No Longer Exist. . KEY TAKEAWAYS. Pan American World Airways. . Trans World Airlines. Eastern Airlines,"Several airlines that were once very popular with air travelers have disappeared from the landscape of operational air carriers. Financial problems have been the demise of many major airlines, while labor problems, increased competition, and plane crashes doomed others. Pan American World Airways was once one of the most recognized airlines in the world. Pan Am was a founding member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the main international air carrier in the United States for more than half a century, from 1930 to 1990. Pan Am was considered one of the most luxurious airlines to fly during the 1950s and 1960s. The airline's fortunes started declining in the 1970s when deregulation led to increased competition from other carriers, accompanied by a marked increase in fuel prices and declining international travel. Whether Pan Am could have weathered the financial storm will never be known; the airline was permanently grounded by the infamous 1988 Lockerbie crash of Pan Am Flight 103, the result of a terrorist bombing that killed 259 passengers and crew and 11 members of the ground crew. The airline struggled along for three more years, mostly by selling off assets, but it was financially defunct by the end of 1991. Despite the closure of Pan Am airline, the brand lives on in pop culture and fashion—ABC aired Pan Am, a fictionalized drama featuring the airline, in 2011 and a pop-up bar featuring the brand was open in downtown Cincinnati in October 2019. Pan Am's major U.S. competitor in international flights, Trans World Airlines, or TWA, has not survived either. Originally founded in 1925 as a different airline company with the same initials—Transcontinental and Western Air—TWA became a major international air carrier after its acquisition by billionaire Howard Hughes in 1939. TWA was, like Pan Am, known as a luxury carrier and considered to be at the cutting edge of technological innovation in air travel. However, the airline had difficulty borrowing money with Hughes at the head of the company, and it nearly went bankrupt in the early 1960s. TWA seemed to recover after Hughes relinquished control, but it was then hit by the deregulation and fuel cost crises of the 1970s. Additionally, the company's management attempted to diversify by acquiring Hilton International and Century 21 properties. During the 1980s, TWA experienced increasing financial problems that eventually resulted in the airline declaring bankruptcy in 1992 and then","Oct 30, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102115/5-iconic-airlines-no-longer-exist.asp

All the above-mentioned carriers delivered better-than-expected earnings per share, which also increased year over year, aided by low fuel costs. However, the revenue picture was not all that rosy with American Airlines and Southwest Airlines lagging estimates. Moreover, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, which have 24 and 34 Boeing 737 MAX jets in their respective fleets, issued not too impressive non-fuel unit cost views for the December quarter. Moreover, American Airlines anticipates its full-year 2019 pre-tax income to be hurt by roughly $540 million due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jets.

Meanwhile, total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) inched up 2% to 15.71 cents in the reported quarter.

Southwest expects non-fuel unit costs for the December quarter to increase year over year in the 4-6% range, primarily due to lower capacity from the MAX groundings.

Airline industry stocks, like the market, look"," Earnings season is working out reasonably well for U.S. stocks so far. The S&P 500 set an all-time closing high on Friday, and then posted a 0.56% gain on Monday.  Of course, there’s still work left to do. Key earnings reports from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) loom. But the fear in the last couple of weeks has been that history would repeat. Stocks plunged at the beginning of last year’s fourth quarter and fell sharply during the heart of last quarter’s earning season. So far, investors have shrugged off those fears. And there’s some logic to the gains. The U.S. economy, and the U.S. consumer, both remain strong. External risks like the trade war and Brexit persist. But they should be resolved at some point, leaving potential catalysts for more upside in the not-too-distant future. Of course, this also is the eleventh year of both a bull market and an American economic recovery. A downturn on both fronts, too, should arrive at some point. Valuations have recovered since last year’s sell-off, with cyclical stocks in particular posting huge gains in 2019. This week’s three big stock charts focus on a sector that highlights the potential risks and rewards of the broader market: the airline industry. Stocks in the space, like the market as a whole, seem cheap enough that the rally can continue. But external pressures create risks both near-term and long-term — just like the rest of the market. 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021  Boeing (NYSE:BA) quite obviously has risks beyond those facing the rest of the market. The pair of 737 MAX 8 tragedies have weighed on BA stock since March. That said, the first of our three big stock charts still highlights broader market questions.

In fact, Southwest was the world’s largest operator of the 737 MAX 8. The grounding has created significant costs, including some $210 million in the third quarter alone. Those costs will continue for several more months: the company already has pulled the plane from its schedule through February.

7,6 Stocks to Buy for Their Massive Stock Buybacks | Kiplinger,Save up to 67%. 6 Stocks to Buy for Their Massive Stock Buybacks. Stock buybacks are big business.. Data is,"Getty Images Stock buybacks are big business. In the second quarter of 2019 alone, S&P 500 companies spent almost $165 billion on share repurchases – and that was 26% less than the record high spent in Q4 2018. But it's still a big number. ""While the decline is significant compared to 2018, it remains higher than the pre-2018 levels,"" writes Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Buybacks yield several benefits. Among them, given the simple math of calculating earnings per share (EPS) – total earnings divided by total shares outstanding – buying back shares can ""juice"" the EPS figure. Moreover, they tilt supply and demand in shareholders' favor. If a company takes shares off the market, in theory, it should make the remaining ones worth more. But are stock buybacks a reason to buy? Not on their own. But they are one of several material signs – dividend programs, manageable or no debt, intelligent capital expenditures – that a company is putting its stock in a position to succeed. Here are six stocks to buy that have spent considerably on stock buybacks over the past few years. Importantly, all six stock picks sport additional fundamentals that should help them make the most of a tailwind as they continue to reduce their share counts. 1 of 6 Getty Images Payments processor Visa (V, $177.63) would be a fine and welcome addition to most portfolios on its fundamentals alone. The world's largest payment processor – Visa boasts 3.3 billion cards in use across more than 200 countries – has grown its revenues at a compound average annual rate of nearly 10% over the past half-decade. Better still, its earnings per share have grown by roughly 20% annually over the same time frame. Stock buybacks have lifted that number; Visa has spent $31.9 billion on repurchases over the past five years (not including the most recently reported Q3, in which Visa bought back another $2.7 billion in shares). But its actual profits still have advanced by a little more than 17% annually. It's the perfect combination of share repurchases augmenting solid operations. Visa bought back 20% of its shares over the past five years, and remains committed to share repurchases. At the start of the year, Visa announced an $8 billion buyback plan. It's also a relentless dividend grower.

Is United Airlines Holdings still cheap?. Can we expect","Let's talk about the popular United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine United Airlines Holdings’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings Good news, investors! United Airlines Holdings is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $117.37, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that United Airlines Holdings’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 13% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for United Airlines Holdings. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? Since UAL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UAL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock.

CNBC Newsletters","Ralph Lauren and Lululemon could be the best of a beaten-down retail breed. TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon says the two stocks are on his radar for possible breakouts. He says Ralph Lauren’s near 3% dividend yield and 12 times forward multiple make it particularly attractive. “We are holding uptrend support here. This is an interesting value area,” Gordon said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Monday. “Right at about the $90-$95 region here, we have a test.”  Ralph Lauren finished Monday’s session at $97.72 per share. It is down over 5% for the year, underperforming the XRT, the ETF that tracks retailers, which is up over 9%. However, Gordon thinks the stock might be due for a breakout. “If we can hold some support here right around $90 [and] we have a little bit of relief from the Chinese deal — they source a lot of their inputs from China — we could get a little bit of a pop potentially into November 7th earnings,” Gordon said.  Retail stocks were in focus Monday after Tiffany reported it was reviewing a $14.5 billion takeover offer from LVMH. The XRT was up around 1% in Monday’s session. Gordon says there’s another name he’s checking out in the bunch. “There’s another one that I really like in terms of luxury kind of athletic apparel — Lululemon. I’ve held this stock since the $140s. I continue to like it. We don’t have earnings until December 5th, but what an amazing, amazing uptrend,” he said.  Lululemon has surged nearly 70% this year, so Gordon is warning the stock is getting a bit pricey at current levels. It closed Monday’s session at $205.97 per share. “You’re going to start to see a little bit of divergence as we start to hesitate as we push through $200. So, I have my finger on the ejection button here. I love the trend, but if we’re to break down through uptrend support, I might kind of bail and take some profits in those positions, but watch that one while we’re above support we could continue to go higher, we’ll see.

12,Stocks to Buy and Avoid in November,"Stocks to Buy and Avoid in November. ALK could fly high next month, while DRE stock could slip after earnings.","  Widely recognized investor predicted the top tech stock on the S&P 500
In the last three of four years... See his next prediction here! Sponsored The S&P 500 Index (SPX) has had a banner October, pacing for a 2.1% monthly gain and fresh off an all-time high. Looking ahead to November, several stocks could extend the positive momentum, if history is any indicator, including travel concern Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK). On the flip side, red-hot real estate investment trust (REIT) stock Duke Realty Corp (NYSE:DRE) could be facing seasonal headwinds ahead of earnings. Below are the 25 best SPX stocks to own in November, looking back 10 years. Alaska Air stock easily tops the list, ending the month higher 100% of the time, and averaging a one-month gain of 10%, per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White.  ALK shares have been on fire since skimming the $57 in late August, and marked a year-to-date high of $72 last Friday, Oct. 25, following well-received earnings and guidance. What's more, the stock has surged more than 30% since touching a four-year low of $53.39 in late March, breaking out to the upside recently after an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. From the security's current perch of $69.61, another 10% surge next month would put it around $76.57 -- north of its late 2018 highs.  A continued short squeeze could help keep the wind at ALK's back. Short interest has been dropping recently, but still accounts for nearly a week's worth of pent-up buying demand, at the airline stock's average pace of trading. Plus, in light of the equity's post-earnings volatility crush, near-term options are attractively priced. The stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 24% sits in just the 11th percentile of its annual range, meaning now is an opportune time to speculate on ALK's short-term trajectory with options. Duke Realty tops the list of the worst stocks to own in November, looking back 10 years at current S&P 500 components. The equity has ended the month higher just 20% of the time -- the worst of the group -- and has averaged a loss of roughly 3.2%.  DRE shares are on pace for their fifth straight gain today, and their eighth gain in nine sessions.

13,Flying High: The Real Factors That Affect the Cost of Your Flight - AirHelp,. . . . Flying High: The Real Factors That Affect the Cost of Your Flight. Ask the experts. The,"Delayed or Cancelled Flight?
You have a right to compensation whatever your ticket price. BY LORNE ST. CLAIR | LAST UPDATED ON OCTOBER 30, 2019 For global travellers, the constantly shifting price of airline tickets is one of the hottest topics of the travel experience. Whatever your tactic is – booking at noon on Tuesdays, during a thunderstorm, or clearing your internet cookies before you search – the factors that affect airfares has long been the source of myths and misconceptions. Out of all these, there’s one theory we’ve spotted on social media that surprised us the most. It’s come up a few times, so we want to puncture the myth once and for all and offer up a little bit of industry expertise to set the record straight. Here goes: companies like AirHelp force airlines to hike up ticket prices due to EC 261 compensation claims. A small number of people feel that airlines are losing money because they pay back passengers for flight delays and cancellations and pay flight cancellation compensation, and this is reflected in an increase in ticket prices. We can see the misunderstanding. It’s not your imagination that airline tickets have risen in recent years, and there are a number of reasons. However, it is a massive misconception that EC261 claims have an impact on airline profits or ticket prices. Here’s why… Independent transport consultancy firm Steer Davies Gleaves was hired to conduct a study on the impact that passenger legislation had on the airline’s finances and the industry as a whole. They found that even if 100% of passengers were paid out for claims under EC 261, it would only result in an increase of less than €1 per ticket. Here’s our Chief Information Officer Ashley Raiteri with some industry insights: The price of tickets is in no way affected by EC 261 claims, and less than 8% of the total liability owed by airlines is ever paid. The cost that comes with delays and cancellations – crew overtime, airport fees, passenger re-routing, fuel etc – is thousands of times more than the total compensation payouts under EC261. Since 2013, AirHelp has helped over two million passengers globally to get flight compensation for delayed, cancelled and overbooked flights. The average compensation payout is around €650 per claim.

How Creativity Became Essential To Getting Out The Youth Vote In,"NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 28:  Sir Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Galactic, gives the thumbs up ... [+]  This week, Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company launched by billionaire Sir Richard Branson in 2004, made its first appearance on stock markets. Virgin Galactic Holdings began trading on Monday, October 28 on the NYSE as SPCE. (Branson also had another, less-publicized triumph this week when his Virgin Trains was approved to sell $3.25 billion in bonds to create a Las Vegas-California high speed train line.) Over 9 million shares changed hands on October 28. The stock, which hit a high of 12.93 on its launch date, has since fallen back to earth somewhat, closing on October 30 at 10.61.

These tourist jaunts are based on a reusable vehicle being launched from a mothership and zooming up to 300,000 feet. Virgin Galactic says there is a path to profit, from such space tourists flights according to a presentation to the Securities and Exchange Commission reviewed by Space.com. Projections included a $104 million loss in 2020 while Virgin Galactic launches its space tourism program, near break-even operations by 2021 and a projected $274 million in earnings by 2023.
