0,Robinhood Investors Are Betting on a Travel Stock Recovery -- Should You? | The Motley Fool,Robinhood Investors Are Betting on a Travel Stock Recovery -- Should You?. Some investors expect great share gains to eventually,"   Airline and cruise stocks are among the most sought after these days among investors trading on Robinhood. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and Carnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL) are among the 10 most popular stocks on the online trading platform. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the shares have dropped 60%, 56%, and 71%, respectively, since the start of the year. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Do these declines mean you should follow Robinhood investors into travels stocks and bet on a rebound? Keep in mind that many Robinhood users are new investors who often favor stocks they hope will deliver quick gains and/or ones that may rebound from deep losses. Let's take a closer look at the companies and the coronavirus situation. The coronavirus outbreak began in China earlier in the year and has since spread throughout the world. Countries ordered lockdowns or issued stay-at-home recommendations this spring, and travel nearly came to a standstill in many regions. Travel shares felt the impact in the most recent quarter. Delta reported an 88% decline in operating revenue after an 85% drop in capacity. Delta posted a $5.7 billion loss on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. Carnival Cruises paused cruises in mid-March, and sailings haven't yet resumed. The company posted a $4.4 billion loss on a GAAP basis. And American Airlines reported a $2.7 billion pre-tax loss for the second quarter and predicted third-quarter capacity will be down 60% year over year. A comment from Delta's CEO Ed Bastian indicates troubles are far from over. He called the coronavirus impact on the airline's operations ""truly staggering"" and said he doesn't expect to see a sustainable recovery until more than two years from now. We also can look to the current coronavirus situation in the U.S. and beyond as a guide. The U.S. has surpassed 150,000 deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University. Cases worldwide have reached more than 16.5 million, while global deaths total more than 656,000, the World Health Organization reports. States including Florida, California, and Texas continue to see cases mount. Only some states have ordered the wearing of masks in public in efforts to halt the spread of the coronavirus. All of this means the health crisis is still going strong -- and we don't have a clear idea of when it will abate. Meanwhile, the U.S. hasn't","Aug 1, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/01/robinhood-investors-are-betting-on-a-travel-stock.aspx
1,SAVE Stock Is the Best Bargain in the Airline Industry | InvestorPlace,"Spirit Airlines Is the Best Bargain in the Airline Industry. SAVE stock has been outperforming its peers, while its balance"," Just like flying, Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) is the best bargain when it comes to airline stocks. And did you know, SAVE stock has been one of the best performers over the past few months?   Over the past one and three months, Spirit stock is down 11% and up 20%, respectively. That’s better than a handful of its peers, including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).  However, when we zoom out to the year-to-date and one-year timeframes, that outperformance vanishes. Down 61% in 2020, SAVE stock is in the middle of the pack — third best in this group of five. The one-year look yields a similar result, down 62% and again in the middle of the pack.  So why is this one worth a closer look? Simply because the airlines have made it through the worst quarter they are likely to face. Airport traffic is creeping back up as the country continues to reopen. Let’s look at Spirit Airlines more closely.  When Spirit Airlines reported earnings on July 22, the company beat on revenue but missed on earnings. Put simply, the quarter wasn’t good. Spirit reported a loss of $3.59 per share as revenue plunged more than 86%. Remember though, it’s not about the numbers, it’s about the trajectory. Meaning, it’s about guidance, management’s outlook and where the business is heading from here. In the case of SAVE stock, obviously a massive loss and tremendous drop in revenue does not exactly scream, “Buy! Buy! Buy!” However, investors are feeling more comfortable with airline stocks now that Q2 is behind them. While management is candid about the situation — Delta said it will take a few years for a sustainable recovery — they also underscored two important themes.  First, liquidity is satisfactory as most of these companies should have enough in the bank to make it through the current crisis. Second, the worst is likely behind the industry. For Spirit specifically, this is encouraging for shareholders: “[W]e were encouraged by our June results and believe they illustrate that when leisure travel demand rebounds and stabilizes, our leading low-cost structure positions us well to be among the first to return to profitability.” Most airlines saw severe cash burn in March and April, but were able to lower that burden in May and June. Spirit did even better.","Jul 31, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/07/spirit-airlines-save-stock-best-bargain-airline-industry/
2,"With More Debt Than It Can Handle, Avoid AAL Stock | InvestorPlace","With More Debt Than It Can Handle, Avoid American Airlines Stock. Lagging behind the pack, AAL has its work cut"," What in store for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) post-pandemic? Sure, a rapid comeback in AAL stock is possible. But, compared to other airline plays, it faces a tougher road ahead.  How so? Firstly, one could argue that low-cost carriers like Southwest (NYSE:LUV) are better airline recovery plays. Secondly, the airline faces more hurdles than even its rival legacy peers. Deemed an “sector laggard” by JPMorgan’s Jamie Baker, Delta (NYSE:DAL) and United (NASDAQ:UAL) have a much better shot at recovery. And this on top of the overarching issues still plaguing the sector. Back in early June, speculators may have been betting on a swift novel coronavirus recovery. But, as the pandemic still lingers across the U.S., it’s clear things aren’t going “back to normal” this year. Investors have gotten the message, sending AAL stock closer to prior lows. Yet, things may not be bottoming out just yet. There could be additional stimulus around the corner for airlines. But, that may not be enough to shore things up. Granted, American isn’t doomed for bankruptcy. However, as bad times linger, it’s hard to see shares heading higher from today’s prices (around $11.30 per share). Overall, the analyst community remains mixed on airline stocks. But for American in particular, analyst sentiment is mostly bearish. Analysts like Citigroup’s Stephen Trent and Raymond James’ Savanthi Syth have both rated shares the equivalent of “sell.” UBS’s Myles Walton is also bearish on American. Namely, due to how there’s “no more room to go on costs.” And, if cost-cutting has been maxed out, it’s hard to see how this struggling carrier gets through what could last several years. June’s expectations of an airline recovery before year’s end seem like a distant memory. The new consensus is that air travel won’t “return to normal” until at least a vaccine becomes widely available. In other words, things may not improve much in the near-term from where they are today. Sure, the airline’s situation has improved from where it was back in the spring. As InvestorPlace’s Todd Shriber wrote Jul 27, cash burn for American has come down from $100 million per day in April to just $30 million per day in June.

5,Will Warren Buffett Buy Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Will Warren Buffett Buy Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock?. Learn the background. Will,"      Ryan Vanzo | August 1, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock looks like a great value opportunity. From 2012 to 2019, shares rose 50 times in value. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic sent shares lower by nearly 70%. Many investors are betting that a rebound is just around the corner. If they’re right, they could triple their investment. Last year, Warren Buffett was a leading investor of four different airlines. He’s also known for buying distressed businesses during a market panic. During the financial crisis of 2008, for example, he took big positions in many well-known companies. With a high-quality business model and a proven record of success, it’s reasonable to believe that the Oracle of Omaha will make a bet on Air Canada stock. In many ways, it’s a perfect fit. Will Warren Buffett buy Air Canada stock? Before you decide whether Buffett will jump in, it’s important to understand how he thinks about airlines. In a nutshell, he wasn’t always a fan. But over time, he learned to love these businesses. “If a far-sighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting Orville down,” Buffett said more than a decade ago. “I think there have been almost 100 airline bankruptcies,” he later added. “I mean, that is a lot. It’s been a disaster for capital.” By 2017, however, Buffett bought shares in several airlines. While he didn’t take a position in Air Canada, his investing actions clearly indicated what type of airline he preferred. “It’s true that the airlines had a bad twentieth century,” Buffett noted a few years before the pandemic began. “They’re like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way. The hope is they will keep orders in reasonable relationship to potential demand.” The biggest thing that changed was competition. Industry supply used to be so rampant that no airline could turn a profit, including Air Canada. Then competition rationalized. Supply and demand were balanced, meaning pricing recovered. All of this was due to consolidation. Buffett’s airline positions were completely focused on businesses with high market shares, which give them disproportionate pricing power. If you want to know which airlines Buffett will buy, look at the market share leaders. It’s critical to note that Buffett no longer owns any airline","Aug 1, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/01/will-warren-buffett-buy-air-canada-tsxac-stock/

comments  When it comes to the travel industry, it feels like everything's a gamble – from booking a holiday in what might be the next quarantine hotspot to investing in an airline that may or may not go bankrupt at any moment. If you're willing to take a chance on booking a two-week break in Alicante, though, you might also have the risk appetite for a travel stock or two.  Warren Buffett famously said that we should be 'fearful when others are greedy, and greedy only when others are fearful' – and, after all, many have rarely felt so fearful about a summer break. Risky business: But if you're willing to take a chance on booking a two-week break in Alicante, you might also have the risk appetite for a travel stock or two For the travel industry, the coronavirus pandemic has been a tale of one disaster after another, with little to mitigate the pain. First came reports of coronavirus on cruise ships, ensuring that this particular form of vacation came to be viewed as little more than a floating petri dish. Then came total lockdown, meaning that no one could go anywhere on holiday at all. Now, just as green shoots start to appear and families begin to wonder about a summer break, comes the abrupt quarantine requirement slapped on those taking a trip to Spain amid fears of a second Covid wave, raising concern that the same could happen again to anyone who books a holiday anywhere at all. Jason Hollands, managing director of fund broker and adviser Tilney Bestinvest, says: 'The travel sector has been right at the sharp end of the Covid-19 crisis and continues to face considerable headwinds.' Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor, agrees, pointing out that two big players were ejected from the FTSE 100 in June as their share prices collapsed when all about them recovered. Carnival and easyJet were the two to lose their FTSE 100 crown. The cruise operator lost £3.5billion between March and May this year, after it suspended sailings following severe outbreaks on some of its ships. It is now planning to sell six of its vessels, although it hopes to resume in a very small way in late","Aug 1, 2020",https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-8583687/Travel-stocks-face-new-virus-peril-snap-cheap-survivor-jaws-disaster.html

The second quarter was the most turbulent in history for the legacy carrier. Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com Year over year, revenue fell to $1.62 billion, an 86.5% drop. From passenger revenue to the cargo business, there were no positive headlines that emanated from the earnings report. However, that isn’t surprising. Everyone knows that the novel coronavirus pandemic severely dented the U.S. economy. Airlines, cruises and any other sector that require social gathering are firmly in the dumps. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But if you focus on AAL in particular, you will find that the airline is in much more trouble than any of its peers. Unfortunately, that has more to do with the company’s response to the crisis rather than the prevailing situation. 10 Gaming Stocks That Will Power Through the New Normal In a puzzling strategy, when most airlines have decided to streamline operations and cut spending, American Airlines chose to go down a different route. It seems it’s trying to already lay the groundwork for an eventual Chapter 11 filing, through pacifying all stakeholders, except shareholders. Taking into account the enormous debt load and the improbability of positive free cash flow for the next few years, I would say it’s time to part ways with AAL stock. The biggest controversy surrounding airlines for a while has been their penchant for repurchasing stock to boost stock value. According to a Bloomberg article, American Airlines bought back over $12.5 billion of stock despite having negative cumulative free cash flow. So, you can understand that the issues with American and some of its peers are not new, nor can they be totally blamed on Covid-19. At a time when the company should have been using its resources to increase earnings, AAL chose to focus on share repurchases.

erkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) is a multinational conglomerate holding corporation with investments in a variety of sectors, including positions in such major brands as Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and American Express (NYSE: AXP). Based in Omaha, Nebraska, the company has been guided by Warren Buffett’s management philosophy since 1962, before which it was a textile manufacturing firm.  This article was originally published on MyWallSt — Investing for Everyone. Over the six decades that Buffett has been at the helm, it has grown to employ nearly four hundred thousand people and grossed $81.4 billion in 2019. As it proudly displays on the opening page of its annual reports, investing with Berkshire represented a 2,744,062% gain in the period of 1964-2019, compared with 19,784% with the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: VOO). So far so good; but all things must come to an end, and many commentators have pointed to Buffett’s advanced age as a reason to doubt the future of Berkshire Hathaway. So, is now the time to invest in Berkshire Hathaway?   The bull case for Berkshire Hathaway Here are some salient points that make Berkshire Hathaway a safe bet:   The bear case for Berkshire Hathaway It is true, though, that these are unprecedented times and it seemed uncharacteristic of Buffett when he decided to dump all airline stocks — which included positions in the ‘big 4’, United (NYSE: UAL), American (NYSE: AAL), Southwest (NASDAQ: LUV), and Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL). This move made shockwaves precisely because Buffett is seen as such a stable, reliable character and he previously had gone on record as saying he wouldn’t sell off his airline stocks.  Likewise, the fact that Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on its vast cash reserves is causing many to question whether they lack the dynamism of less risk-averse investors. Berkshire bought $10 billion in natural gas infrastructure assets from Dominion Energy (NYSE: D), but this represents less than 10% of its total cash reserves, leading some to say Warren Buffett has lost his touch, and hence the company has lost its direction. Again, this tends to come back to the fact that Buffett himself is 89 years old.     So, should I buy Berkshire Hathaway stock? These caveats notwithstanding, my money is still on Berkshire.

As airlines sell fewer tickets, owing to pandemic travel restrictions or travellers’ fear of infection, the industry that makes flying possible faces a reckoning.

 ON JULY 31, 2020 Big tech continues to lead Q2 earnings, with a surprise winner from Canada; the market price of gold surpasses its old record; what Warren Buffett is selling (and buying) these days; and more.  Photo by Yaroslav Verstiuk on Unsplash Each week, Cut the Crap Investing founder Dale Roberts shares financial headlines and offers context for Canadian investors. ADVERTISEMENT  Gold stole the headlines this week. That can happen when an infamous asset takes out its previous all-time highs.  Last Sunday, gold made another push and hit its all-time high above $1,920. By Friday, July 31, the price had moved above $1,990. (Gold is priced in USD.)  Gold is gaining based on general uncertainties in these, well, uncertain times. There is also the fear of inflation. Many investors also point to the prolific money printing from central banks and the ballooning deficits and deficits. In this MoneySense post, I touched on Canada’s pending $1-trillion debt, and the similarly large number representing proposed stimulus in the U.S.  MoneySense contributor Bryan Borzykowski recently pondered whether it’s time to buy gold again:  “A lot of people are excited about gold today because of how much debt countries around the world are accumulating. The more leverage these countries take on, the more concern there is about currency devaluation, while gold remains worth what it’s worth.”  Portfolio managers who are fans of gold will suggest a 5% to 10% portfolio weighting. As Bryan suggested in his article, if gold gains are modest, that kind of allocation won’t give you much of an overall bump.  That said, we might remember that gold increased almost tenfold during the period of stagflation of the 1970s and early 80s. During the Great Depression, the price of gold more than doubled in value in the early years of the stock market crash from 1929. In modern times, from 2000 and  moving through the dot-com bust, the financial crisis and the recent pandemic crisis, gold has been one of the best performing assets. (A good source for gold performance charts is macrotrends.com.) Detractors of gold will, of course, point to the long periods (decades) when gold has lost value.

United Airlines director sells US$5.25M in holdings as travel plummets,"  MORE  Latest Videos  Most Popular Content Jul 31, 2020  Bruce Einhorn, Bloomberg News United Airlines Holdings planes. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg , Bloomberg   A director of United Airlines Holdings Inc. liquidated all of his directly owned shares in the company as the carrier struggles with a devastating decline in travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic. United is considering furloughs for as many as one-third of its nearly 12,000 pilots, an executive warned on July 30. On July 28, Edward Shapiro sold more than 157,000 shares for US$5.25 million, four days after selling 25,000 shares, according to filings with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission. United’s shares have plummeted 64 per cent this year. Shapiro, chairman of Lumexis Corp., joined United’s board in 2016. He sits on the board’s compensation, finance and public responsibility committees, and last year received about US$369,000 in compensation from United, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The sale of his shares comes at a time when the U.S. is missing out on a rebound in air traffic taking place in many other countries. China and other parts of Asia enjoyed “strong growth” in departures between July 22 and 28, according to BloombergNEF. Northern Europe, southern Europe and other parts of the world had strong growth, too. One exception was the U.S., where the surge in new COVID-19 cases in states such as Florida and Texas led to a decline in departures. U.S. airports had 70 fewer flights take off compared with the previous week, BNEF said. United had planned on cutting 2,250 pilots this year, but senior vice president of flight operations Bryan Quigley said in a memo to pilots that the company now expects to furlough 3,900. “And that may not prove to be enough,” he wrote.

United is considering furloughs for as many as one-third of its nearly 12,000 pilots, an executive warned on July 30. On July 28, Edward Shapiro sold more than 157,000 shares for $5.25m, four days after selling 25,000 shares, according to filings with the US Securities & Exchange Commission. United’s shares have plummeted 64% in 2020. United declined to comment. Shapiro, chair of Lumexis., joined United’s board in 2016. He sits on the board’s compensation, finance and public responsibility committees and in 2019 received about $369,000 in compensation from United, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The sale of his shares comes as the US is missing out on a rebound in air traffic in many other countries. China and other parts of Asia enjoyed “strong growth” in departures between July 22 and 28, according to BloombergNEF.
