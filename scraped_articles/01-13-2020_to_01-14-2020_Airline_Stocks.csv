0,Can Delta Air Lines Stock Keep Soaring in 2020? | The Motley Fool,Can Delta Air Lines Stock Keep Soaring in 2020?. How Delta's Q4 2019 earnings could be the cherry on top,"   In the past, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) had a poor reputation as a slow and stodgy legacy airline. The darkest hour came in 2005, when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Since emerging as an independent company in 2007, Delta has rebranded and restructured a culture of excellence, achieving a reputation that has now earned it ""industry-leading reliability and record customer satisfaction."" Delta will hope to wrap up a solid 2019 when it reports Q4 earnings on Jan. 14. Here's what investors need to know about Delta and expect from its earnings report.  DAL DATA BY YCHARTS The past decade was nothing less than revolutionary in terms of investor sentiment toward airline stocks. All six major airline stocks ascended over 200% in the 2010s, beating the S&P 500 during one of the best bull markets in history. In years past, even top investors like Warren Buffett criticized the cyclical nature and capital intensity of airlines. That changed in 2016 when Berkshire Hathaway purchased shares of four major airlines, one of which was Delta. Buffett then added more than 5 million shares in 2019. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Delta reported Q3 2019 basic earnings per share (EPS) of $2.32 -- a 29% increase year over year (YOY). With the economy booming and the summer travel season in full swing, third-quarter earnings are typically one of the best for airline stocks. For Delta, it was outstanding. CEO Edward H. Bastian noted, ""[W]e had [a] record summer in terms of both volumes and revenues, so all-time high revenues for us."" Most of the growth for air travel is from emerging markets, but Delta was able to increase domestic revenues by 8% in the third quarter of 2019. Basic earnings per share for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019 stand at $5.61 versus $4.20 from the same period in 2018, a 33% increase. Delta is forecasting Q3 2019 EPS of $1.20 to $1.50, wrapping up 2019 guidance of $6.75 to $7.25 and a 2020 outlook of $6.75 to $7.75. Although 2020 isn't expected to have the same YOY growth as 2018 to 2019, Delta's earnings, compared to the price, make it a powerhouse value stock.  DAL DATA BY YCHARTS Between May 2019 and July 2019, Delta increased its quarterly dividend by 15%, fueling a decade that ended with a 570% increase to its dividend.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Delta Air Lines DAL illustrated an impressive beat on both top and bottom-lines, propelling the share price up over 4% in morning trading. DAL’s reported EPS surpassed analysts’ estimates by more than 20%, representing a year-over-year appreciation of 31% and its largest EPS beat in almost 6 years. The firm also rose its 2020 Q1 guidance. I expect that this stock will move from its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) to a #1 (Strong Buy) once analysts have adjusted their models for the positive earnings. Delta kicked off earnings season for the airlines on an optimistic note, but was the firm’s positive earnings and outlook a product of inherent advantages, or were there industry-wide implications? The answer is a combination of the two. In Delta’s press release this morning, it associated its significant EPS beat with stronger than anticipated revenue, lower fuel costs, and a 9 cent gain related to its unwinding partnership with GOL. Lower fuel costs and some of the increased revenue can be associated with an industry-wide positive. More passengers and lower costs per passenger. Top US Airline stocks including United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL, and Southwest LUV are up over 1% in trading this morning. 737 MAX The critica difference between Delta and its biggest competitor is that Delta doesn’t fly the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. This is a significant advantage considering that this grounding is negatively impacting the capacity of all the other major airlines. Delta’s increase in revenues is partially a product of Delta taking advantage of the other airlines’ loss in capacity from the 737 MAX grounding. Southwest is the most exposed with 34 737 MAXs and 310 orders, followed by American who has 24 737 MAXs and 100 orders. The full Q4 impact of this plane’s grounding on the other airlines will show in their reports and earnings calls in the coming weeks.

8,American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Investors Should Think About This Before Buying It For Its Dividend - Simply Wall St News,American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Investors Should Think About This Before Buying It For Its Dividend. Payout ratios. Is American,"Today we'll take a closer look at American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) from a dividend investor's perspective. Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations. Investors might not know much about American Airlines Group's dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last five years and offers a 1.5% yield. A low yield is generally a turn-off, but if the prospects for earnings growth were strong, investors might be pleasantly surprised by the long-term results. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 6.9% of market capitalisation this year. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying American Airlines Group for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis Dividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. American Airlines Group paid out 11% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. We like this low payout ratio, because it implies the dividend is well covered and leaves ample opportunity for reinvestment. Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Last year, American Airlines Group paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable. As American Airlines Group has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 3.20 times its EBITDA, investors are starting to","Jan 13, 2020",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group/news/american-airlines-group-inc-nasdaqaal-investors-should-think-about-this-before-buying-it-for-its-dividend

SHARE THIS POST. Delta Air Lines,"   REUTERS/Lucas Jackson  Delta Air Lines reported fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday morning that beat analysts' highest profit estimate, according to Bloomberg data. The company also topped expectations for quarterly revenue and posted a 2.4% gain for revenue per available seat mile, a key metric for airline efficiency. Delta shares traded as much as 4.5% higher in early Tuesday trading, hitting their highest levels since July.  Here are the key numbers: Revenue: $11.44 billion, versus $11.34 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $1.70, versus the $1.40 consensus estimate and $1.52 highest estimate Total revenue per available seat mile: up 2.4% ""2019 was a truly outstanding year on all fronts - the best in Delta's history operationally, financially and for our customers,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in the report. ""As we enter 2020, demand for travel is healthy and our brand preference is growing, positioning Delta to deliver another year of strong results, including earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.75.""  The airline company is gambling on increased travel within the US, and has invested in several travel hubs through new flightpaths and upgraded terminals. Domestic revenue grew 7.7% in the fourth quarter, more than any other regional category. Revenue and profit margin improved across all of Delta's domestic hubs, according to the report.  Delta has also benefited from a lack of exposure to the Boeing 737 Max. The best-selling jet model was grounded in March after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. Though the return of the model will boost industry seating supply and likely water-down prices, Delta's insulation from the jet's disaster placed in an advantageous position compared to peers running the Max. Delta opened at $60.74 per share on Tuesday, up about 1.4% year-to-date. The airline has 12 ""buy"" ratings, nine ""hold"" ratings, and no ""sell"" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $67.71, according to Bloomberg data.

Comments. People Who Read,"Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL) is slated to release its full-year 2019 results on Tuesday, January 14. Trefis details expectations from the airline company in an interactive dashboard, parts of which are highlighted below. We believe that Delta Airlines will report weaker-than-expected revenues and earnings for FY 2019. We expect Delta to report revenues of $46.8 billion for the year thanks to growing capacity across destinations, although our estimate is slightly below the consensus figure of $46.9 billion. Also, earnings are likely to be around $6.67 (vs. consensus estimate of $7.01) due to a combination of lower-than-expected revenues and elevated operating expenses. That said, we believe that weaker-than-expected revenues and earnings for FY 2019 do not take away from Delta’s strong growth opportunity in the near future, and estimate Delta Airlines’ valuation to be $63 a share – roughly 5% above its current market price. A Quick Look at Delta Airlines’ Revenues Delta Airlines’ reported $43.5 billion in Total Revenues for full-year 2018. It includes three revenue streams: [1] Total Revenues expected to be slightly below consensus estimates [2] EPS expected to increase from $5.67 in 2018 to $6.67 in 2019, supported by lower fuel prices You can input your own estimates for the company’s key metrics and see how that will affect the company’s stock price in our interactive dashboard.

A dividend-paying pot stock may sound like a contradiction but for the first time it’s being raised as a possibility. Aphria Inc. would like to return money to shareholders, Chief Financial Officer Carl Merton told analysts on the company’s earnings call Tuesday. The Canadian cannabis producer has posted three consecutive quarters of positive adjusted Ebitda, a rarity in the industry, and aims to continue that trend “to both internally finance future growth initiatives and, in the future, being in the position to provide an annual return to our shareholders through dividends,” Merton said. It’s a bold statement in an emerging industry that’s seen its benchmark ETFs plunge more than 60 per cent since March amid disappointing earnings results, which have included large Ebitda losses from most companies. While Aphria stands out for its profitability, the numbers are tiny with second-quarter adjusted Ebitda coming in at $1.9 million. Shares fell as much as 11 per cent in early trading after the company missed second-quarter revenue estimates and cut its full-year forecast.

Vistara Airlines | Premium airlines | Aviation Arindam Majumder  |  New Delhi 
Last Updated at January 13, 2020 01:08 IST In a significant change of strategy, Vistara has decided to drop business class and premium economy seating from some of its aircraft. The airline, a joint venture of Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, has a three-class cabin. Since inception, it has tried to differentiate itself as a premium brand, in an Indian market dominated by low-cost carriers (LCCs) where intense competition narrows the space to raise fares. The change underlines the necessity of a hybrid product for full-service airlines in the Indian market, despite the risk of operational complexity and confusing of customers. Both Air India and now-grounded Jet Airways had earlier tried the same strategy; Jet later rolled it back. “The Indian market has a situation in which full-service airlines, having a 50 per cent higher cost structure than LCCs, compete by matching fares rather than reducing costs. But, their cabin occupancy always remains lower than LCCs. This is due to the impact of lower loads in business class; the differential is significant,” goes a report from aviation consultants CAPA. Sources aware of Vistara’s fleet planning said of the 50 narrow-body A320 and A321 aircraft it had ordered, it has since asked Airbus to send around 10 of those in all-economy configurations. The aircraft will then have 180 seats, against 164, in a three-class cabin. Vistara will operate these aircraft between Tier B and Tier C cities, where there is less demand for premium class seating, said people aware of the plan. As of now, it will continue to serve on-board meals in all aircraft. There is currently one such plane in Vistara’s fleet, in all-economy configuration. The airline acquired it from grounded Icelandic carrier WOW Air in the aftermath of Jet Airways shutdown, to take advantage of the resulting gap in capacity. Said a Vistara spokesperson: “The all-economy aircraft tends to be deployed on routes with weaker demand for front cabins or on seasonal leisure routes. We may have a few such aircraft in the future to serve these","Jan 13, 2020",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/full-service-vistara-decides-to-junk-premium-class-on-low-income-routes-120011200482_1.html

The historic short squeeze is over – can the TSLA rally survive? By: Francois Aure | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock surged to a record high above $500 a share on Monday as bullish abandon engulfed the United States’ most valuable car manufacturer. The big question for Wall Street bulls is just how much of this rally is related to a successful push into China, and how much is linked to a historic short-squeeze. Amid the pure euphoria of proving the naysayers wrong, Tesla investors have driven the stock within striking distance of a $100 billion market cap. This milestone would earn Elon Musk a massive payday, but this is peanuts compared to what the rally has done for the billionaire’s net worth. For investors trying to maintain a level head, there is a nagging issue with trading TSLA. It’s difficult to know how much of the recent move to the upside is thanks to the short squeeze and how much is built on fundamentals. Wall Street tried to bury Tesla with shorts, and it nearly succeeded as the stock fell well beneath $200 in 2019. When the tables turned with impressive earnings reports and brighter fundamentals, brow-beaten Tesla shares skyrocketed. Correlation between reduced short-interest and a rising share price has been impossible to ignore. Ironically, overcrowding could now be a problem for TSLA bulls. Bearish interest has plunged over","Jan 13, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/will-tesla-stocks-insane-rally-survive-the-death-of-a-brutal-short-squeeze/

16,Commoditize Definition,"Commoditize. What Is Commoditization?. KEY TAKEAWAYS. Understanding Commoditization. . Commoditization Challenges Businesses. Commoditization Benefits Consumers. Compete Risk Free with $100,000","The term ""commoditize"" refers to a process in which goods or services become relatively indistinguishable from the same offerings presented by a rival company. Generally speaking, commoditized products within specific categories are so similar to one another that they are only distinguished by the price tags attached to them. Commoditization runs the gamut across consumer goods, ranging from computer keyboards to software programs that manage complex processes like supply chain management and business accounting. Although it may sound counter-intuitive, the path to commoditization typically first begins when a company introduces a revolutionary new product or substantially improves an existing product. In either case, premium pricing is justified for the items in question. For example, in 2007, Apple Inc. (AAPL) introduced the iPhone, which boasted differentiating features like a touch-screen interface, as well as multitasking capabilities that let owners surf the web while engaged on a phone call. Before all of these features were eventually commoditized, the iPhone stood out from all other mobile phones on the market, and cell phone consumers were lining up to shell out big bucks for the chance own such innovative technology. When rival companies began copying Apple’s cutting-edge mobile phone features, the once-unique functions became mainstreamed and readily available everywhere—also known as commoditized. Meanwhile, Apple continued to differentiate its iPhones by regularly releasing updated versions, with exciting new functions that were then unavailable from the competition. For example, in 2011, Apple introduced the iPhone 4s, which featured the voice-activated digital assistant, Siri. This never-before-seen technology distinguished the iPhones from competitive models and drew tremendous buzz from customers as well as the media. Commoditization is good for consumers who enjoy cheaper prices for the same goods that are more expensive elsewhere, but it is a tricky prospect for businesses, who run the risk of going under if they slash prices too radically in an effort to remain competitive. Products that lack distinguishing features tend to eventually decline in price and cause dwindling profit margins. Therefore, companies strive to delay commoditization, as long as possible, in order to maintain the special status of their product offerings. One way in which a company can delay commoditization is by bundling its commoditized products or services with related offerings, to create attractive packaging that has a unique combination of offerings—even if the offerings themselves are commonplace. For example, cable companies routinely bundle highly commoditized landline phones with internet and television","Jan 13, 2020",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commoditize.asp
