0,Will Warren Buffett Buy an Airline? Or Is He Looking to Sell? | The Motley Fool,"Will Warren Buffett Buy an Airline? Or Is He Looking to Sell?. Airline stocks have plunged over the past month,","   In late 2016, investors were shocked to learn that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) had invested in the four largest U.S. airlines: American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). True, the U.S. airline industry had turned in several years of strong earnings at that point. However, Buffett had been burned before from investing in the airline industry and had been warning investors about the danger of investing in airlines for two decades. Today, Berkshire Hathaway owns stakes of roughly 10% in all four of these airlines -- slightly more for Delta; slightly less for the others. As of a few months ago, its airline investments had done fairly well. Its top three airline holdings -- Delta, Southwest, and United -- ended 2019 with a combined market value of $8.6 billion, 37% ahead of Berkshire's cost basis. But since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused air travel to crater, crushing airline stocks.  AIRLINE STOCK PERFORMANCE DATA BY YCHARTS. The depressed valuations across the airline sector could entice Buffett to consider buying an airline outright. After all, Berkshire Hathaway ended 2019 with $128 billion of cash and short-term investments that Buffett has been eager to put into higher-return investments. That said, the sharp turnaround in the airline sector's fortunes could also persuade Buffett to bail on his airline investments. In Berkshire Hathaway's recent annual report, Buffett underscored his belief that stocks will dramatically outperform bonds over the long run. ""What we can say is that if something close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments,"" he wrote. WARREN BUFFETT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IN THE VALUE OF LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN STOCKS. IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL. Based on that analysis, the present bear market represents an excellent opportunity to deploy some of Berkshire's massive $128 billion cash pile. Airline stocks have been particularly hard hit. Southwest Airlines stock has fallen 30% year to date, while shares of American, Delta, and United have all lost about half of their value -- even more, in United's case. That has left them trading at very low valuations relative to their 2019 earnings.

1,Why Shares of United Airlines Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of United Airlines Are Falling Today. Airline management admits the $50 billion bailout package might not be enough..,"   Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) fell more than 14% earlier in the day as investors continue to weigh the significant challenges facing the industry. As of 4:20 p.m. EDT, the stock was down 8%. Airline stocks enjoyed a multi-day rally last week as Congress finalized an industry relief bill, but United issued a dire warning after markets closed Friday that caused that momentum to collapse. Airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, which has caused travel demand to fall to near-zero. United and other airlines have responded by cutting flights and grounding aircraft, but no amount of cost cutting is enough if there isn't revenue coming through the door. Lawmakers earmarked $50 billion in loans and grants for the industry as part of a broader $2 trillion economic stimulus plan designed to help the airlines weather the storm. The money comes with restrictions, including prohibiting layoffs or furloughs through Sept. 30. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. In a message to employees after markets closed Friday, United CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby said the assistance ""buys us time to adapt,"" but warned that if traffic doesn't return by the fall, they would have to consider deeper cuts when the prohibition on layoffs ends. ""If the recovery is as slow as we fear, it means our airline and our workforce will have to be smaller than it is today,"" the executives wrote. It's hard to criticize management for trying to be as honest and transparent as possible when addressing workers, but it would have been nice for Munoz and Kirby to at least let the ink dry on the bailout bill before talking about what could come next. Their warning is fair, however: If traffic returns once the pandemic is under control, the airlines now have the financial runway to survive the downturn and restart operations when the time comes. But if travelers don't return in the months that come, these airlines will have to start making some of the temporary cuts more permanent. That's a worst-case scenario and isn't necessarily what will happen. But the warning, if nothing else, should be a reminder to investors not to get ahead of themselves post-bailout and assume airlines will gain altitude from here. I think the industry will be able to fly through this storm, and there are attractive valuations available for those willing to buy","Mar 30, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/30/why-shares-of-united-airlines-are-falling-today.aspx
2,UAL Stock: United Airlines Isn't Worth Betting On ... Yet | InvestorPlace,United Airlines Stock Isn’t Worth Betting On … Yet. It's not safe to own UAL stock until circumstances change. Problems," Enterprising traders may be tempted to buy airline stocks because of the low prices. However, bargain hunters need to really weigh the pros and cons of owning United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock. It might be worth buying eventually, but today isn’t the day.  It will take time before the impact of the coronavirus from China is fully understood. Travel bans, flight cancellations and airplane groundings indicate more pain ahead for UAL stock. We’re all rooting for the major American airlines to recover, but that doesn’t mean you should jump into an unfavorable trade. It’s just one setback after another for United and other airlines. Before even considering a long position in UAL stock, it’s wise to wait for at least a solid month without any major problems. For instance, President Donald Trump recently added to the growing list of travel restrictions with a tweet, saying, “We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic.” This occurred at around the same time the White House closed the U.S.’s border with Mexico. Prior to that, travel restrictions from Europe to the U.S. were imposed. You can even bookmark the U.S. Department of State’s regularly updated list of international travel bans and restrictions. Just checking that list on a daily basis should be enough to dissuade you from considering owning UAL stock for the time being. There’s still room for the U.S. government to ban interstate flights. Plus, more nations could restrict travel between nations. And due to the havoc that the coronavirus has wreaked on the travel industry, United announced that the company is considering more flight-capacity cuts for the months of May and June. Granted, the U.S. government’s $60 billion airline-bailout package should provide some relief. It should be noted, though, that the bailout involves certain restrictions concerning dividend payouts, stock-share buybacks and employee layoffs. Along with the government’s layoff restrictions, United Airlines Chief Executive Oscar Munoz announced that his company is making an effort to avoid sending workers home. He stated in a memo, “United will not conduct involuntary furloughs or pay cuts in the U.S. before September 30th.” YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE Irrespective of the CEO’s best intentions, it’s hard to imagine that United will be able to avoid furloughs and pay cuts this year.

3,Will the Rescue Package Help American Airlines Stock Reach Its Recent Highs? | InvestorPlace,Will the Rescue Package Help American Airlines Stock Reach Its Recent Highs?. The current stimulus package may not be enough," The adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is being felt by many industries and shares, including the American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock price. Year-to-date AAL stock is down more than 51% while the S&P 500 index is off 18.6%. With last week’s approval of a big rescue for the aviation sector, investors are wondering how concerned they should be about the future of travel and tourism shares, especially of airline stocks. Today I’d like to discuss the segment and AAL stock more in detail so that you can make a better-informed decision about your holdings. President Trump signed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law March 27 that includes more than $50 billion for commercial airlines, including $25 billion in direct grants. CEO Doug Parker said the carrier could get $12 billion in federal assistance, although there are questions about what sort of conditions grants and loans could come with. Many investors will know that this is not the first time that the federal government has come to the rescue of industries and companies. For example, following the events of 9/11 in 2001, Congress passed the “Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act” and approved a $15 billion bailout package for the airline industry. We had also witnessed the concept of too-big-to-fail in the aftermath of the 2008/09 financial crisis, when several industries received crucial help from the government. However, there was widespread criticism at the time. The public, many politicians, and analysts felt that the bailout package then had not done much to for the average American. Furthermore, many companies, including airlines, had spent their extra cash to buyback shares and increase compensation for corporate executives. On the other hand, the current bailout package aims to address a number of points that are likely to help protect jobs for airlines employees. In other words, it comes with several strings attached. The stimulus package “would prohibit stock buybacks and share dividends for at least a year after the loans have been repaid. It also restricts executive compensation.” According to a recent Barron’s article, “from 2009 to 2018, 465 companies in the S&P 500 index spent $4.3 trillion on stock buybacks, equal to 52% of their combined profits … In the airline industry alone, American, Delta, United, and Southwest, as well as Fedex and UPS, spent heavily, with $77 billion in buybacks (56% of profits) and $35 billion in","Mar 30, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/03/will-the-rescue-package-help-aal-stock-reach-its-recent-highs/

HA, the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, have plunged 44.6% compared with the industry’s 35.6% decline in the past month. Hawaiian Airlines, like most other airline stocks, has been hit hard by the sharp drop in air-travel demand due to the coronavirus outbreak that has resulted in depreciation. COVID-19 Woes Dent Growth Due to the coronavirus-induced sharp drop in air-travel demand, Hawaiian Airlines withdrew its first-quarter 2020 and full-year guidance. Moreover, the airlines trimmed its schedule for Neighbor Islands from Mar 25. This was in response to the quarantine order (effective Mar 26) from the Hawaii government asking travelers, who enter the state, to undergo a mandatory self-imposed quarantine of 14 days. The carrier will, however, continue to operate a network, essential for customers traveling within the state and the Hawaiian Islands. Thanks to travel restrictions and evaporating demand, the carrier extended its inter-island cargo services to facilitate movement of certain essentials including food and medicine. With passenger revenues dwindling, Hawaiian Airlines’ focus on offering cargo charter services are expected to boost the top line. With increase in COVID-19 cases and government restrictions, Hawaiian Airlines reduced its flight schedule nearly by 40% in April. Notably, other carriers are also resorting to significant capacity cuts, due to the above-mentioned factors. For instance, Copa Holdings CPA suspended all its operations effective Mar 22 through Apr 21. It became the first Latin American carrier to enforce such a strict action against the outbreak. Additionally, JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU will carry out a large number of flight cancelations this week and operate a schedule less than 50% its normal. The airline expects to cut flights even more in the coming month. Meanwhile, United Airlines’ UAL international schedule will be reduced by approximately 90% in April.

8,Why Air Canada Stock (TSX:AC) Can Double Your Money - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why Air Canada Stock (TSX:AC) Can Double Your Money. The economy will,"      David Jagielski | March 30, 2020 | More on: AC One of the biggest casualties of this market crash are travel stocks. After all, with no one traveling and with people having to stay indoors, generating revenue is going to be difficult, to say the least. Shares of Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) are down more than 60% in 2020, and that’s mainly a result of the coronavirus. That’s unusual territory for the stock, which, from 2017 through to the end of 2019, soared more than 250%. It’s been a big cliff that Air Canada shares have gone over in recent weeks. However, investors shouldn’t be so quick to write off the stock just yet. In fact, buying today could set you up for some terrific returns later on. But you don’t have to take my word for it; take billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s. He has multiple airline stocks in his portfolio, and he recently said he has no interest in selling. While a pandemic is serious and will impact the economy, he doesn’t believe that it will be a long-term problem, telling Yahoo Finance that “It won’t stop the progress of the country or the world.” As one of top airlines in the country, there’s too much at stake for the federal government to not help Air Canada, especially if the airline were on its last legs — which it isn’t. The airline has more than $2 billion cash and cash equivalents on its books, and in 2019 it generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion. As it cuts down its operations and sheds all the costs that it can, the company will still be in a good position to weather the storm. And let’s not forget that with interest rates declining yet again, it’ll be cheap for the company to raise debt if it needs to fill in any gaps along the way that may arise. It may take a while for travelers to return and for planes to be back in the skies on a full-time basis, but, at this point, there’s no reason to be concerned that the company won’t be able to recover. The stock is in the dumps right now and, quite frankly, it may stay there for a while.

9,Why I'm Still Not Buying Singapore Airlines Shares - The Good Investors,Why I’m Not Buying Singapore Airlines Shares Even After Temasek Promised To Save It. The rescue. How did it get,"The Good Investors How to invest in stocks Temasek is underwriting a massive rights offering that will provide Singapore Airlines with much needed capital. But here’s why I’m still not convinved. Much ink has been spilt on the whole Singapore Airlines Ltd (SGX: C6L) fiasco.  The latest news now is that Temasek, one of the Singapore government’s investment arms, has stepped in to provide our country’s flag carrier with much-needed capital.  This comes as Singapore Airlines (SIA) is confronting liquidity problems due to its high debt load and fixed costs, and the disruption to its business because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In essence, Temasek, which currently owns around 55% of SIA, has underwritten a S$5.3 billion equity fundraising by the airline. Temasek has also underwritten a $9.7 billion issuance of mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) by SIA; the MCBs will either be converted to shares in 10 years or redeemed before then. What this means is that Temasek will not only subscribe to all the rights and relevant bonds that it’s entitled to; it will also purchase any of the rights or bonds that other SIA shareholders do not want. But despite Temasek coming in to save the day, I’m not interested in investing in SIA, even at these seemingly low prices. Much like other airline companies, SIA is heavily leveraged due to the capital-intensive nature of its business. The high cost of replacing and upgrading SIA’s fleet has also led to negative free cash flow in four of the last five years. To keep itself afloat, our flag carrier has been increasingly making use of the debt markets for its cash flow requirements. In fact, the company issued bonds to the public just last year to raise more capital. At the end of 2019, the airline had S$1.6 billion in cash, but S$7.7 billion in total debt. The aviation industry is highly competitive too and the emergence of low-cost carriers have led to thinner margins for airlines. The COVID-19 pandemic was the straw that broke the camel’s back as the significant loss of revenue (SIA recently cut 96% of its flight capacity) finally led to severe cash flow problems for the company and Temasek ultimately had to step in to save the day. Let’s be clear, this is not a government bailout. It is nothing like what the American airlines got from the US government, which included a","Mar 30, 2020",https://www.thegoodinvestors.sg/why-im-not-buying-singapore-airlines-shares-even-after-temasek-promised-to-save-it/
10,Airline Investors: We've Been Here Before | Hero Stocks : Financial and Investment News,Airline Investors: We’Ve Been Here Before. I consent to receiving information from Hero Stocks via email. I understand I can," Alan Joyce, CEO of Australia’s flagship carrier Qantas Airways (QAN), has never seen anything like it. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been “the single biggest shock that global aviation has ever experienced,” he said in a recent memo to the airline’s 30,000 staff members. Due to global travel restrictions in the days since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, airlines have been seeing more cancellations than bookings, forcing them to slash capacity and send staff home. The decline in demand as a result of the spread of COVID-19 could end up being double the decline from the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, according to travel research firm Tourism Economics. This implies 16 million lost passengers, which is more than the multi-year impact following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Like most of the rest of the market, domestic airline stocks have sold off, with United (UAL) dropping the most at negative 74 percent year-to-date through March 19. American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) were also down significantly. Southwest (LUV) was down the least, falling 38 percent over the same period, due to its having far less international exposure as well as a stronger balance sheet than its larger peers. The virus, according to United CEO Oscar Munoz, has created “an unprecedented challenge.” Be that as it may, I see it as having created an attractive buying opportunity. Air travel isn’t going away. At some point, the threat of the coronavirus will subside, and people will once again need to quickly get from point A to point B, either for business or leisure. Perhaps we’ll fly in rockets in the future, or rely on Star Trek-style beam technology, but for now, the only thing that can provide that sort of speed and dependability is a passenger jet. I’m not in any way negating the severity of COVID-19 or the economic mayhem it’s caused. But in all fairness, this is not the first major headwind that global airlines have been up against. The truth is that air travel has proved to be remarkably resilient to many external shocks, whether they be oil crises, wars, terrorist attacks or, yes, pandemics. Such events may have temporarily halted the increase in the number of passengers that take to the skies every year, but once the crisis was behind us, growth tended to resume.

11,"Airline stocks have crashed, is now a good time to get on board? - Go Money Smart","Airline stocks have crashed, is now a good time to get on board?. Airlines are cyclical businesses. The global airline","Covid-19 is causing incredible human losses and is spreading fast across all societies around the world. Countries have closed borders and the skies have turned empty. Many airlines have cut down their capacity from 85% up to a complete grounding off all airliners.

The travel ban and lack of demand for airlines have hit the airlines hard on the stock market as well. It’s clear that many investors have fled out the travel and leisure sectors. As individual investors we can focus on the long term returns. That raises the question, are airline stocks now a bargain for big future gains? Traditionally, airlines are typical cyclical businesses. This means they go up and down with the economic cycle. When the economy is doing well, airline stocks will go up, but when economy is contracting, the stocks will plummet. Usually, the cyclical stocks are a bit ahead of the economic cycle and will fall hard and deep early in a recession, but will also recover before most other stocks start to recover. However, what we experiencing now is not an ordinary recession or economic slowdown and risks are therefore different and bigger. Over the last years, the global airline industry estimated a growth in passenger numbers and revenues into infinity. Although, the outlook seemed favourable, with increasing wealth in Asia, and China in particular, Europe has seen a troubled industry. Air Berlin, Alitalia, FLYBMI, Monarch and WOW all collapsed. In Europe there is strong competition amongst low cost carriers (LCC), like Ryanair, Norwegian, Easyjet, Wizz, Vueling, to name a few. The competition is eroding margins and travellers are comparing prices in order to find the best deals. Airlines are close to becoming commodities, and with a few exceptions, there are no real competitive advantages or moats in the industry.

Nobody knows when the airlines can get back on the runways again and fly passengers across Europe and beyond. Nor does anyone know how quickly consumers will get back to flying. The recession and closure of many businesses during lock down will create a situation where we’ll see high unemployment and less spending by consumers, delaying the take-off of airlines. Personally, I believe in one to two years airlines will be back in the skies. By then we hope to have a vaccine and treatment for Covid-19 and consumers will be flying again.

13,Boeing Stock Could Still Benefit From the Covid-19 Disruption. Here’s How. | Barron's,Boeing Could Still Benefit From the Covid-19 Disruption. Here’s How.. Newsletter Sign-up. Review & Preview. ,"  A huge swath of the global commercial aviation fleet is grounded because of the Covid-19 coronavirus. The aviation industry—airlines as well as Boeing and its aerospace suppliers—have been hammered by the outbreak. But there is one potential reason for optimism resulting from all the recent industry turmoil: Much of the grounded fleet isn’t coming back. “With the latest data showing that airlines have grounded more than 8,500 planes…we think it is likely that a large number of old planes do not return to passenger service,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said in a Monday research report. “In previous downturns we have seen a spike in old aircraft retirements, and after a period of unusually low retirements in 2018-19, this could occur again.” About one-third of the global commercial jet fleet is parked. It is an incredible number. It is hard to predict, of course, what will happen when air travel returns to some normalcy. An aircraft’s useful life “varies wildly by all of the usual variables,” Teal Group aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia said in an interview. The variables include, among other things, fuel prices and interest rates. Fuel prices are a big part of a plane’s operating costs. When fuel is cheap, the absolute dollar savings from more-efficient, new engine technology is lower. That can reduce pressure on airlines to upgrade aircraft fleets. Stallard, for his part, thinks air travel will fall 40% in 2020, recover some in 2021 and 2022 and then resume the 5% growth it has averaged for about a generation. Under this scenario, it would take roughly seven years get back to 2019 traffic levels. It is looking like a lost decade for commercial aerospace. Accelerated aircraft retirement would help the demand situation for Boeing (ticker: BA) and suppliers, but it can’t fix everything. “Having put the lower [capacity] growth numbers and increased retirement rate through our [plane] supply/demand model, we come up with a requirement for about 6,300 new aircraft over the next 5 years,” Stallard said. “This compares with our previous forecast of about 8,300 aircraft.” That is down about 25% and is a big cut to demand. Now the question, as always, for investors is what is in the stocks? U.S. airline shares are down about 53% on average. At their nadir, sector stocks were down more than 60% on average.

Boeing and,"                                       NEWS Justin Kuepper Mar 30, 2020 The COVID-19 outbreak has shut down large swaths of the economy, and a growing number of blue chip companies have suspended their dividends. Boeing Co. (BA) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) have become the latest casualties of the crisis, suspending their dividends to shore up capital as the airline industry struggles with an unprecedented drop in demand. Let us look into the implications of dividend suspensions and what it could mean for investors. Find the dividend yield of the major airlines and major aerospace defense companies here and here. You can also get an individual company count and dividend yield of industries within the financial sector. Boeing, the largest U.S. aerospace supplier, has been struggling since the grounding of the 737 MAX in March 2019. The problems with the flagship jetliner have already cost nearly 350 lives and at least $18.7 billion in expenses — not including the damage to the company’s once-stellar reputation. The COVID-19 crisis is expected to cause a shock worse than the 9/11 terrorist attacks or the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009. In addition to at least 13 airlines across the world going out of business since the begining of 2019, the significant drop in air travel due to COVID-19 could cause many customers to delay or cancel their orders — compounding Boeing’s problems. On March 20, Being released a corporate statement saying “Boeing is drawing on all of its resources to sustain operations, support its workforce and customers, and maintain supply chain continuity through the COVID-19 crisis and for the long-term.” The company is seeking at least $60 billion in government aid to support the company and its supply chain, including public and private liquidity and loan guarantees.

18,Coronavirus: when will airlines recover? - Morningstar.com.au,News. Coronavirus: when will airlines recover?. Related Articles. Related Videos,"  The impact of the coronavirus on the airline industry has been swift and severe. Travel bans have forced airlines to slash capacity, temporarily lay off staff and cut capital expenditure. Load factors – a metric which refers to the percentage of bums on seats – have fallen well below analysts' expectations. United Airlines management anticipates load factors could fall into the 20 per cent - 30 per cent range if demand trends don't worsen; the firm's recent full-year load factors have been in the low 80s. However, analysts doubt the disruption will affect long-term global travel, and that the shock to the travel industry will be temporary. They expect the airline industry will start recovering on pent-up demand by the end of the year. ""We continue to believe that once coronavirus fears fade, air traffic will improve and could overshoot normalised demand for a period as pent-up demand (for example, postponed family vacations or business conferences) is released,"" Morningstar analysts say in a special report on the coronavirus, its effect on markets, and which stocks are worth looking it. ""So, despite weak short-term earnings, we anticipate the travel downturn to be short-lived and firms with strong balance sheets to be able to weather the storm. ""We anticipate a U-shaped impact on demand from COVID-19, similar to the shape of the impact experienced during SARS in 2002, and forecast a return to capacity growth from early calendar 2021."" While it’s still early, this has already begun happening in China. ""The Chinese carriers began to see traffic bottom in mid-February with fewer flights canceled,"" analysts say.  ""Assuming the conditions in China continue to stabilise, we expect domestic passenger traffic to bounce back to 2019 levels in the third quarter of 2020."" Longer-term, analysts expect growth in the Asian middle class to drive relatively strong passenger growth. In the meantime, they say Australian and New Zealand national carriers Qantas (ASX: QAN) and Air New Zealand (NZE : AIR) can also offset the impact. ""At these airlines, we anticipate labour costs, which make up around one third of their operating costs, are largely fixed, weighing on profitability,"" they say. ""However, they do have levers to pull to reduce the impact, including executive pay cuts, hiring freezes, and voluntary leave for employees."" ""We expect the reduction in fuel bills—both from lower consumption due to cuts in capacity and the lower jet fuel","Mar 30, 2020",https://www.morningstar.com.au/stocks/article/coronavirus-when-will-airlines-recover/201006
