0,Airlines Are Raising More Money — and Their Stocks Are Falling | Barron's,Airlines Are Raising More Money — and Their Stocks Are Falling. . . Here’s BofA’s List of 4 Enterprise Software,"    Airlines are raising capital again, pressuring some of the stocks. But analysts continue to see value in the domestic budget carriers, arguing that they will benefit from a rebound in leisure travel. American Airlines Group (ticker: AAL) said in a filing on Monday that it was raising $3.5 billion through a mix of senior secured debt, common stock, convertible notes, and a new term loan facility. United Airlines Holdings (UAL), meanwhile, is gearing up to issue $5 billion in debt this week, according to Bloomberg, using its frequent-flier mileage program as collateral. Shares of American were off 6% in Monday morning trading, while United’s stock was down 3%. Airline balance sheets are getting stressed with more debt, and equity values are being diluted as carriers issue more stock. Some analysts continue to favor the low-cost carriers, arguing their focus on the domestic leisure market gives them an edge in a recovery. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth upgraded shares of Allegiant Travel (ALGT) to a Strong Buy rating on Monday and raised her price target to $135 from $115. The upgrade reflects “our view of both a faster earnings recovery (due to the leisure and geographical exposure) and lower risk relative to U.S. peers heading into the fall,” she writes. Shares of Allegiant were up 0.9% in trading Monday, to $109. Syth continues to prefer airlines with a larger share of the domestic/leisure travel. Along with Allegiant, she has Strong Buy ratings on Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Southwest Airlines (LUV). She also has a Strong Buy on Delta Air Lines (DAL) and expects SkyWest (SKYW), a carrier that contracts with Alaska, American, Delta, and United, to be a “structural winner” in the regional market. American, however, looks like dicier. The airline is adding back more capacity than its peers, gambling on demand rebounding sharply. That could pay off if travel recovers through the summer and into the fall, enabling American to capture more share than United and Delta. If demand doesn’t materialize, because of a second virus wave, however, it will pressure American’s already shaky liquidity position. Airline traffic has been building for weeks with the summer travel season now in full swing. Domestic fares are picking up, averaging $324 for the week ending June 15, up from $308 in early May, according to Cowen’s fare tracker of American, Delta, and United.

American Airlines is raising another $3.5 billion, validating Warren Buffett's decision to dump the 'big four' carriers. SHARE THIS","   Alex Wong / Getty Images  American Airlines is planning to raise $3.5 billion to weather the coronavirus pandemic, supporting Warren Buffett's decision to sell his shares in the carrier as well as in Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines in April. American intends to sell $1.5 billion of debt in a private offering, issue $750 million in common stock and $750 million in convertible debt in a public offering, and enter into a $500 million loan facility, the company said in a pair of press releases on Sunday. The other ""big four"" airlines have made similar moves. Delta has raised over $14 billion since the beginning of March, CEO Ed Bastian said at the carrier's annual meeting last week, according to Sentieo, a financial-research site.  Meanwhile, Southwest has raised about $16.7 billion this year, and United has raised billions as well.

They received a mixture of cash grants and loans, and agreed to issue warrants to the Treasury that it can use to buy their shares at a fixed price in the future and sell them for a profit if their stock prices recover. Buffett said at his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate's annual meeting in May that the four carriers' aggressive fundraising factored into his decision to sell their shares. ""They are each going to borrow perhaps an average of at least $10 or $12 billion each,"" the famed investor said. ""You have to pay that back out of earnings.""

2,Why Shares of American Airlines Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of American Airlines Are Falling Today. The company is selling shares and adding to its debt.. What happened.,"   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) traded down more than 6% as of 12:30 p.m. EDT Monday after the airline said it would raise $3.5 billion in new financing. It will get some of that new capital by diluting existing shareholders, and the stock is taking a hit as a result. American and other airlines are in survival mode, with demand plummeting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been some indications in recent weeks that travel demand is slowly beginning to creep higher compared to April lows, but it will likely take years for traffic volumes to return to prepandemic levels. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. With the recovery expected to be slow, the airlines are aggressively adding to their cash balances to ensure they can ride out the storm. American on Sunday said it was selling $750 million in new shares and raising a similar amount via convertible notes due in 2025. The airline is also offering $1.5 billion in new senior secured notes and has entered into a new $500 million term loan facility. American expects to burn through about $40 million per day in June, but hopes it can get that number down to breakeven by the end of 2020. But with new COVID-19 cases on the rise in a number of key states, it is impossible to say for sure those targets will be reached. The debt is expensive. American's secured notes are expected to yield about 12%, according to Bloomberg, a significant premium to what nonairlines are paying in this low-rate environment and well above the 7% yield Delta Air Lines was forced to pay on a $3.5 billion secured bond back in April. In the short term, secondary offerings hurt shareholders because they mean the pie is divided into even more pieces, meaning each individual share is worth less. And it is going to take American a long time to pay down all this expensive debt, meaning interest payments are going to eat into earnings for years to come. But given the plight American is in, this still looks like a good long-term move. The big risk for shareholders is a second wave of the pandemic, which could further depress travel demand and delay an already slow recovery. In a worst case, American runs low on cash, forcing the airline to seek bankruptcy protection and in all likelihood wiping out the","Jun 22, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/22/why-shares-of-american-airlines-are-falling-today.aspx

Gap — Shares of the retailer surged more than 8% after the stock received a double upgrade from Wells Fargo. The bank upgraded the stock to overweight from underweight, saying the market was undervaluing the company’s Athleta brand and that the stock was a “a highly compelling risk/reward” opportunity. Wells Fargo set a $19 per share price target on the stock, up from $8 previously. Livongo Health — Livongo Health shares jumped 6.4% after a KeyBanc analyst hiked his price target on the company to $85 per share from $52. The analyst said regulatory relief on remote patient monitoring could “create a new ~$15B ‘greenfield’ opportunity for LVGO to sell its digital health services directly to hospitals and physicians serving Medicare populations.” TripAdvisor — TripAdvisor dropped as much as 5.5% after the company said it expects a “significantly negative” adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter. Citing the “the extraordinary circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic.” Overall, the company expects an adjusted EBITDA loss of about $85 million. That’s below a FactSet estimate of an $86.5 million loss. Albemarle — A KeyBanc analyst downgraded the chemical company to underweight from sector weight, citing concerns over the “long-term overinvestment and commoditization of the lithium industry driven by China-based players” which means “new supply can come online quickly at low capital cost.” The stock fell 3.3% on the downgrade.

Virgin Galactic will develop a “private orbital astronaut readiness program” under the agreement, which will be similar to the one needed to prepare space tourists.

American Airlines has announced a new financing initiative that will significantly dilute shareholder value. Warren Buffett was right to quit. By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. After Warren Buffett dumped the big four U.S. airlines in April, he gave the reason: We will not fund a company … where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future. Less than two months later, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is proving the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) chairman and CEO right. The heavily-indebted airline is now seeking to add to its debt. On Sunday, American revealed that it would be raising $3.5 billion in new financing. American’s debt at the end of the first quarter stood at $34 billion. After entirely exiting his stakes in the four major U.S. airlines, Warren Buffett came under instant fire. Among those who criticized him included President Donald Trump and Raytheon Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes. Trump called Buffett’s move a “mistake” while Hayes said Buffett was wrong about the future of airlines. To add insult to injury, the airline stocks went on to rally after a brutal selloff–leading many to question Buffett’s judgment. The big four U.S. airlines are still a favorite among millennial investors. The four–American, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL)–are among the top 35 stocks on Robinhood that saw the largest increase in new investors over the past 30 days.

(AAL) is planning to raise as much as $3.5 billion from stock and notes offerings, as the ailing U.S. carrier grapples with the financial fallout of the travel freeze triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S carrier plans to raise $1.5 billion from selling shares and convertible notes. It will also offer $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of secured senior notes due 2025. Upon closure of the notes offering, the airline seeks to enter into a new $500 million term loan B facility due 2024. As part of the share and convertibles notes offering, the airline will grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to $112,500,000 of shares of common stock, as well as a 30-day option to buy up to $112,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes. American Airlines said that it expects to use part of the net proceeds from the notes offering and borrowings under the term loan to refinance its delayed draw term loan facility it entered into on March 18 and is scheduled to mature on March 17. The net proceeds from the stock and convertible notes offerings will be used for general corporate purposes and to boost its liquidity position, the air carrier said. The stock has lost 44% of its value so far this year as stringent travel restrictions tied to the coronavirus pandemic have brought travel demand to an almost halt. U.S. airlines have been burning through billions of dollars in the first quarter incurring huge losses and implementing broad cost-cutting plans, as well as taking steps to shore up its cash buffers. Shares dropped 3% to $16 on Friday. Looking ahead, the $13.78 average analyst price target implies another 14% downside potential in the shares in the coming year.

It will take more than a slight rise in Covid-19 cases," Alongside a broader rebound in traveling demand and all airline stocks, shares of low-cost, domestic-focused airline carrier Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) have rallied big over the past month. From its mid-May lows, SAVE stock has more than doubled. This big rally in SAVE stock is both entirely warranted, and will continue over the next six to 18 months. In essence, a large portion of U.S. consumers and legislators have decided that, given recent changes in science, the social and economic consequences of a continued nationwide shutdown outweigh the human cost of the novel coronavirus pandemic. To that end, state and local authorities have begun reopening their economies over the past month. And consumers have normalized their economic and social behaviors. Also to that end, the emergence of a “second wave” of Covid-19 won’t derail this recovery, but rather simply slow it. Accordingly, consumer and business travel demand will continue to recover at a gradual pace over the next six to 18 months. As it does, Spirit Airlines growth trends will meaningfully improve, and beaten-up SAVE stock will stay in rebound mode. Net net, don’t fade this rally in SAVE stock. Buy it. Shares have visible 50%+ upside potential from here. The current recovery in economic activity (U.S. retail sales jumped 17% month-over-month in May) and air travel (U.S. air traffic is up 400% from its mid-April lows) will likely persist for the foreseeable future, even through the emergence of a potential second wave of Covid-19.

11,JBLU Stock: JetBlue Is Poised to Recover Faster Than Other Airlines | InvestorPlace,JetBlue Is Poised for a Faster Recovery. JBLU stock has held better than most of its peers during Covid-19. Valuing," JetBlue (NYSE:JBLU) has quietly been one of the best airline stocks in the group. That’s not to say JBLU stock hasn’t had its share of turbulence, but relative strength compared to many of its peers is a good sign. Shares are still down about 44% from its 2020 highs, but it lags only Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which is down about 38%. It’s only slightly better by American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), but either way, JBLU is looking good. Can the airline maintain altitude and continue to outperform? Let’s dig a little deeper on this one. Making a fundamental case for the airline group is difficult, to say the least. Revenue was almost shut off overnight, as passenger volume dried up across the board. We know this by looking at TSA traffic across U.S. airports. Traffic dropped by more than 90% at its trough and has been quite slow to recover. While the “reopening America” trade has been in full force over the past few weeks, the fundamentals tell a different story. Airlines are burning millions of dollars per day. That’s even as traffic comes back faster than previously expected. While Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and others are looking to lower their cash burn down to a $50 million per-day average by the end of the quarter, JetBlue is much lower than that. Of course, having a market cap of just $3.2 billion versus Delta’s $19.5 billion market cap helps in that regard. But JetBlue expected its cash burn to fall below $10 million per day in May and down to $5 million per day through the end of Q3 (JetBlue is in fiscal Q2 right now). At the end of April, the company had more than $3 billion in liquidity, ensuring that the current cash burn will not force JBLU stock into a liquidity issue. That is, assuming we continue to see a return to normalcy among the public and do not see a second wave of the novel coronavirus trigger a series of lockdowns across the U.S. For JetBlue, analysts expect the company to lose $3.50 per share this year, as revenue sinks 53% to $3.8 billion. These estimates are bound to change, but because the company is a regional carrier rather than having a large international presence, it’s forecast to rebound more quickly in 2021 than some of its peers.

SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE DAILY,"Investors who are looking into the airline sector-related exchange traded fund should consider the impact of COVID-19 on global airline industry and the potential long-term benefits of entering the market during a recovery period. On the recent webcast, Airline ETF Sees Liftoff on Stock Rebound, Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Global Investors, highlighted the growing bullishness on the airline industry and how investors are taking a contrarian play against long-time value guru Warren Buffett, whom took a $2.7 billion loss on airlines during the panic sell. Specifically, Holmes argued that Buffett’s risk tolerance has diminished with the coronavirus and his increasing age. The investment guru has also been know to be wrong occasionally, such as with Amazon.com, bitcoin and gold, and airline stocks may be Buffett’s next big fumble. Meanwhile, other investors have picked up where Buffett left off. As 70 days of consecutive inflows into the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEArca: JETS), the lone ETF dedicated to airline stocks, helped the fund grow to $1 billion in assets under management. Traders may have seen this ETF as an easy-to-use way to get in on an oversold market – airline stocks were the most oversold since 9/11 when rising fears of terrorist threats sent travel stocks reeling. The U.S. Global JETS Index, which acts as the underlying benchmark for JETS, was trading at a 5.7 price-to-earnings as of the end of March, compared to the 14.5 P/E for the broader S&P 500 Industrials Index. Meanwhile, since Buffett announced he dumped carriers, the U.S. Global JETS Index has surged 50%. Investors may draw similarities to what is happening now with travel stocks to what happened back during previous global crisis events. For instance, airline stocks rebounded in the following six months after the 9/11 crisis, surging more than 80%. Airline stocks climbed more than 120% in the six months after the SARS crisis. The sector also recovered more than 80%, following the 2009 financial crisis. However, unlike previous events, the White House has specifically provided targeted financial aid to the airline industry through the CARES Act – one in 15 jobs in the U.S. is airline related. Airline stocks are also recovering on plans to increase flights as the coronavirus pandemic fears abate.

13,Air Canada: #1 Stock to Watch Now - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Air Canada: #1 Stock to Watch Now. Airline stocks drag down the,"      Debra Ray | June 21, 2020 | More on: AC Airline stocks like Air Canada (TSX:AC) have suffered particularly hard hits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions like 14-day mandatory quarantines have made it increasingly difficult for people to travel. Further, airlines have been forced to relax refund policies in light of the dangers associated with travelling. We don’t know how quickly Air Canada stock will rebound. The world is just barely coming out of the initial thick of the COVID-19 health crisis. Moreover, as many jurisdictions relax social-distancing policies, a resurgence in infection rates continues to weigh on the Toronto Stock Exchange. For the moment, Canadian investors should keep airlines on their watch list. Brave investors who can handle a little risk in their portfolio could buy the stock with plans to hold for at least one year. For everyone else: your TFSA and RRSP can wait to benefit from owning shares of stock in the airline industry. In the past 12 months, the S&P/TSX Composite Index fell by 5.37%. Airlines are the biggest culprit dragging down the index. During the same period, Air Canada stock declined by a whopping 52.58%.  Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Air Canada stock was outperforming the index up until the travel restrictions tanked airline profits. Now, Air Canada stock is trading for less than $20 per share. Many long-term investors see this as an opportunity to buy the dip in airline stocks. However, many knowledgeable individuals also see the COVID-19 crisis and accompanying restrictions as more or less permanent features of the society in the foreseeable future. If they are right, you might want to move your hand away from the “buy” button. The primary issue with travel restrictions is the drain on free cash flow. Even as airplanes cut costs by laying off staff, these firms must accept losses on partially booked routes.

15,"American Airlines Is Planning $1.5 Billion Stock, Convertible Sale",. . . . . . . . . . . . . BloombergQuint. American Air Braces Balance Sheet With,"(Bloomberg) -- American Airlines Group Inc. dropped after the carrier said it would raise $3.5 billion in new financing, diverging from its recent reliance on federal aid as the coronavirus pandemic suppresses travel demand. The carrier is selling $750 million of shares and the same amount of senior convertible notes due in 2025, American said in a statement Sunday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. In addition, the carrier will offer $1.5 billion in senior secured notes and said it would enter into a $500 million term loan facility. American’s actions show the broad range of tools airlines are using to bolster balance sheets amid a hesitant return to flying that for now is led largely by leisure travelers anxious to escape months of confinement. While carriers have resumed some of the domestic flights slashed when the virus hurt travel demand in late March, a full recovery is expected to take years. The largest U.S. carriers continue to burn through as much as $45 million daily as demand sags.
