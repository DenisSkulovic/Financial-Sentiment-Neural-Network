0,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. Apple sounds the alarm on new COVID-19 cases and the sector goes tumbling down..,"   Airline investors remain skittish, worried that a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic could wipe out the gains the sector has made since early April and send travel demand numbers tumbling again. The stocks sold off on Friday afternoon after Apple provided fresh reason for concern about the spread of the outbreak. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) were down 7.5% as of 2 p.m. EDT, while shares of Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT), Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were all down more than 5%. The entire industry was under pressure, with shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), and Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) all down 4%. Airline stocks are well off their COVID-19 lows, encouraged by airline efforts to rebuild parts of their schedules for late summer travel. The industry has raised tens of billions in new funding to help survive the pandemic, but need travel demand, and with it revenue, to rebound in the quarters to come to avoid liquidity issues. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The stocks in recent weeks have traded up or down along with broader market sentiment about how soon the pandemic will be behind us, or whether there will be a second wave. On Friday Apple sounded the alarm about growing case numbers in key states, causing investors to head for the exits. Apple said it would temporarily shut down retail locations in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, and South Carolina due to a spike in new COVID-19 cases in those areas. Further closures are possible, as new cases are also on the rise in Texas and California among other states. The areas impacted are of particular significance to the airlines because for the most part cases are spiking in states that are popular domestic summer vacation destinations. The recent rebound in travel demand has been primarily for domestic leisure travel. If states like Florida have to shut down, a lot of those bookings are going to turn into cancellations. The airlines continue to brace for the worse. American is reportedly seeking to line up $2 billion in fresh funding via a junk bond sale. It seems increasingly likely the pandemic is going to be with us for a while. That's not good news for airline investors, and the stocks are trading off accordingly. The good news is the airlines are making steady","Jun 19, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/19/why-airline-shares-are-falling-today.aspx
1,Airlines Lead Losers as Stock Markets Limp Into the Weekend | The Motley Fool,Airlines Lead Losers as Stock Markets Limp Into the Weekend. The Dow and S&P edged lower as coronavirus fears amped,"   Market participants have been uncertain about what the next step for the stock market will be, and today, nervousness ended up winning the day. Despite solid economic data, investors are nervous about spikes in COVID-19 in some key areas of the country that haven't previously seen the worst of the outbreak. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) gave up early gains to finish lower on the day, the Nasdaq Composite once again defied the market and gained ground.

Airline stocks have been extremely volatile lately, and that trend continued today. Travel trends have started to look more favorable lately, but that could come to a sudden halt if new outbreaks cause would-be travelers to stay at home longer. Losses for the airline industry were felt across the board. Among major carriers, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) took the biggest decline, falling 6%. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) gave up 4%, while American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) were both down around 3%. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Smaller carriers saw similar-size losses. Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) finished lower by 5%, while Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) settled for a 4% drop and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) was down 3%. Airlines of all sizes are struggling with the same challenges. Although the major companies have greater international exposure that presents additional obstacles to overcome, the primary problem facing airlines is how to adapt their business models to deal with the new reality of health and safety consciousness while remaining profitable. Airlines have burned through billions of dollars covering expenses even as flight loads fell nearly to zero at times during the worst of the pandemic. And although traffic levels are recovering, most carriers still face significant negative cash flows. Most companies have already sought to raise capital from the financial markets, and government assistance has also been an option to help airlines maintain their labor forces and stay afloat. Yet the cash that airlines have already come up with might not be enough. American is looking to sell $2 billion in high-yield bonds, with the idea of raising even more capital to make sure that it has enough cash reserves to weather an extended period of sluggish performance or a second wave of","Jun 19, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/19/airlines-lead-losers-as-stock-markets-limp-into-th.aspx
2,Airline ETF Sees Liftoff on Stock Rebound | ETF Trends,Airline ETF Sees Liftoff on Stock Rebound. RELATED TOPICS. FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER. SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER!. CONNECT WITH,"The dramatic rebound of airline stocks in May and June has many analysts scratching their heads: is this too good to be true? Or are airlines a key indicator of a V-shaped recovery? On the upcoming webcast, Airline ETF Sees Liftoff on Stock Rebound, Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Global Investors, will consider the impact of COVID-19 on global airline stocks and the potential long-term benefits of entering the market during a recovery period. Investors can look to the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEArca: JETS), the lone ETF dedicated to airline stocks, to access the growing global airline industry. The ETF surged 34.8% over the past month, but it is still down 42.7% year-to-date. JETS follows the U.S. Global Jets Index, which uses fundamental screens to select airline companies, with an emphasis on domestic carriers, along with global aircraft manufacturers and airport companies. Many have turned to JETS as a way to bet on the broad recovery of the airline industry that has been among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic after global governments halted air travel in a bid to contain the outbreak. The play has also been a way for investors to bet against Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s chief executive, who sold major stakes in the four biggest U.S. carriers earlier this year. JETS has also become a popular way for many retail investors to gain diversified exposure to the airline industry as opposed to betting on single airliners. According to the Robinhood trading platform data, the number of JETS investors has increased to almost 28,000 from around 360 at the start of March. JETS saw significant inflows from deep-value investors and institutional investors like hedge funds as well. These inflows have accelerated as the outlook for an effective COVID-19 vaccine has become more promising, pushing airline stocks higher.

3,"Despite Management's Best Efforts, AAL Stock Is Still a Risky Name | InvestorPlace",American Airlines Is Again the Bearer of Bad News. Streamlined operations at its employees’ expense won't help AAL stock. More," At its current price of $16.49 per share, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock is still relatively close to its 52-week low of $8.25. Investors may be tempted to pick up AAL stock because of an assumed impending price bump as flights ramp up. But Main street investors like you and I first need to look at the company’s past history, liquidity, and valuation before that. In a beleaguered industry, facing overcapacity for some time to come, and as a laggard with a weak balance sheet, AAL stock is one of the last trades investors should be considering. Recent news only solidifies that notion. On May 27, American Airlines released a management note outlining their continuing priorities during the pandemic. Management listed adequate cash, a reduction of cash burn rate, and restoring confidence in air travel as the three goals. The thrust of the filing is that the company feels they have adequate liquidity. But in order to reduce expenses they will be reducing staff by 39,000 through voluntary leave and early retirement. The company is attempting to streamline operations to decrease daily cash burn. AAL will prioritize fleet optimization and restructured organizational teams. The company plans to fly 100 fewer planes by next summer and will be reducing and retiring mainly widebody planes from the fleet. The company’s current fleet is roughly an 80/20 percent mix of narrow body to widebody aircraft. And American currently maintains a total fleet of 871 planes. American Airline’s management is prioritizing restructuring and will prioritize future leaders and talent. Management and support staff is to be about 30% leaner moving forward to accommodate the reduction in operations. American stresses this decision is voluntary and that thereafter, involuntary separations will be announced in July. Needless to say, the company will have a battle on its hands in trying to incentivize workers to voluntarily quit in this employment environment. Those who American will “involuntarily separate” in July will have a union acting on their behalf. American Airlines stock will react as this plays out. I don’t expect it to be a boon to the share price. Management has also stated that it expects the company to have $11 billion  (page 44) in liquidity at the end of second quarter. American Airlines forecasts that their second quarter daily cash burn will average $70 million. Further, June average daily cash burn is expected to decrease to $50","Jun 19, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/06/aal-stock-again-bearer-of-bad-news/

(Also hi, I'm new)","I've been seriously loving Robinhood so far but I am relatively new to it and investing in general so I thought this would be a great place to brainstorm and hear your opinions. Recently I've noticed airline stocks just tanking (due to COVID) and I'm wondering why this isn't something I'm hearing about much? I'm assuming it will more than likely jump back once the pandemic is over right? I understand there is the risk of these companies permanently closing. But the odds seem pretty good to me.... With my limited knowledge of course. Curious what you all know about this. I'd love to pick your brain about it. Personally I'm gunna wait a bit and see how bad the covid hits. If it's not so bad I might buy more to average down if it tanks. But I still plan to hold most long term I jumped on deltas and my overall has already went up. This. Jumped on Delta and made $75 the next day just off of them. If you're going to invest in the airline industry, just be aware of the potential risks the companies have. Its possible a major airline may go bankrupt due to the pandemic. I would do your DD and look at which company has the best balance sheet in your opinion. Personally, I am investing in the JETS ETF. It invests in the major domestic airlines and aerospace manufacturers, az well as a few international airlines. Other than that, I would go with Delta (DAL) or Southwest (LUV). I have also invested in JETS ETF - in these extremely uncertain times this looks like the best long term.

Trust Air,"      Ryan Vanzo | June 19, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) investors are nervous. And they should be. The airline industry has never experienced a challenge like COVID-19. Yet there’s also room for optimism. In normal conditions, this is a phenomenal stock. From 2012 to 2019, share rose by 2,000%. If the global situation stabilizes, this company could be back to business as usual, likely leading to big gains for shareholders. Investing in Air Canada today is a direct bet that the COVID-19 crisis won’t persist for years. Dozens of epidemiologists have weighed in on the situation, but we also have new predictions from company executives. If you own stock in any airline, pay close attention to what this management team has to say. There’s no doubt that 2020 will be challenging for airlines. Most operators have slashed annual capacity by at least 80%. “The past quarter was the first in 27 consecutive quarters that we did not report year-over-year operating revenue growth,” revealed CEO Calin Rovinescu. “We are now living through the darkest period ever in the history of commercial aviation.” Thus far, at least, there haven’t been any major bankruptcies thanks to last-ditch fundraising efforts. Last week, Air Canada shored-up its financial position with a $1.6 billion capital raise. The financing included both debt and share issuance. CFO Michael Rousseau stressed that travel restrictions and the associated pandemic “destroyed demand and depleted cash.” The company lost more than $1 billion last quarter alone. To put that into perspective, the current market cap is just $4.9 billion. While the latest cash raise is encouraging, the fact remains that the company can’t survive many more quarters like this. Exactly how long will current conditions persist? Air Canada’s CEO weighed in on the last conference call. “It is our current expectation that it will take at least three years to recover to 2019 levels of revenue and capacity,” warned Rovinescu. “We expect that both the overall industry and our airline will be considerably smaller for some time, which will unfortunately result in significant reductions in both fleet and employee levels.” If we assume that airline executives know their business best, it’s going to be an extraordinarily difficult few years. It’s hard to overstate how challenging it will be. These companies are cash intensive, with high fixed costs.

Here’s,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Paul Summers | Saturday, 20th June, 2020 | More on: EZJ ISF It seems fair to say that 2020 has been a year budget airline easyJet (LSE: EZJ) will want to forget. As if the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent grounding of flights weren’t bad enough for business, the company was also recently forced to announce that millions of customer details were hacked back in January.  Despite all this, those buying the stock back when markets crashed in March will have done very well. Indeed, easyJet’s share price was flying a little over 60% higher yesterday than where it was in mid-March. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Are the shares are still worth buying? Not in my view. The arguments against buying now are both plentiful and powerful. First, investor expectations may be unreasonably high. Even if the company manages to get more planes in the air, you’d need to be a real optimist to think that things will return to how they used to be anytime soon. Ask your nearest and dearest whether they’d be happy to fly tomorrow. I’ll bet the majority won’t, even if middle seats were kept free. Also consider the increased costs associated with keeping planes clean and the need to offer big discounts to attract flyers in an already highly competitive industry. All this surely has implications for profits and, ultimately, the share price. Will those who’ve recently made a packet be willing to stick around? I’m not so sure, especially as we become more aware of the full economic impact of the pandemic. Even Warren Buffett, arguably the greatest proponent of buy-and-hold investing, dumped all his airline stocks not that long ago. Another thing worth considering is that a not-insignificant portion of easyJet’s shares are being shorted. In other words, a fair number of market participants are now betting the share will fall.

","By JOHN PERSINOS • June 19, 2020 • STOCKS TO WATCH The coronavirus pandemic has badly battered the airline industry. The major air carriers have lost billions and it will be many months, perhaps years, before they return to profitability. How dismal are prospects for the airlines? Warren Buffett has turned his back on the industry. That’s a bearish indicator if I’ve ever seen one. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A, BRK.B) revealed in its first-quarter earnings report that it dumped all of its shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), American (NSDQ: AAL), Southwest (NYSE: LUV), and United (NSDQ: UAL). Berkshire had an 11% stake of Delta, 10% of American, 10% of Southwest, and 9% of United. The amount of stock sold totaled $6.1 billion. Berkshire took a big loss, the amount of which it hasn’t disclosed. The dire straits of airlines and their related industries, due to the pandemic’s destruction of passenger demand, prompted me this week to interview an analyst who’s widely considered to be the foremost expert on the aviation sector: Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the aerospace/defense consultancy Teal Group. He’s pictured to your left.  I specialize in the aerospace/defense sector. [Full disclosure: I occasionally work as an analyst for Teal, which is based in Fairfax, Virginia.] Richard has been a friend and colleague for more than 30 years. As a consultant, Richard usually charges corporate CEOs and Wall Street bigwigs thousands of dollars for just an hour of his time. This week, I bought Richard’s expertise for a beer and a hamburger on my patio. Let’s see what Richard has to say about airlines and the aerospace/defense sector as a whole, and what it all means for investors. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the airline industry on average is losing $350 million to $400 million per day. It’s a tough question to ask, especially as we witness a second wave of coronavirus cases, but how long do you think it will take before the industry returns to normal, if ever? I’m kind of a vaccine fundamentalist here. Assuming we get one within 18 months, traffic should recover to 2019 peak levels by late 2023. It’s possible that an effective post-infection remedy drug will help the angle of the “Nike Swoosh” recovery we seem to be starting, but that still isn’t the same as getting back to where we were.
