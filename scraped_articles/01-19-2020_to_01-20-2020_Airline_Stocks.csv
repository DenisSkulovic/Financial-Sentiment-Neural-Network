0,"Why Southwest Airlines Remains a Buy, Despite Boeing Woes | The Motley Fool","Why Southwest Airlines Remains a Buy, Despite Boeing Woes. How Southwest is faring in the face of ongoing MAX groundings..","   Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) posted a record financial performance in Q3 2019 -- perfect timing for a decade that boosted shares of Southwest up 372%, about double the S&P 500. Southwest will report Q4 2019 earnings on Jan. 23, along with competitors American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, and Alaska Air Group. Here's a look at Southwest's 2019 performance and what to expect from this quarter and the years ahead.  LUV DATA BY YCHARTS Southwest has a history of financial strength and a reputation for a rock-solid balance sheet. Southwest's fundamentals, consistent performance, and low P/E ratio that is about half of the S&P 500 make it a premier value stock. Despite droves of airline bankruptcies in the early and mid-2000s, including United Airlines and Delta Air Lines,followed by American Airlines in 2011, Southwest has remained profitable for 46 consecutive years.  LUV NET TOTAL LONG TERM DEBT (ANNUAL) DATA BY YCHARTS Regarded as a fun-loving airline dedicated to its people, Southwest is also the only company out of the six major U.S. airlines to have negative net total long-term debt. As a result of its capital discipline, Southwest also has the lowest Price to Free Cash Flow (FCF) of the six major airlines, with a market capitalization that is just 10.6 times FCF. Free cash flow is a means to fund growth outside of typical operations, such as returning cash to shareholders in the form of a dividend or buying back stock. Although not an elite dividend stock, Southwest yields 1.3% and raised its dividend 200% over the past five years. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Southwest's record quarter was achieved despite the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes which have cost Southwest an estimated $435 million  as of Sept. 30, 2019. Boeing, like many airlines, expected the groundings to cease before 2019 year-end, but the planes remain out of service. The delays have forced airlines to prepare for the worst. American Airlines has delayed service of its Boeing 737 MAX fleet until April 7, 2020, Southwest until mid-April, and United until June 4, 2020, costing billions for Boeing and hundreds of millions for these airlines.   Southwest's record quarter despite the MAX delays is impressive when you consider the airline can't fly its 34 MAX planes. Southwest was originally expecting 113 737s by year-end 2020, but that forecast will probably go down the longer the","Jan 19, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/19/why-southwest-airlines-remains-a-buy-despite-boein.aspx
1,Spirit Airlines Is on Track for Another Better-Than-Feared Quarter | The Motley Fool,"Spirit Airlines Is on Track for Another Better-Than-Feared Quarter. The budget carrier's profit margin is still falling, but the margin","   Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) entered last year with a ton of momentum. The budget airline generated incredible unit revenue growth in the second half of 2018, powering a return to margin expansion. Falling fuel prices represented an additional tailwind during 2019. Unfortunately, this momentum didn't last, as operational snafus and choppy demand undermined Spirit's profitability beginning in the spring. Back in October, Spirit Airlines reported that adjusted earnings per share fell to $1.32 in Q3 2019 from $1.47 a year earlier. Its adjusted pre-tax margin sank to 11.9% from 14.5% in the prior-year period, despite a sharp drop in fuel prices. Still, this result was better than management (and, by extension, investors) had feared. Spirit's initial guidance for the fourth quarter was also downbeat. But based on an investor update released on Thursday, it appears that the airline's results will come in better than feared for a second consecutive quarter. Spirit Airlines' revenue per available seat mile (RASM) fell 1.7% in the third quarter, and the carrier's October forecast called for a 4.5% to 6.5% decline in Q4. Normally, a decline of this magnitude would be shocking, but it wasn't too surprising in this case. After all, management had already reported weak off-peak demand and the carrier faced an extremely tough year-over-year comparison after posting an 11.4% surge in RASM in Q4 2018. IMAGE SOURCE: SPIRIT AIRLINES. Management also projected that nonfuel unit costs would rise 3.5% to 4.5%, offsetting the airline's fuel savings. All in all, the midpoint of Spirit's original Q4 forecast implied adjusted EPS around $0.99, down from $1.38 a year ago. In its recent guidance update, Spirit Airlines said that RASM fell 3.6% last quarter (or 4.3% excluding a one-time revenue adjustment). This was a solid result considering the tough comparison. Additionally, the carrier grew its capacity 16.6% year over year -- slightly more than planned -- so total revenue grew more than 12%, reaching approximately $970 million. In other good news, adjusted nonfuel unit costs increased 3.3%, slightly below the low end of the initial forecast. There were also some other minor tweaks to Spirit's outlook, but they weren't material. Taking all aspects of the new guidance into account, Spirit Airlines seems likely to report Q4 adjusted EPS in the vicinity of $1.24. While that would still represent a 10% year-over-year decline, it's a far cry from the 28% EPS plunge implied by","Jan 20, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/20/spirit-airlines-is-on-track-for-another-better-tha.aspx
2,Forum: How the airline industry made inequality worse - StarTribune.com,StarTribune. . Forum: How the airline industry made inequality worse. Asia Today: Sydney outbreak grows; Thailand sees big jump. The,"With power and wealth concentration on the minds of politicians and voters in an election year, one overlooked culprit is the airline industry. Thanks in part to the deregulation and consolidation of the industry during the past several decades, airlines have focused their operations in big hub airports and major coastal markets as a way of reducing excess capacity and improving their profitability. And for a long time, airlines needed the government’s help in staying afloat. But today, the airline industry is the most profitable it has ever been. Increasing flight connections to second-tier cities would help reduce geographic inequality by creating better links with the thriving superstar cities. If airlines won’t do it on their own, perhaps government should intervene. It’s understandable why regulators let the airline industry restructure so extensively. Historically, airlines have been a sinkhole for money. Warren Buffett’s famous joke about the industry is that investors could have saved billions of dollars if someone had shot down the Wright brothers’ plane. The industry struggled in the 1970s and 1980s amid high fuel costs, and the 2000s were simply disastrous between the downturn in travel after the 9/11 terrorist attacks at the start of the decade and the Great Recession at the end of it. U.S. airlines had losses of more than $50 billion during the decade. With the industry on the brink of collapse, regulators allowed it to consolidate from 10 major carriers to four. Delta and Northwest Airlines both declared bankruptcy and merged, joining other carriers that were operating in bankruptcy. Along the way airlines rewrote labor contracts, eliminated some unprofitable routes and slashed debt. The reduction in competition and cost-cutting just as the economy rebounded from the Great Recession allowed airlines to finally earn their keep and reward investors. But a convergence of other factors also helped. Interest rates remained near record lows during the past decade, letting airlines both pay down their debt and cut servicing costs on their remaining obligations. The job market remained relatively weak, giving airlines breathing room on labor costs. And then in 2014 oil prices collapsed, in part because of the growth of domestic oil production, giving airlines cheap and stable fuel costs in a way that they had rarely enjoyed in the past. All of a sudden, an industry known for losing money in good times and bad was reaping profits like never before.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON (Reuters) - A subsidiary of Airbus <AIR.PA>, the world’s largest planemaker, is preparing to launch a financial product aimed at helping its airline customers hedge against risks to revenue, officials said. Skytra Ltd, a fully-owned subsidiary, plans to launch listed financial futures and options on exchanges this year that will represent airlines revenue and help the industry manage risks more efficiently. Airlines typically hedge their fuel costs and foreign exchange exposures but the Skytra exchange is the first of its kind for the industry. While airline infrastructure and operational commitments are planned years into the future, the majority of airline tickets are sold in the five weeks before take-off, according to a statement from Skytra. Even those airline ticket prices are subject to constant change due to external factors including supply or demand surges, political issues, or tax and economic uncertainty. But with no existing financial instrument to manage air travel revenue volatility effectively despite a fixed cost base, airlines remain financially vulnerable which Skytra’s product offering aims to address. The London-based firm has developed a suite of global and regional indices that will track the daily changes in the price of air travel in each geographic market, based on an industry measure of demand called revenue per passenger kilometer (RPK) which measures the number of kilometers traveled by paying passengers. “Finally we will have a risk management instrument tailor-made for the air travel industry that will help us manage our exposure to ticket price volatility more efficiently,” said Christine Rovelli, head of treasury at Finnair <FIA1S.HE>. Skytra aims to launch indices for six of the most active geographic sectors and roll them out to other sectors gradually, executives at the firm said. The product will be similar to typical futures contracts traded on most exchanges with quarterly expiries and offering contracts of up to two years.

5,"'Boring' economy spells winning year for stocks, Barclays' Mike Gapen","A ‘boring’ economy is setting stocks up for a winning year, Barclays top economist says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News","Top Wall Street economist Michael Gapen believes the market’s record rally has stamina. The Barclays head of U.S. economics research cites a calm economic backdrop as a major driver. “We’re kind of sitting at a trend-like outlook where growth is around 2% this year,” he told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “It’s a very benign outlook. In some ways, it’s boring. I kind of think a boring U.S. outlook is actually pretty good for risk assets.” Gapen’s enthusiasm is chiefly due to a reduction in risk factors stemming from the signing of the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal and the positive impact the U.K. election will likely have on Brexit. But there’s one more vital ingredient keeping stocks in record high territory: Monetary policy. Gapen thinks it’s virtually impossible the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this year. “The key is the Fed is on the sideline,” he said. “With the Fed committed to being on the sideline, I think that’s what’s helping equity markets move higher.” With just 12 trading days in the books for 2020, the Dow and S&P 500 are up 3% this year. So far this year, the Dow has seen seven all-time highs while the S&P has seen nine. Overall, Gapen predicts the market will hold on to record gains and have another winning year. “Our steady-ish as she goes trend-like outlook would be consistent, with say, equity market performance of around 8% to 9% this year given where we expect earnings growth to be,” Gapen said.

The World Health Organization called a meeting for Wednesday to consider declaring a global health emergency while authorities in China confirmed the coronavirus could spread through human contact. The mayor of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, confirmed a sixth virus-related death and the United States reported its first case. Investors worried about the threat of contagion as hundreds of millions travel for the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays, which peak over the coming weekend. Traders recalled the fallout from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003 that killed about 800 people and which China initially covered up. Emerging market stocks lost 1.74%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.63% lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.91%. Hong Kong, where the economy suffered broadly due to the SARS outbreak, saw its main stock index fall 2.8%, the most for any day in over five months. The overnight chill in Asia carried over to European markets. Shares of luxury goods makers - which have large exposure to China - were among those declining the most. A U.S. index of airline stocks fell 2.6%. Hotel and casino operators Las Vegas Sands Corp and Wynn Resorts Ltd, both of which have large operations in China, dropped over 5%. “The fear is this could mushroom into an epidemic that could cut into economic activity,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “If it turns into an epidemic, who’s going to fly?” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 152.06 points, or 0.52 percent, to 29,196.04, the S&P 500 lost 8.83 points, or 0.27 percent, to 3,320.79 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.14 points, or 0.19 percent, to 9,370.81. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.16 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.45 percent.

8,Canadian airlines feel the pressure of flight-shaming and the 'Greta effect' - BNN Bloomberg,. BNN. COMPANY NEWS. . COMPANY NEWS. Canadian airlines feel the pressure of flight-shaming and the 'Greta effect'. . Top,"  MORE  Latest Videos  Most Popular Content Jan 20, 2020  Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press MONTREAL - Swedish may not be the lingua franca of the aviation world, but ask any airline executive about the term “flygskam” and they'll likely know exactly what it means. Flygskam - Swedish for “flight shame” - is a growing environmental movement that highlights the flight sector's carbon footprint, putting pressure on Canadian carriers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while managing the cost of passenger guilt. “It does seem like a switch has flipped,” says airline expert Seth Kaplan. “For a while, there was this very incremental recognition of the urgency (of climate change), and then over the past year or so all this has really gotten into the spotlight - aided by Greta Thunberg.” The Swedish teenage activist, who travelled by racing yacht to a climate summit in New York to avoid flying and its attendant emissions, has focused attention on aviation's role in global warming, with consequences for travel companies. The CEO of SAS, one of Scandinavia's largest carriers, has attributed declining passenger numbers in Sweden to flight shaming. Meanwhile the country's main train operator, SJ, said it sold 1.5 million more tickets in 2018 than the previous year, thanks to what's been dubbed the “Greta effect.” Other European countries are experiencing the same phenomenon. Germany saw a similar decline in domestic flights in 2018, along with a corresponding increase in rail travel. To combat this trend, airlines are turning to carbon offsets, where they invest in projects such as wind farms and tree planting to compensate for plane-produced carbon dioxide. Such measures could cost airlines billions, Citigroup Inc. said in a research note last October. The banking conglomerate forecasts that carbon offsetting economy-class flights will cost US$3.8 billion per year within five years. Carriers could absorb the expense or pass it along to consumers via a higher ticket price, but airlines will struggle in the long run if increased costs deter travellers from flying, Citi said. If airlines foot the bill themselves, “the cost of carbon offsetting all leisure consumption could be as much as 27 per cent of airlines' profits by 2025,” wrote analyst Mark Manduca. Offsetting corporate travel - which Citi defined as business-class seats - will cost another $2.4 billion, reducing airline profits by a further 17 per cent, the report said.

Airbus plans derivatives exchange to temper,"Leaving your flight booking until the last minute can take a big chunk out of your wallet. Airlines don’t like it, either. Now, the world’s biggest plane maker has come up with a solution. Airbus AIR, -1.53%, the European aerospace and defense company that competes against U.S.-based Boeing BA, -0.67%, has launched the first-ever trading venue for derivatives designed to help its airline customers hedge against highly volatile ticket prices. Skytra, a subsidiary of Netherlands-based Airbus, will offer futures and options contracts based on newly developed indexes that track live price changes in air travel across the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific. Shares in Airbus were slightly up at almost €138 at 11:30 GMT. The launch of the trading venture comes as many airlines’ share prices have been rocked by scandals such as the one surrounding the Boeing 737 Max, which has been grounded since March last year following two crashes in the space of a few months. Flight bookings have also been hit by uncertainty over the U.K.’s imminent departure from the European Union. The air-travel business uses derivatives to hedge against the risk of adverse changes in borrowing costs, fuel expenses and foreign-exchange rates. But airlines don’t have the ability to hedge against changing ticket prices, which can move dramatically in response to supply-and-demand surges, political issues, economic uncertainty and weather. One of the biggest examples of this in recent years was when the Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted in Iceland, disrupting travel plans for hundreds of thousands of passengers across Europe. Airbus’s new product would help reduce the cost of such events by protecting against fluctuations in supply and demand for tickets. The majority of airline tickets are sold in the last five weeks before takeoff, which can cause uncertainty for carriers. The launch of Skytra comes as the number of flights taken annually is expected to double in the next 15 years from 4 billion to 8 billion, according to the International Air Transport Association. “Finally we will have a risk-management instrument tailor-made for the air-travel industry that will help us manage our exposure to ticket-price volatility more efficiently,” said Christine Rovelli, head of treasury at Finnish airline Finnair FIA1S, -2.20%.

Days after announcing it reached an agreement to acquire regional carrier TwoFlex, its CEO, John Rodgerson, announced the airline increased its Embraer E195-E2 order from 51 to 75 aircraft. The news was announced by Azul’s CEO, John Rodgerson, upon a meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, and the information was reported by O Estado de São Paulo newspaper. Azul has not officially informed the market of the order increase. The airline currently operates four units of the next-generation Embraer — the first was received in September 2019 — and expects to have 20 by the end of this year, as per the last official forecast. Azul’s strategy is to aggressively phase-out its old Embraer 190/195-E1s replacing them with the E2s, which have a cost per seat around 26 percent lower. Although there was no official announcement by the airline, investors received the news with optimism. Azul’s stock at São Paulo’s BVMF increased 3.21 percent the day following the news, while the airline stocks at the NYSE grew a solid 3.99 percent. The day before, Azul had made another big announcement; it will start flights to New York/JFK Airport. There will be daily operations operated by the Airbus A330-200 from the airline’s hub in Campinas. This will be the first U.S. destination of the airline outside Florida, starting on June 15. “New York is the Brazilians’ apple of their eyes”, stated John Rodgerson in a press release. “With this announcement, we write another historic page in the recent trajectory of Azul. Campinas and all our domestic network, from Porto Alegre to Mossoró, will gain with the launch of this new international destination. We are very happy and excited with this new operation,” said the CEO. Such flight was long-awaited. Upon the launch of Azul’s long-haul services in 2014, New York was one of the three outlined destinations, along with Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. Since then, both Florida cities have daily flights of the airline, but New York was put on a hold given the strong recession Brazil entered into. Another factor that pushed the flight forward was the Brazilian real devaluation, which contained tourists from travelling abroad.

The safety rating depends on IATA operational safety,"Airline safety is perhaps among the things flyers hope they don’t have to think about when they board an aircraft. And if the airline is among the following, which have been rated the safest low-cost airlines globally, even the ones who are scared of flying can take a deep breath. According to airline safety and product review portal AirlineRatings.com, India’s IndiGo is the world’s safest low-cost carrier for 2020 after Air Arabia (UAE), Flybe (UK), Frontier (US), and HK Express (Hong Kong). The other five in the list are JetBlue (US), Volaris (Mexico), Vueling (Spain), Westjet (Canada), and Wizz (Hungary). The annual rating of airlines is based on a range of factors including “audits from aviation’s governing and industry bodies, government audits, airline’s crash and serious incident record, profitability, industry-leading safety initiatives, and fleet age,” according to the portal. IndiGo is given seven out of seven-star safety rating and four out of five-star product rating. IndiGo — India’s largest airline has over 250 planes in its kitty and has a market share of over 47 per cent. DGCA has given the carrier more time to replace the Pratt & Whitney engines fitted to its Airbus A320neo planes which have been linked to in-flight engine shutdowns, PTI reported citing a statement by DGCA. The watchdog had asked the airline in November to replace the engines by January 31 after four incidents of in-flight engine shutdowns within a week caused “serious concern”. Also read: Air India unions to demand voluntary retirement scheme in Monday meeting The safety rating depends on IATA operational safety audit certification, not blacklisted by European Union, maintaining fatality-free record for the past 10 years, the US Federal Aviation Authority’s endorsement, meeting eight safety parameters by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and whether it has been grounded by the respective country’s aviation authority for safety issues.

Health authorities in many areas have been on high","   A widening outbreak of a mysterious pneumonia-like virus helped propel shares of some Chinese drugmakers to multiyear highs, while travel stocks fell, as investors made bets on the potential economic impact of the disease in the region. Shares of a Hong Kong-listed company that makes a generic version of the antiviral drug Tamiflu jumped 19.4% to a record closing high. The firm, YiChang HEC Changjiang Pharmaceutical Co. , is China’s dominant producer of the drug known as oseltamivir, which can help quickly alleviate flu symptoms in patients. In Shanghai, shares of Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies Co. , a company that develops influenza virus kits and rapid test kits, rallied 20% to the maximum level allowed on the exchange’s six-month-old Science and Technology Innovation Board. Several other Chinese pharmaceutical stocks jumped about 10% on the main Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses. Chinese health authorities said Monday the number of patients infected with a recently discovered strain of coronavirus jumped to 198, up significantly from a total of 62 reported a day earlier. The virus, which was first identified among individuals who were sickened in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has so far killed three people and spread to more population centers within the country, including Beijing. The news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.  Outside mainland China, there have been suspected cases of people with the coronavirus in cities including Hong Kong and Singapore, but only a few confirmed cases in Thailand, South Korea and Japan. Health authorities in many areas have also been on high alert, especially with increased travel around the Lunar New Year holiday this month. Cyrus Ng, a health-care analyst at Jefferies Hong Kong, said speculative buying was behind much of the drugmakers’ rally Monday, but a severe outbreak of the virus may lead to greater demand for drugs and related products. Even stocks of some Chinese makers of surgical masks jumped about 10% in Shanghai. Shares of Chinese airlines, tour and hotel operators, on the other hand, sank Monday on the possibility that people could cut back on travel in the region if the viral outbreak worsens significantly.

PHOTO","8 P/SUNNY  JIJI With Sunday marking the 10th anniversary of Japan Airlines’ bankruptcy — the largest nonfinancial business failure in the nation up to that point — questions and criticisms remain over the generous state assistance provided to the company to help it dig itself out of from under debts totalling some ¥2.3 trillion. “We caused trouble to many parties concerned, including our shareholders, related government agencies and ministries, as well as partner financial institutions,” JAL President Yuji Akasaka said in an interview.   “There are many people who are still suffering … and we never think that we have restored trust 100 percent,” he said. “By contributing to society through our businesses and developing continuously, we hope to recover trust.” Japan Airlines achieved a swift recovery thanks to the public funds, job cuts and management reform launched under the leadership of Kazuo Inamori, the founder of Kyocera Corp., who was brought in at the time to turn the company around. But before the bankruptcy, poor business results were the norm at JAL, which had many issues such as a fleet of large aircraft with poor fuel efficiency and high pension payments to retirees. The government at the time was led by the now-defunct Democratic Party of Japan. The then-administration decided to employ the government-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of Japan to carry out drastic reforms at the airline. After making arrangements to prevent the bankruptcy from causing flight service suspensions, the government compelled JAL file for legal liquidation. Public funds totaling ¥350 billion were injected through the turnaround body, and JAL’s creditor banks agreed to write off debts totalling about ¥521.5 billion. Individual shareholders also suffered due to JAL’s delisting from the stock exchange and a 100 percent reduction in JAL’s capital. Inamori, who became JAL’s chairman at the request of the DPJ-led government, changed the company’s corporate culture by introducing such measures as the “amoeba” management system, in which each division, or amoeba, pursued its own profits. “Before the bankruptcy, our management and workers lacked cost awareness and responsibility,” Akasaka said. “This changed immensely thanks to the leadership of (then-)Chairman Inamori,” he said. By cutting 16,000 jobs, including through dismissals, JAL posted a consolidated operating profit of ¥204.9 billion for the year to March 2012. The company was returned to first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in September of that year.

16,Jet Airways: Meet The South American Investor  Eyeing The Beleaguered Airline | Synergy Group,. . . . . . . . . . . . . BloombergQuint. Synergy Group: The South American Investor,"Lenders to Jet Airways Ltd. have some hope again. On Jan. 15, the airline, currently undergoing insolvency proceedings, received an expression of interest from two prospective bidders—South American investor Synergy Group and New Delhi-based Prudent Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd. While the interest from Prudent Asset Reconstruction is recent, the Synergy Group has flirted with the idea of bidding for Jet Airways for a few months now. In October 2019, when the first round of bidding was coming to a close, Synergy Group had expressed an interest and sought more time from the lenders to submit a firm bid. The lenders extended the deadline by a month. However, Synergy Group was still not ready with a bid, as it sought clarity on the redistribution of airport slots, which had been taken away from Jet Airways in April 2019, when it stopped flying. On Jan. 6, Synergy Group submitted a second EoI for Jet Airways, suggesting that it is seriously considering a bid for the insolvent airline. Lenders are hoping that in the current round, Synergy Group actually submits a full resolution plan, said a banker involved in the process, while speaking on condition of anonymity. While the bidder has held discussions with the creditors and their advisers, it is yet to put money on the table, this person said. The group is looking to buy 49 percent stake in Jet Airways and may have to tie up with a local partner to run Jet Airways, the banker quoted earlier said. Synergy Group did not respond to queries emailed on Thursday. The Synergy Group is no stranger to the airline sector. Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the group operates a number of airlines in South America. It is a well-known airline investor, said Mark Martin, founder and chief executive officer at Martin Consulting. “Synergy Group is one of the world’s most stable airline investors. The Indian aviation business has a large presence of airlines from the Middle East. American, Latin American and South East Asian airlines have been trying to get a foot into the Indian market for over 20 years,” said Martin. In 2004, the group’s Chairman and Founder German Efromovich bought controlling stake in Latin America’s airline holding company—Avianca Holdings, which is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It reported an operating profit of $100.3 million for the quarter ended September 2019.
