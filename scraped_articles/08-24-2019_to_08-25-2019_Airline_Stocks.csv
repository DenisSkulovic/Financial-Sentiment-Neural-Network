1,Can Delta Repeat Its Seattle Success in Boston? | The Motley Fool,"Can Delta Repeat Its Seattle Success in Boston?. Since 2014, Delta has successfully built a new West Coast hub in","   As recently as late 2013, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) operated just 35 daily departures at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac). However, it began growing rapidly there in early 2014 -- challenging hometown carrier Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) -- and named Seattle as a new hub in June of that year. By this summer, Delta had roughly quintupled its flight schedule at Sea-Tac, operating 174 peak-day departures. Delta is looking to repeat that success in Boston, which officially became its newest hub city earlier this year. This time, it's taking on JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), which has been the market leader in Boston since 2010. Yet the market dynamics in Boston could end up being quite different than in Seattle. Let's see what that may mean for Delta. Delta Air Lines began its growth in Boston a few years ago. By the end of 2018, the carrier and its joint-venture partners were offering more than 120 daily departures there. As was the case in Seattle, Delta started with an unusually high number of international routes for a non-hub market and has gradually grown its domestic-route network to attract business travelers, enable more connecting itineraries, and support further international growth. However, gate constraints have impeded Delta's expansion in Boston recently. Those gate constraints are about to ease, though. On Aug. 29, Southwest Airlines will move its operations in Boston to Terminal B, giving Delta control of all 21 gates in Terminal A. This will allow Delta to launch new routes to three key domestic business markets -- Chicago, Newark, and Washington, D.C. -- next month. New service to Miami will start in December. These new routes will give Delta and its partners more than 150 peak-day departures in Boston. That number could grow to 200 by 2021, according to company president Glen Hauenstein. DELTA WILL RESUME ITS GROWTH IN BOSTON NEXT MONTH. IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. So far, Boston appears to be a great market for Delta Air Lines. The carrier's revenue in Boston surged more than 25% last quarter on a stellar 10% increase in unit revenue. In some ways, Delta could have an easier time becoming the preferred airline in Boston than in Seattle. Alaska Airlines operates more than 300 daily departures at Sea-Tac, ranging from short-haul turboprop service to transcontinental flights. Despite Delta's growth there, Alaska still has slightly more than 50% market share on domestic routes in","Aug 24, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/24/can-delta-repeat-its-seattle-success-in-boston.aspx

Presidents Trump and Xi are raising the stakes even further this weekend after a traumatic Friday for the stock market. On Friday, China announced $75 billion in additional tariffs on American goods. Trump reacted by calling Xi an “enemy” and announcing further tariff increases of his own. He also ordered American companies to relocate their operations outside of China. As a result, the Dow plunged 623 points. And it could get even worse next week. Late Friday evening, Trump again took to Twitter, this time threatening to invoke a national emergency to crack down on China: For all of the Fake News Reporters that don’t have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers, China, etc., try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.

By CCN.com: Facebook (FB) stock suffered a devastating 2018 amidst controversies that led to a mass investor exodus. In one particularly painful trading session, Facebook rewrote the history books with a $126 billion plunge. The social media giant weathered the storm, and FB shares are up almost 38 percent this year amid a broad stock market recovery. And as major stock indices succumb to trade war panic, Facebook is poised to offer investors massive upside. FB stock’s technical picture suggests that the company could be on the verge of rallying more than 25 percent, a move that would enable it to set a new all-time high. A look at the weekly chart reveals that FB shares have been trading within a large ascending channel for over seven years. The support of the channel was briefly broken in October 2018, which ignited a waterfall event that drove the equity to as low as $123.02 in December 2018. However, the move below the support of the channel appears to be a deviation. Bulls bought the dip and lifted the stock back above the diagonal support in January 2019. The recovery of the support catapulted Facebook to a 2019 high of $208.66. The stock is currently correcting, but it is still inside the ascending channel. Thus, as long as it trades within the structure, we can see Facebook tapping the resistance of the channel at $225.

Toxic tactics by Ryanair crashed our shares, say investors suing airline for staff strife and walkout by pilots. RELATED","By WILLIAM TURVILL FOR THE FINANCIAL MAIL ON SUNDAY PUBLISHED: 22:31 GMT, 24 August 2019 | UPDATED: 22:31 GMT, 24 August 2019  16 View
comments  High-spirited: Chief executive Michael O'Leary has been strongly defended by Ryanair Angry Ryanair investors have launched legal action over allegations the airline’s ‘toxic’ relationship with its workforce has crashed the share price. The shareholders claim they were misled in statements about the firm’s industrial relations, said to have been ‘excellent’ by chief executive Michael O’Leary. They allege that Ryanair’s worker policies led to recent strikes, which have dented the company’s profits and contributed to a collapse in the value of their shares.  The airline has been plagued by a series of walkouts in recent years, most notably last summer, leading to hundreds of flights being disrupted or cancelled. It managed to avert any cancellations last week despite some pilots backing a 48-hour strike. Ryanair’s share price on the London Stock Exchange has more than halved since its peak of more than €19 in the summer of 2017, now standing at €8.59. The investors suing Ryanair claim its market value was previously ‘artificially inflated’ and that O’Leary ‘personally cashed in on such artificial inflation’ by selling shares worth $120 million (£97 million) during this period.  Ryanair has rubbished the ‘ambulance-chasing’ claim, applying for it to be dismissed from the US courts. But lawyers from Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd are set to hit back on behalf of investors this week in a bid to keep the legal action alive. The original legal claim was filed in November last year by the City of Birmingham Firemen’s and Policemen’s Supplemental Pension System and City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System in Alabama. The claim – which Ryanair responded to in June and acknowledged in its annual report last month – is scathing in its descriptions of the airline which, it says, is ‘known for taking the “no-frills” experience to extreme levels’.   O’Leary, it said, has a ‘reputation as an aggressive and penny-pinching, albeit brilliant, businessman who, in his own words, “didn’t give a s***” what customers or the general public thought of him’. But, the claim added, that because Ryanair’s flights ‘were the cheapest in the market and had high rates of punctuality, customers were willing to overlook insult and continue to flock to Ryanair’.

Mayur lives in Singapore with his wife and their two children. My story before 2012 “When someone with experience proposes a deal to someone with money, too often the fellow with money ends up with the experience, and the fellow with experience ends up with the money.” - Berkshire Hathaway annual letter 2006 So what changed in 2012? In the year 2012 by sheer luck, I picked up the book ""The Intelligent Investor"" on the airport and immediately got hooked into it. It made so much sense. It also introduced Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to me. I read everything I could find on Buffett and Munger. It turned me on. I was fortunate to have found my true interest relatively early in life. I decided to refocus and look at mistakes through the lens of opportunity and learning, and more importantly, I decided to learn from other people's mistakes. Confidence rises faster than ability, especially in young men. I learned the skill of changing my mind, discarding old beliefs and replacing them with new truths when I learned new things or as the new facts arose. It was hard, but necessary. Firstly, I realized that it is difficult to find something that is really good. So, if you say 'No' ninety percent of the time, you're not missing much in the world. Avoiding the dumb things is the most important. I learned more, understood limitations, and started seeing patterns which helped me to avoid dumb things. Secondly, taking the cue from Charlie Munger, I decided to sell the best hour in the day to myself (to improve my own mind) and the world could have the rest of my time. Slowly it increased to 5-6 hours a day. It’s amazing how it worked. That's how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. I watched and deeply studied a lot of great investors. People who follow Graham, Buffett & Munger path, everyone’s done fairly well. I learned that this is as sure as you can get to become a successful investor. It helped me to compound my personal investments as well, at a very good rate of return. Finally, I learned that investing is not easy.

More," The Star Edition CHANGE LOCATION       We’re heading into what might be the quietest week of the summer as the earnings season comes to a close and investors ease into the Labor Day long weekend. But there’s still news to watch, as Group of Seven leaders meet in France, trade tensions escalate and four of the six major Canadian banks report fiscal third-quarter results. Economic growth figures for Canada are due Friday. President Donald Trump’s twitter tirade upended markets globally Friday with the S&P/TSX Composite Index down 1.3 per cent, for a second weekly decline. The slide in Canadian stocks wasn’t as painful as the plunge in their U.S. counterparts — the Nasdaq was down 3 per cent — thanks to the heavy weighting of gold miners in Canada. The S&P/TSX Materials Index — which has an 11.9 per cent weighting on the TSX — was the only winner with an 1.8 per cent climb. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Now on to earnings. It looks like money manager Steve Eisman’s short bets on Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce haven’t panned out. At least not yet.

Wealth-management profits rose 11 per cent.CIBC reported that its U.S. operations and higher revenue lifted profits.Still, it’s worth noting that RBC fell for a fifth consecutive week, its longest losing streak since 2016. The stock has slumped about 10 per cent since its April peak. In Eisman’s interview with BNN Bloomberg Thursday — where he disclosed a short position in retailer Canadian Tire Corp. — he reiterated his short bets on both banks, as well as Laurentian Bank of Canada and alternative lender Home Capital Group Inc..

11,Jet Airways resolution process: Another foreign entity shows interest - The Financial Express,"Jet Airways resolution process: Another foreign entity shows interest. Etihad Airways, a strategic partner of Jet Airways, also backed out","By Anwesha Ganguly The resolution professional (RP) for Jet Airways has received a fresh expression of interest (EoI) from a “known foreign entity”, two people with knowledge of the matter told FE. The committee of creditors (CoC) for Jet Airways will meet on August 26 to consider the proposal, which came in this week. The CoC will also try to resolve the dispute over Siroya Centre, Jet’s headquarters till recently, sources said. “A fresh EoI was received this week which looks promising. Since it came after the deadline had ended on August 10, it will be taken up for the CoC’s consideration on Monday. Of the three EoIs that were submitted before the deadline, Volcan Investments has officially withdrawn its EoI this week and Avantulo group was not provisionally shortlisted,” one of the persons mentioned above said.
Volcan Investments is the family-owned trust of Anil Agarwal, the founder and executive chairman of Vedanta Resources. Etihad Airways, a strategic partner of Jet Airways, also backed out of the resolution process earlier this month stating “there remained very significant issues relating to Jet’s liabilities.” Before the August 10 deadline, two other parties — Panama-based Avantulo Group and a Russian entity, Treasury RA Creator — had submitted EoIs. The CoC will also take up the settlement proposal put forth by the legal counsel for Luckystar, the owner of Siroya Centre, over the disputed premises. Luckystar had approached the tribunal last month seeking to repossess Siroya Centre, the six-storey building which was the headquarters of Jet Airways; the lease expired on June 7. The legal counsel for Luckystar has since put forth a settlement proposal, which, if agreed upon by the CoC, will lead to Jet Airways vacating the premises. Additionally, the CoC will take up the settlement proposal put forth by HDFC regarding the dispute on keeping Godrej BKC out of Jet’s resolution proceedings. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) will hear both matters on August 28. The CoC will also discuss the delayed release of the Rs 70-crore interim financing approved by lenders during the first meeting on July 16. Of that amount, only Rs 10 crore has so far been disbursed by the State Bank of India.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Tanya Powley, Transport Correspondent Passengers have vented their fury at BA’s handling of a planned walkout by pilots next month. Members of the British Airline Pilots’ Association, Balpa, which represents a majority of BA’s pilots, confirmed plans to walk out on September 9, 10 and 27 after pay talks between the union and Britain’s flag carrier broke down. Over the weekend, passengers took to social media to vent their frustration about being unable to get through to BA as they sought to re-book their cancelled flights. “Impossible to contact BA,” tweeted one. “Cant even get in a queue — all the lines just hang up. Not as if this has been sprung on them at the last minute. The pilots have been threatening strikes for months. Get your act together.” A user named @sonicrog tweeted: “After working hard all year the strike has left my young family with no summer holiday together. I can’t begin to describe how awful this is. You and your staff have let them down and I’ll never fly with you again.” BA later apologised after admitting that some passengers were mistakenly told that their flights were cancelled on non-strike days. BA admitted its customer service phone lines were busy but said its website was working fine. “We are doing absolutely everything we can to prevent this unfair action from taking place and ruining our customers’ travel plans,” said BA. “Airlines have a very complex operation and during times of widespread disruption, there can be knock-on effect on to flights on other days,” it added. Last month, members of Balpa voted 9-1 in favour of strike action, on a 90 per cent turnout. BA subsequently failed in an attempt to block mass walkouts through a court injunction. Balpa said the decision to go on strike was a “last resort” and had been taken with “enormous frustration at the way business is now being run”. It added that “it is clear following discussions with members over the past few days that BA’s most recent offer will not gain the support of anywhere near a majority of its pilots”. The airline said it had made a “very fair offer” and it was “completely unacceptable that Balpa is destroying the travel plans of tens of thousands” of customers.

Chase Adds Emirates Skywards as Airline Transfer Partner.,"   SHOW MORE  Many or all of the products featured here are from our partners who compensate us. This may influence which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Chase has landed another airline as a travel transfer partner. As of Aug. 25, 2019, cardholders with eligible Chase credit cards have the option of transferring their Chase Ultimate Rewards® points into Emirates Skywards miles at a 1:1 ratio. Emirates Skywards is the loyalty program for Emirates and flydubai, two airlines based in Dubai. The addition gives more choices to those with Chase cards that allow 1:1 point transfers to travel partners. Because Emirates is the only airline that offers direct flights from the U.S. to Dubai, according to the travel comparison site SkyScanner, this news could be especially good for folks interested in booking such an itinerary. It’s also a boon for those hoping to snag a spot in one of the airline’s famous first-class cabins, or travel to one of the 80-plus countries and territories it serves. Here’s what you should know. Eligible Chase cardholders can make transfers in 1,000-point increments, at a 1:1 ratio. In other words, you can turn 50,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards® points into 50,000 Emirates Skywards miles. The points transfer instantly, Chase confirms. It’s possible to combine cash and miles on Emirates. If you don’t have enough Skywards miles for an award ticket, you can use a combination of cash and miles for the redemption. This can make it easier to cash in even small amounts of rewards. Enough miles can get you into Emirates’ first-class cabins. Emirates’ first-class cabins are luxurious, featuring fine dining, an onboard shower and seats that convert into beds. And with enough Skywards miles, you could pay for such a trip. A round-trip first-class flex fare from Los Angeles to Dubai costs 247,500 Skywards miles, as of this writing. When you consider that such an itinerary could otherwise cost upward of $10,000 in cash, that’s a pretty sweet deal. Emirates’ surcharges can be expensive. When flying on Emirates with miles, you’ll still have to pay taxes and fees, including the airline’s hefty carrier-imposed surcharges. Those can add up to hundreds of dollars even when flying economy, and can potentially devalue your miles.

A look at the life and fortune of John McCain, who had a sprawling real estate portfolio and donated","  August 25, 2019, marks the one-year anniversary of Senator John McCain's death. He passed away on August 25, 2018, at age 81, shortly after his family announced he would no longer continue receiving medical treatment for brain cancer. He had reportedly been spending time at his ranch home in Sedona, Arizona, where he was receiving a flood of visitors as he battled glioblastoma, reported Town & Country. In honor of his death a year later, his daughter, Meghan, took to Twitter to express her grief and his wife Cindy encouraged others to perform acts of civility. In a statement, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden also encouraged others to engage in civility acts, calling McCain ""a political giant"" and ""a genuine American hero."" McCain's new memoir, ""The Restless Wave,"" was released in May 2018. You may know McCain as the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, a Vietnam war vet, or an advocate for more civil politics. What you may not know is that McCain and his wife Cindy sat on a private, but hefty fortune. He was reportedly worth $16 million, according to Celebritynetworth.com. But that's only a fraction of what was his wealth — the rest came from his wife, who is an heiress to Hensley & Co., one of the largest Anheuser-Busch distributors.
