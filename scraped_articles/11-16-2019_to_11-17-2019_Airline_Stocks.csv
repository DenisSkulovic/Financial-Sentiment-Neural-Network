0,3 Top Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now | The Motley Fool,"3 Top Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now. An aerospace company, an infrastructural machinery play, and a motion control company","   Small-cap stocks tend to be under-researched and under-followed, and this can sometimes create buying opportunities for investors willing to go the extra mile to find them. What's more, they can come from a variety of industries and give you exposure to fast-growing or even nascent markets.  Let's look at three that stand out today. AAR Corp (NYSE:AIR) is a play on the growth in commercial aviation and the need to service aircraft. Federal Signal (NYSE:FSS) benefits from increased municipal, industrial, and utilities spending on environmental solutions (street cleaning, safe digging, etc.), and Altra Industrial Motion (NASDAQ:AIMC) is a play on a potential recovery in motion control and power transmission product end markets. The company is a global provider of aviation support services to the commercial and military markets. In plain English, this means supplying parts as well as repair and engineering services to airlines. Customers include major airlines such as Delta, Lufthansa, Southwest, and United Airlines as well as FedEx, UPS, and the U.S. Air Force. As such, AAR works with the leading original equipment suppliers such as General Electric, United Technologies, and Northrop Grumman. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The key to its long-term growth prospects are the health of the commercial aviation market -- a very strong market at present, as the results of United Technologies and others attest -- and specifically, the number of ""shop visits"" made by aircraft that need airframes and, more importantly, engines serviced and overhauled. It's a great market to be in as worldwide airline profitability and passenger growth remains in robust growth, and both United Technologies and General Electric are bullish on the aftermarket opportunity for long-established engines like the V2500 (Airbus A320 family) and the CFM56 (Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737 family). DATA SOURCE: INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION PRESENTATIONS. AAR's management sees the company as growing organic sales at a 5% to 10% annual rate over the long term and EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Analyst forecasts are for a combination of mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-teens EPS growth for the next couple of years. With the stock trading at less than 17 times next year's EPS forecast of $2.61, it looks like a good value for its long-term growth prospects.

1,Under-the-radar trend suggests new market highs into 2020: Stovall,"Under-the-radar trend suggests Wall Street isn’t bullish enough, CFRA’s Sam Stovall says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Even though stocks are trading around all-time highs, CFRA’s Sam Stovall thinks Wall Street isn’t bullish enough. According to the firm’s chief investment strategist, an under-the-radar historical trend suggests the S&P 500 will continue to reach record levels through December. He credits a phenomenon that’s only happened 28 times since WWII. Stovall highlighted the pattern in a chart on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”  “There’s something special about this year. We had a positive move in the market in both January and February,” Stovall said on Thursday. “February is the second worst month of the year — second only to September. It’s usually a digestive month.” When the market is up the first two months of the year, Stovall notes the S&P has been up 100% of the time. He estimates the average total return is 24% for the full year. So far this year, the index is up 24.4%. However, that doesn’t mean market gains are in for 2019. Stovall points to another unusual characteristic of the year’s record run: Stocks hit highs this month, too. “Throw in a new all-time high in early November and you’re essentially flat to higher 11 of 11 times,” he added. Stovall came into 2019 with a 2,975 year-end S&P price target — about 5% below Friday’s close of 3,120, a record high. He’s now focused more on his 12 month rolling target of 3,200. The Dow also hit a milestone on Friday. It closed above 28,000 for the first time ever. Despite his upbeat forecast, he acknowledges some risks lie ahead. “If you end up with a strong end of year run that could be borrowing a bit from what we would expect in 2020,” Stovall said. “So, as I frequently say, I call myself a bull with a lower case ‘b.’” Note: The S&P 500 was created in 1957 from back-tested data.

4,Estimating The Fair Value Of Qantas Airways Limited (ASX:QAN) - Simply Wall St News,Estimating The Fair Value Of Qantas Airways Limited (ASX:QAN). Step by step through the calculation. 10-year free cash flow (FCF),"How far off is Qantas Airways Limited (ASX:QAN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This is done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Qantas Airways We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: (""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = AU$5.2b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 10-year government bond rate of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.1%.

Hydrogen strategy for Canada is impressive: Proton Technologies CEO Alberta is prepared to support the hydrogen industry: Associate minister of natural gas The future of work: How the pandemic will reshape the labour force   Nov 16, 2019  Kristine Owram, Bloomberg News Wall Street’s exuberance over legal weed has quickly curdled into sober reality. In a matter of months, white-hot cannabis companies have flamed out in spectacular fashion. Many have lost two-thirds or more of their value. Widespread legalization has been thwarted. Bank financing has dried up. Deep-pocketed institutional investors remain on the sidelines and old-fashioned black-market dealers still provide stiff competition. The pain deepened on Thursday, when Ontario-based Canopy Growth Corp. announced revenue that fell short of the lowest Wall Street estimate and a loss that one analyst called “astounding.” That sent shares to the lowest since December 2017. It’s still the largest pot company in the world, but at $7.1 billion its market value is just a sliver of the $24 billion it reached in April.

Big markets like Canada and California had legalized recreational use, while populous states such as New York and New Jersey were expected to follow suit.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Monte Carlo Fashions Limited (NSE:MONTECARLO). Over the last twelve months Monte Carlo Fashions has recorded a ROE of 12%. Another way to think of that is that for every ₹1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn ₹0.12. Check out our latest analysis for Monte Carlo Fashions The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders' Equity Or for Monte Carlo Fashions: 12% = ₹573m ÷ ₹4.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.) Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets. ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses. Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Monte Carlo Fashions has a superior ROE than the average (7.1%) company in the Luxury industry. That's what I like to see. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.       The group offers good appreciation potential, while providing some downside protection if the stock market falters in 2021.","Nov 17, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monte-carlo-fashions-limiteds-nse-072251791.html

Now the author of the memoir A Song for You: My Life With Whitney Houston is sitting down with Jada Pinkett Smith on the next Red Table Talk to discuss the music legend’s death in 2012. Houston was 48 years old when she accidentally drowned in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton, with heart disease and cocaine use cited as contributing factors. In a preview shared by Pinkett Smith, Crawford admits it is “hard” for her to accept her friend’s death by drowning. “When Whitney passed, I was flooded with emotions,” Crawford tells Pinkett Smith, who appears without co-hosts and family members Willow Smith and Adrienne Banfield Norris in the clip from next Monday’s show. “I was angry. I never once believed that she would fall. “Swimming is what she loved to do,” Crawford added. “I mean, girl could swim. She loved the water. And that’s why passing in the water just is so crazy, like hard for me to wrap my heart and head around.” The episode also sees Crawford sharing that there was “no shame” in her physical relationship with Houston, who she tells Pinkett Smith would have been an ideal guest for Red Table Talk.

Site Index,"These narrow-moat firms have positive moat trends and are run by exemplary stewards of capital. Many families have their go-to recipes for pound cake. Some call for almond extract or lemon juice--or rum--to provide extra flavor. Others say to top the cake with a glaze or powdered sugar. Still others (like our family's recipe) keep it simple, with no topping and just a hint of vanilla. No matter the extras, all pound cake recipes share four key ingredients: butter, eggs, flour, and sugar. Similarly, companies poised to become industry leaders--in our parlance, those seeking wide-moat status--share some of the same ingredients. For instance, they have a competitive advantage (or two)--maybe that's high switching costs, powerful brands, or a significant cost advantage. In other words, they've begun to carve out an economic moat. But they aren't resting on those competitive advantages. Instead, these companies continue to dig a moat by exploiting trends in their industries. And they're run by smart capital allocators who make shrewd investment decisions to keep the company competitive. Today's screen isolates companies with those qualities. We're looking at narrow-moat companies with positive moat trends that also earn Exemplary marks for stewardship. While there's no guarantee that these companies will eventually establish wide moats, they certainly have the right ingredients to do so.

Perhaps not surprisingly, most of these well-run companies are fairly or overvalued according to our measures. But they’re all topnotch watchlist candidates.

Air Products & Chemicals (APD)
Morningstar Rating (as of 11/14/19): 3 stars One of the leading industrial gas suppliers globally, Air Products benefits from operating in an industry with a favorable cost structure, argues analyst Krzysztof Smalec. Uninterrupted product is key, and customers are often willing to pay a premium and sign long-term contracts to ensure that business runs smoothly. And those long-term contracts and high switching costs contribute to the company’s narrow moat.

Moreover, we think its moat is growing, says Smalec. Management’s increasing emphasis on on-site business leads to longer average customer contract terms, which enhances switching costs. Moreover, the firm has seen a remarkable improvement in margins since CEO Seifi Ghasemi took the helm in 2014.

Speaking of management, we rate Air Products’ team as exemplary. Ghasemi’s five-point plan to transform the company has led to margin expansion, divestiture of noncore segments, reduced debt, and improved earnings per share growth. “We believe Ghasemi management has been proactive about pursuing growth opportunities and appropriately managing its","Nov 16, 2019",https://www.morningstar.com/articles/885581/7-wide-moat-stocks-of-tomorrow

RELATED. 737 MAX CRISIS. Boeing’s","After months of intense scrutiny, even some of the harshest critics of the 737 MAX’s flight-control system believe Boeing’s software fix will prevent a recurrence of the scenarios that killed 346 people in the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Boeing has redesigned the MAX’s new automated Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) that relentlessly pushed down the noses of the two aircraft on both crash flights. Though serious questions linger about the overall safety culture at Boeing that waved through MCAS’s original development and certification, U.S. airline pilots are almost ready to fly the updated jet. “The hazard is designed out of it,” Capt. John DeLeeuw, chairman of the safety committee of the Allied Pilots Association (APA), the union for American Airlines pilots, declared to colleagues a week after trying the flight-control fix in a Boeing simulator in Miami in late September. Bjorn Fehrm, an aerospace engineer and former fighter pilot in the Swedish Air Force, now a France-based aviation analyst with Leeham.net, has said Boeing’s original MCAS design was “criminally badly done … unforgivable,” and compared the system’s aggressiveness to a tiger. He too believes the redesign now makes the airplane as safe as the previous 737 model. “There’s no part of any airplane out there that’s been as thoroughly vetted,” said Fehrm. “MCAS is no longer a tiger, but a house cat.” The final pieces of that vetting are now imminent. Boeing expects the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to formally unground the jet next month and to pin down all the pilot training requirements in January.  That’s pending a formal certification flight and a final evaluation of the software fix for the jet’s flight controls. And the FAA insisted Friday that it will take its time and won’t be swayed by pressure from Boeing. After the FAA clears the plane to fly and issues the pilot training regimen, Boeing and the U.S. airlines will need 30 to 40 days to complete the enormous logistical challenge of getting their airplanes ready to fly after the better part of a year in storage. Boeing will install the final software fix, refresh all the fluids and lubricants, do ground tests on the engines and flight controls, then conduct a checkout flight. The FAA will inspect every plane. More The worldwide fleet of MAXs previously delivered to airlines was 385, including 72 jets at U.S. airlines.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Alice Hancock in Düsseldorf There are few more nerve-racking moments on holiday than the walk between the hotel reception and your room after you check in.  “Usually the blood pressure goes up and then you see the room and you either say wow or you say God, let’s change it,” said Friedrich Joussen, chief executive of the Anglo-German package tour operator Tui. Tui’s guests should no longer have to suffer this uncertainty, he said. For an extra €10-€15 per night, they can choose rooms with morning or evening sun, be close to the restaurant, or even specify a particular number.  Despite demand for package holidays remaining stable, traditional operators have had to adapt to compete with online booking services providing holidaygoers with hundreds of options. The pressures on the industry were laid bare by the collapse in September of Thomas Cook, Tui’s longtime rival, after it failed to put together a restructuring package with its debtholders. “For the remaining players, I think the short term is very clear. It’s positive. We have less competition,” said Mr Joussen. “But long term, that’s a question we need to ask ourselves: what happened and why it happened? And why we don’t want it to happen to us?” Since September, Tui has tried to take advantage of the weaker competition, announcing it will increase its airline capacity by 2m seats next summer and adding 135 former Thomas Cook hotels to its books. Last month, it made a bid for the Thomas Cook brand but was beaten by Fosun, the Chinese conglomerate that was the failed group’s majority shareholder. Mr Joussen put Thomas Cook’s failure down to “too little differentiation”.  “When you have no differentiation, you are head to head competing with the internet. People are fine with packages because it’s comfort. People are not fine with being treated like anybody else.” The capability to offer personalised booking “is something which will change our whole company,” Mr Joussen claimed. About 30 per cent of Tui customers were opting to pay extra to book a specific room — with options also including proximity to restaurants for parents using baby monitors.
