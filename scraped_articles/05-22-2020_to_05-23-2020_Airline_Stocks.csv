0,Stock Market News: Will Airline Stocks Rise When Flyers Return? | The Motley Fool,Stock Market News: Will Airline Stocks Rise When Flyers Return?. Some investors seem skeptical about a potential rebound for the,"   The stock market moved lower on Friday morning, with sentiment among investors taking a hit from ongoing nervousness about the reopening of the U.S. economy. Even as people start to return to work and businesses ramp their operations back up, there's an increasing recognition that getting back to business as usual won't be a reasonable expectation in the immediate future. Just after 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down 140 points to 24,334. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) lost 12 points to 2,937, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) fell 27 points to 9,258. One industry that has a big task ahead of it is the airline business. Even amid signs that passengers might finally start to fly again, shareholders in key industry players like Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) aren't convinced that the worst is over for their respective companies. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Ever since local shutdowns went into effect, airline travel volumes have plunged. Already, Delta, American, Southwest, and United have reduced their domestic flight schedules by roughly 70% to 90%, reflecting the huge reduction in the number of passengers taking to the skies. On April 14, the Transportation Security Administration reported just over 87,500 passengers went through its airport security checkpoints, down more than 96% from the 2.21 million travelers on the same day in 2019. However, traffic levels are starting to rebound. On May 21, almost 318,500 travelers went through TSA checkpoints. That was still down 88% from where traffic was a year ago, but it was up by more than two-thirds from its level just two days before and the best day for air travel since March 23. Even with the gains, though, airline shareholders didn't celebrate. Stocks in the sector were down 2% to 3% Friday morning despite the traffic news. The apparent disconnect between the positive news and the way that investors interpreted it makes sense when you consider some of the longer-term ramifications for the airline industry. Even as more passengers start traveling by air again, air travel in the future could look a lot different from the business model that's been so profitable for airlines over the past decade. Consider some of the things that airlines are going to have to do: Already, some airlines have made big moves to reduce their size.

3,Airline Stocks Abandoned by Buffett - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Airline Stocks Abandoned by Buffett. Challenging operating environment for airlines. Weaker airline,"      Matt Smith | May 22, 2020 | More on: AC Airline stocks have been pummelled by the coronavirus pandemic. Even Warren Buffett sold his stake in the four major U.S. carriers and admitted he made a mistake. Airlines stocks dipped sharply after Buffett offloaded his entire holding of Delta Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airline. Air Canada (TSX:AC), despite not being a Buffett investment, was also dragged down.  Buffett’s foray into airlines caught many investors by surprise. The Oracle of Omaha had long derided the industry, even describing it as a death-trap for investors. Buffett’s sale may have contributed to Berkshire Hathaway’s US$50 billion loss for the three months to March 2020. After disclosing the sale, Buffett said, “The world has changed for the airlines.” He was referring to the impact of the coronavirus and how the pandemic has effectively shut down the global travel and tourism industry. The CEO of Air Canada recently stated that it may take up to three years for airline travel volumes to return to something resembling pre-coronavirus levels. This will have a sharp impact on many airlines, especially those with high debt and costs. The profound impact of the coronavirus on airlines has already been reflected in their first-quarter 2020 results.  Delta, the largest U.S. carrier by revenue, has shed 62% since the start of 2020. It reported a first-quarter US$534 million loss. Delta has loaded up on debt, boosting its liquidity to survive the crisis. Since early March it has raised US$5.4 billion in capital and drew down US$3 billion under existing credit facilities. Delta is focused on slashing costs and has reduced capital expenditures by US$3 billion. This is being driven by sharp flight reductions. Delta has cut domestic capacity by 80% and international by 90%. Substantially weaker oil prices will also aid Delta and other airlines, considerably reducing fuel costs, which is one of the most significant expenses faced by airlines. While Delta will certainly emerge from the current crisis the tremendous amount of debt that it took on will weigh on its financial performance for some time to come. Delta also operates in a hotly contested U.S. market, meaning it faces considerable competition. That with a substantial debt load and considerable financing costs will weigh on Delta’s profitability. Air Canada, which has lost 70%, announced a $1 billion first-quarter loss.","May 22, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/05/22/airline-stocks-abandoned-by-buffett/
4,Investing in Airlines Amid COVID-19 | ETF Trends,Investing in Airlines Amid COVID-19. How long could it take for travel demand to return to pre-virus levels? Will the,"By Frank Holmes, CEO and CIO, U.S. Global Investors The airline sector may be experiencing some turbulence now with COVID-19, but the industry has flown through storms before. After all, airlines stocks managed recoveries after the 9/11 attacks, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008. Investors are increasingly curious about airlines as stocks have seen bigger selloff than the wider market and could be an attractive buying opportunity. Our dedicated airline ETF has seen a massive increase in inflows since the coronavirus pandemic began, jumping from $52 million at the end of 2019 to $302 million as of March 31. Earlier this week I participated in a webcast in partnership with ETF Trends to answer advisors’ questions about investing in airlines and the impact of COVID-19. The advisors on the webcast were extremely engaged and asked numerous questions. Below are the most frequently asked questions and my responses. It’s hard to predict when travel demand will fully recover. However, we’ve already seen an increase in commercial air passengers as lockdown restrictions are eased. The number of people the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened bottomed at 87,500 on April 14 and since then it’s risen steadily. As of May 20, the TSA screened more than 230,000 people, a gain of about 163 percent from the low. Remote work has always been a threat to business travel demand. More companies will likely transition to fully remote working post-lockdown, but I believe some travel will still be necessary for businesses.

In early May, the “Oracle of Omaha” revealed that he recently dumped his entire stake in the big four U.S. airlines—Delta, American, United and Southwest. As of the end of December, the position collectively stood at around $10 billion. Buffett’s decision to exit airlines seems to have stemmed directly from the coronavirus lockdown and its impact on the travel industry. In other words, it had nothing to do with how the carriers were being managed. While I agree with Buffett that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for airlines, I disagree with his decision to dump airline stocks for that reason.

  |  A+A A- File Image of an Indigo Aircraft for representational purposes. (Photo | Reuters) NEW DELHI: The markets on Thursday reacted enthusiastically to the resumption of passenger flight services after a two-month hiatus. Shares of IndiGo jumped 9.9 per cent on the BSE, making it the best-performing stock; SpiceJet shares to locked in the upper circuit of 5 per cent at Rs 42.95, compared to its previous close of Rs 40.95. Shares of InterGlobe Aviation closed 7.28 per cent higher at Rs 978.25. The rise in stock prices is a big relief to the two listed airlines, who have seen a plunge of more than 50 per cent from their 52-week highs in the last one year, owing to numerous challenges. All commercial passenger flights in India were suspended late March when the government imposed a nationwide lockdown to contain Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, every airline barring IndiGo has struggled to meet the fixed costs and even pay salaries.   On Wednesday evening, Union aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced that domestic flights will resume from May 25 in a calibrated manner, and on Thursday, the Central government came out with standard operating procedures and guidelines. Two major directions that are set to impact the airlines are resumption of operations at one-third capacity and capping the fares for three months. According to analysts, while the new move will give some respite to the industry, any favourable impact would depend on the demand, which at the moment looks bleak. “In the initial phase, passengers with emergency needs will board the flight. Load factor will also play a crucial role in determining profitability of the airlines. Airlines also stand to benefit from cheap crude prices. But all said, any favourable impact on the industry is dependent on demand, which is not going to be strong in near future,” said Kinjal Shah, vice-president, ICRA.

Airline Stocks Are,"                    By MONEY MORNING STAFF REPORTS, Money Morning • May 22, 2020              Airlines were some of the hardest-hit stocks during the bear market brought about by the coronavirus. In fact, the Dow Jones U.S. Airline Index is still down 60% today from its Feb. 12 closing high. Even worse, last week's low was below the initial panic low in March. In other words, the broad market's rebound happened without any help from airlines at all.  So is now a good time to buy airline stocks? Money Morning Chief Investment Strategist Shah Gilani says it's ""up in the air"" in a bad way. The broad view is that most industries will recover, but not all. And we're going to show you why today. Then we'll show you an industry to buy instead as the economy recovers. First, here's why there's no telling the fate of the airline sector… With such a disparity in performance, investors might see this as a buying opportunity. Airline stocks have nowhere to go but up, right? The economy is starting to open. People are itching to get back to work and to move about like they used to. COVID-19 lockdowns inspired a lifestyle change that's kicking a new billion-dollar market into high gear – and this stock is the best way to play it. Get the pick here – it's free… Many businesses are learning to adapt to social distancing and facemasks. They are cleaning their restaurants and stores to prevent the spread of the virus. And they want to make customers feel safe and comfortable spending their money. Why aren't airlines included here? They're taking every measure to keep customers and employees safe, after all. They're blocking middle seats and changing boarding procedures to help customers. They know people are still very leery of being cooped in a flying tube with strangers. Airline stocks even offer some beefy dividend yields. For example, Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL) has a dividend yield of 6.96%. And price/earnings ratios are among the lowest. Delta's trailing p/e is 4.33. So why then are people like Warren Buffett steering clear of the airline sector?

Airline stocks, having had a record-breaking decade, are now seen as nothing","Whenever I used to travel, my girlfriend would force me to pack disinfecting napkins and promise to wipe my area down immediately upon sitting. I would scoff and mock but I would catch a cold nearly every time I didn’t do it. Today, thanks to the highly contagious COVID-19 pandemic, it’s almost impossible to fly as airlines have drastically reduced their routes and schedules.  This has battered revenue and stock prices, causing even Warren Buffett to drop his airline investment, which was worth $4 billion in December. The airlines turned to the government for assistance and got it conditionally in the form of $25 billion of the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, with an additional $25 billion available as low-interest loans for general expenses. Stipulations for receiving the payroll-only grants include no furloughs or reduction in pay for staff until October, cessation of dividend payments and stock buybacks. Is there any hope remaining for this industry and if so, should you buy in?  Smaller airlines like Hawaiian Air (NASDAQ: HA) and Sun Country Airlines will likely go under or be purchased by the bigger players. The top airlines that will probably survive the crisis are American (NASDAQ: AAL), Delta (NYSE: DAL), United (NASDAQ: UAL), and Southwest (NYSE: LUV).  The pandemic has affected business travel, forcing companies to resort to online meetings via Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) and similar tools; this will likely be the post-pandemic norm, limiting further travel and expenses for companies and thereby decreasing ticket sales. With unemployment rates skyrocketing, people won’t be able to use disposable travel income for vacations for some time as well.  The road to recovery will be long and slow for these reasons; but how long? As with other matters related to the pandemic, the world looks to China, ground zero of the outbreak, for indication.

9,DAL Stock Is Ready to Sail Through Coronavirus Clouds | InvestorPlace,Delta Stock Is Ready to Sail Through Coronavirus Clouds. Delta is experiencing some healthy tailwinds due to its disciplined approach," Perhaps the sector that has taken the biggest hit due to the novel coronavirus is the travel industry, and airlines like Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock. Even the industry’s bigwigs are struggling to maintain a positive outlook. In an interview conducted on May 12 on NBC, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dave Calhoun warned that it might take three to five years before the industry recovers to pre-pandemic levels, and at least one major airline could go out of business by the end of this year. Nevertheless, if there were is one airline that you would bet to bounce back, it would be Delta. The company has an innovator in the industry by revamping its pricing model and investing in foreign companies to provide a cost-effective solution to their domestic needs. Delta and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) are the industry’s crème de la crème, outpacing the competition in generating healthy profits and free cash flows consistently. I think that Delta will survive this crisis and come out of this stronger because of its proactive approach towards controlling the situation. Let’s take a closer look at some of these reasons: Every airline company is looking to downsize; Delta is no different. The company is looking to reduce its costs by 50% by the second quarter. The reductions are likely to result in $5 billion in savings, which should be enough to offset the $200 million in unplanned expenses due to the pandemic. It also scaled back on its capital expenditures by $3 billion and is suspending its stock repurchase program and future dividend payments. Apart from this, the company announced that it would be parking 650 planes and instituting a company-wide hiring freeze along with voluntary leaves for its employees. Executive management will also be taking it on the chin by accepting significant pay reductions in the upcoming quarters. To provide further cushion, Delta is receiving $5.4 billion as part of the government’s CARES Act, a $50 billion relief program specifically for the airline sector. It includes $3.8 billion for direct relief and another $1.6 billion low-interest, unsecured 10-year loan. Delta has already received $2.7 billion of funds and expects the rest in the next three months. Equity dilution due to the stock warrants offered to the governments is negligible, worth 1% of Delta stock at $24.39 per share over five years.

Looking For Best Stocks To Buy This Holiday Season? 2 Making Big Moves This," BROWSING CATEGORY Travel stocks are some of the most popular among those looking to take advantage of a strong economy. When it comes to travel stocks, you’re not just looking at companies that get vacationers from point A to point B. These companies are involved in numerous supply chains on a global scale. It takes more than just airline stocks to make up travel stocks too. Needless to say, when average traders thinking about this class of stocks, the most popular travel stocks to buy are ones involving vacationers. Companies like cruise lines and even travel agencies such as Booking Holdings are names investors consider. Then again, the economy can have a direct impact on travel stocks. If people and businesses aren’t willing to spend money on travel, these stocks can feel the strain. On the other hand, with a booming economy, travel stocks become some of the best to watch. Expendable income and economic growth leading to more business travelers are just a few of the reasons. Other equity classes may find common ground among travel stocks. If you look at some of the hospitality stocks to buy, they will have exposure to travel. Booking Holdings, for example, is one of these caught in the cross-fire of travel and hospitality. Even financial stocks like American Express can be considered among travel stocks if you take their booking services into account. Are travel stocks the best to buy? That decision will have a lot to do with what’s going on in the stock market today. Nevertheless, travel remains a necessity in today’s global economy.

After all, airlines stocks managed recoveries after the 9/11 attacks, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008. Investors are increasingly curious about airlines as stocks have seen bigger selloff than the wider market and could be an attractive buying opportunity. Our dedicated airline ETF has seen a massive increase in inflows since the coronavirus pandemic began, jumping from $52 million at the end of 2019 to $302 million as of March 31. Earlier this week I participated in a webcast in partnership with ETF Trends to answer advisors’ questions about investing in airlines and the impact of COVID-19. The advisors on the webcast were extremely engaged and asked numerous questions. Below are the most frequently asked questions and my responses. It’s hard to predict when travel demand will fully recover. However, we’ve already seen an increase in commercial air passengers as lockdown restrictions are eased. The number of people the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened bottomed at 87,500 on April 14 and since then it’s risen steadily. As of May 20, the TSA screened more than 230,000 people, a gain of about 163 percent from the low. Remote work has always been a threat to business travel demand. More companies will likely transition to fully remote working post-lockdown, but I believe some travel will still be necessary for businesses. You can’t replace the human connection of meeting face-to-face with video chat. In early May, the “Oracle of Omaha” revealed that he recently dumped his entire stake in the big four U.S. airlines—Delta, American, United and Southwest. As of the end of December, the position collectively stood at around $10 billion. Buffett’s decision to exit airlines seems to have stemmed directly from the coronavirus lockdown and its impact on the travel industry. In other words, it had nothing to do with how the carriers were being managed.

17,Opinion | Regulate air safety but leave those fares alone,Opinion | Regulate air safety but leave those fares alone. . ,"Strict hygiene rules will make flying safer but arbitrary ticket price bands could make it hard for the industry to recover from the corona blow. Allow airlines strategic flexibility Airline stocks soared on Thursday after the government declared our skies open for domestic flights again, starting Monday, even as a collective sigh of relief was heaved by people stranded in cities away from home and others with urgent business to conduct in person elsewhere. For now, only about a third of India’s 7,800-odd scheduled flights are expected to resume, prompted by the need to keep airports free of crowds. As aircraft immobilized by coronavirus for two months prepare to roll onto runways, a long list of dos and don’ts has also been issued. The safety aspects of these guidelines are mostly sensible. They cover norms to be followed from end to end, all the way from local points of departure, past airport checks, aboard aeroplanes and disembarkation routines to passenger conveyance bound for eventual destinations. Residents of containment zones and people who have tested positive for covid are barred. All other flyers must submit a self-declaration form as an avowal of good health. A “safe"" sign flashed by our official infection-tracing app Aarogya Setu is a must for all those aged above 14. The other rules are broadly as one would expect, be it the masks to be worn or the distances to be maintained between one person and the next. Those who need to fly can draw additional reassurance from experts who have endorsed aviation industry claims that cabin air is filtered for microbes often enough to prevent airborne infection. What seems overdone, however, are the arbitrary price controls imposed by the Centre for three months. In an effort to contain extortionate pricing as repressed demand is let loose, it has issued airfare bands. A seat on a Delhi-Mumbai flight, for example, must sell only between ₹3,500 and ₹10,000, as reported, with 40% of all seats sold at a price lower than the midpoint. This sounds pro-consumer, but may do more harm than good if it distorts the market’s ability to balance demand and supply. Or pushes weak carriers out of business. The burden of safety protocols has made air services costlier, the shutdown has squeezed finances, and private airlines gasping for survival need all the strategic flexibility they can get. This should include the freedom to respond to","May 22, 2020",https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/regulate-air-safety-but-leave-those-fares-alone-11590082669376.html
