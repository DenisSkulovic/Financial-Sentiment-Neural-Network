0,3 Charts That Suggest It's Time to Buy Airline Stocks,"3 Charts That Suggest It's Time to Buy Airline Stocks. . U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS). United Continental Holdings, Inc.","Major investors such as Warren Buffett have invested billions of dollars into airline stocks over the past several years. Based on the charts that we'll discuss in detail below, it looks as though now could be a great time for the average investor to follow suit. The rise in popularity of niche funds such as the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) has provided both professional and retail investors with an interesting way of gaining targeted exposure to a particular market segment. More specifically, as the name suggests, the JETS ETF gives investors access to global airline operators and manufacturers with a particular focus on large-cap U.S. airlines. As you can see below, the fund has been trading within a defined range since the start of 2018, and traders are patiently waiting for the price to close above the nearby trendline to spark a flood of buy-stop orders. The recent close above the long-term resistance of the 200-day moving average is the first major hurdle, and it will be very interesting to see if the trendline will prevent a move higher like it did in the past or whether it will be able to break out this time and start the next leg of the primary uptrend. United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL) is among the top holdings of the JETS ETF with a weighting of 12.10%. As you can see from the chart pattern below, United Continental shares are currently trading within a well-established channel pattern that has dominated the price action over the past six months. Range-bound traders will look to sell near the upper trendline in anticipation of another pullback toward the lower support level. On the other hand, breakout traders will want to keep this stock on their watch lists because a break beyond $90 could be used as a catalyst of a sharp move higher. Based on the pattern, target prices will most likely be set near $102.50, which is equal to the entry point plus the height of the pattern. Another top holding of the JETS ETF that followers of technical analysis will want to keep an eye on is Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL). As you can see below, the strong performance so far in 2019 has pushed the price above its 200-day moving average. The bullish momentum has also resulted in a bullish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (shown by blue","Jun 25, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/3-charts-that-suggest-it-s-time-to-buy-airline-stocks-4690863
1,Exclusive: How 1 Scrappy All-Business-Class Airline Carved Out a Niche for Itself | The Motley Fool,Exclusive: How 1 Scrappy All-Business-Class Airline Carved Out a Niche for Itself. Boutique airline La Compagnie has successfully taken on,"   In recent years, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines, and United Continental and their European joint-venture partners have dominated the trans-Atlantic travel market. On many key routes, a single alliance controls a huge share of the market. The New York-Paris route is no exception. Delta and joint venture partner Air France operate about half of the nonstop flights on this route, with six daily flights this summer. The other big carriers fly the route just once or twice a day. Yet over the past five years, boutique French airline La Compagnie has been able to elbow its way into the New York-Paris travel market with a 100%-business-class offering. With a new fleet of Airbus (OTC:EADSY) A321neos arriving this year, the airline's outlook is brighter than ever. I recently spoke with La Compagnie co-founder Jean-Charles Perino, who provided some additional context on how this little airline has managed to hold its own against much bigger rivals. La Compagnie began operations in July 2014 -- nearly five years ago. Initially, it operated a single daily flight between Newark International Airport (just outside New York City) and Paris. Perino said that the airline's founders thought there was room for a carrier dedicated to providing affordable all-business-class service in the trans-Atlantic market. Of course, incumbents like Delta and Air France have lots of business-class seats on their long-haul jets. But they often charge thousands of dollars each way for business-class tickets. La Compagnie undercuts its rivals with round-trip fares as low as $1,000 (and frequently below $2,000). LA COMPAGNIE OFFERS CHEAPER BUSINESS-CLASS FARES THAN ITS LARGER RIVALS. IMAGE SOURCE: LA COMPAGNIE. Initially, La Compagnie's service appealed more to well-to-do leisure travelers and cost-sensitive business travelers from small and medium-sized businesses. However, as La Compagnie proved its staying power -- and particularly after it added a second daily Newark-Paris flight a few years ago -- it started to get more business from larger corporations. Today, the carrier has a balanced customer mix, with 60% of passengers traveling for business and 40% for leisure. Furthermore, despite La Compagnie being based in France, Perino noted that U.S.-based travelers account for 60% of its traffic. A growing piece of its business comes from travelers who ""self-connect"" by buying a separate ticket on a different airline to connect to a La Compagnie flight, either in Newark or in Paris. This indicates that many customers are willing","Jun 26, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/26/exclusive-how-1-scrappy-all-business-class-airline.aspx

3,One beaten-down Chinese tech stock could be on the verge of a breakout,One beaten-down Chinese tech stock could be on the verge of a breakout. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC,"Chinese tech stocks have taken a tumble. The BATS trade — Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Sina — has come under pressure this quarter. Those losses have been so sharp for Baidu and Sina that they are on track to close out the second quarter with their worst loss since at least 2010. Michael Binger, president of Gradient Investments, says there’s still hope yet for these Chinese stocks, an emerging-market alternative to the FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet. “I don’t think the BATS stocks are untouchable. I think you need to tread lightly,” Binger said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “I think sentiment more than fundamentals is weighing on these stocks.” Binger says while they all could rebound, just one of the BATS names looks best to break out. “I would really go with Alibaba,” he said. “Alibaba is the leading e-commerce company in China. It’s one of the leading e-commerce companies in the world. I think over the next 10 years it’s going to be a neck-and-neck race between Amazon and Alibaba. They have 600 million-plus active users and it’s growing fast. Their sales growth is north of 30%. It’s at the lower end of its valuation range, so yeah, I think you could step in right here.” The whole Chinese internet trade could still be in for more downside, according to Mark Newton, technical analyst at Newton Advisors. He says the KWEB China internet ETF could mirror any weakness in the U.S. markets. “It’s acted very similar to how the U.S. has acted over the last year. We bottomed right near Christmas Eve, rallied up until the beginning of May, we peaked — we bottomed out in early June, and now we’re starting to roll over again,” Newton said during the same segment. “My thinking is we do move lower short term to areas right near $39, which is June lows, or potentially a bit lower.”  The KWEB ETF, whose stocks include Alibaba, Baidu and JD.com, would need to decline by nearly 8% to reach Newton’s $39 target. It has not traded firmly below that level since early January. “I see a bit more lagging to go for China. I do think this will be attractive potentially in a month or two on further weakness, but for now I think it’s an avoid,” said Newton. Disclosure: Gradient owns Alibaba shares.

Cash-strapped domestic airlines,"," Cash-strapped domestic airlines, Jet Airways share price surged 10% on Monday's intraday trading session, carrying forward the extended rally of previous three trading days. The shares of the debt-laden firm are witnessing a buying trend with over 140% price hike in last three days. The shares opened at a day high of Rs 80 on Monday on BSE, despite hitting the all time low of Rs 27 on Thursday. There are few factors that are triggering the activity in Jet Airways share price on Dalal Street.  Jet Airways was dragged to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) over its default payment case and proceedings for the same have already started. While the insolvency case still awaits the revival or recovery of millions of debt pending with the company. The airline owes Rs 8,500 crore in total to banks and around Rs 25,000 crore in arrears to vendors, lessors and employees.  Research Head, Joindre Capital Services, Avinash Gorakshakar told Zee Business Online, ''The domestic market is heading towards the F&O expiry on June 27th for the month and investors are short covering their contracts. The company has already shut down its business and is dragged to NCLT by SBI, no investor would be keen to buy equity in current scenario. The cash market is witnessing an upward trend due to short covering in F&O contracts and after June 27, the share may get tumbled again, while the volatility till expiry is still expected.'' Jet Airways is the first domestic airliner to go into bankruptcy after the Mumbai bench of the NCLT admitted an insolvency petition filed by SBI on behalf of 26 lenders on June 20th. While some analysts on the street also state the reason for a rally as it comes ahead of the order from National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on insolvency plea filed by State Bank of India (SBI), last week. The engineers’ and pilots’ associations also moved the tribunal seeking to be made parties to the ongoing insolvency matter.   The airline said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange on June 23, ""The National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) has been initiated for Jet Airways (India) Limited as per the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.''

The sudden"," Jet Airways share price sprang a surprise today after days of thrashing after the ailing airline found itself stuck in muddy waters of debt trap invoking lenders to approach insolvency court to recover their dues. Jet Airways share, which hit a fresh 52-week low of 27 in trade today rebounded 133% amid short covering to hit an intra day high of 77.35 on BSE. The sudden rise in Jet Airways stock comes ahead of an order to be passed by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on insolvency plea filed by country's largest lender SBI. The order is expected to be passed at 5 pm today.

On NSE, Jet Airways share closed 122.21% or 40 points higher at 73.55 compared to the previous close of 33.10. Mustafa Nadeem, CEO at Epic Research said, ""There is a bounce in stock just before when the matter is going in the NCLT. The stock did jump on huge volume. When we look at the Derivatives data of Jet in Futures we believe it a merely short covering that was triggered. There is a lot of debt on the company and the list is too long. The creditors, lenders, Leasors, employees, the fleet also comprise of planes that are on rent. So we don't think there can be some big turnaround. We have seen this kind of volume before and the jump. That turned out to be a trap. It is about time that this one would also prove to be the same.""

6,Transat stock jumps above $14 as exclusive talks with Air Canada expire - The Globe and Mail,The Globe and Mail. REPORT ON BUSINESS. . . Transat stock jumps above $14 as exclusive talks with Air Canada,"This article was published more than 1 year ago. Some information in it may no longer be current.    Transat AT Inc.’s share price jumped past $14 on Wednesday, the day Air Canada’s exclusive talks to buy the airline and travel operator expired. The two companies have in been in negotiations for 30 days for a takeover that would merge Canada’s largest and third-largest airlines at $13 a share, or $520-million. Transat shares closed at $14.19 Wednesday as investors signalled their belief that Air Canada – or another buyer – will pay more than that. Montreal real estate developer Groupe Mach has proposed buying Transat for $14 a share, and on Tuesday positioned itself as a more credible bidder by dropping a condition that it receive $120-million in financing from the province of Quebec. Pierre Fitzgibbon, Quebec’s Economy Minister, said on Wednesday the provincial government’s finance arm, Investissement Quebec, told Mach it would support its bid for Transat on certain conditions, including that Mach find another investor to share the risk and that Mach be invited by the vacation company into its data room to perform due diligence. The government did not agree to commit the entire $120-million Mach requested from the government, Mr. Fitzgibbon said. The minister declined to say how much money was pledged. “It’s non-binding support so-to-speak that was made available, which is frankly the only thing we could do,” Mr. Fitzgibbon said. “It’s impossible to make a commitment when you don’t have all the data.” At least two large Transat investors have said they will oppose a sale at $13 a share. Talks between Air Canada and Transat continued on Wednesday, and could yield no deal. The companies could also agree to extend the exclusivity period, or announce the takeover. STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT A Transat spokesman said the result would be announced by Thursday morning. “There is going to be news either way,” Christophe Hennebelle said. Any deal requires approval by two-thirds of Transat shareholders, in addition to legal and government approvals. An Air Canada-Transat deal is expected to undergo strict scrutiny from Canada’s competition watchdog, given the two airlines command a combined 60-per-cent share of cross-Atlantic travel from Canada, and much of the Montreal air-travel market. Transat is Canada’s third-largest airline, with 5,000 employees and about 40 planes serving 26 countries.

7,We are learning from Jet Airways’ mistakes: IndiGo CEO’s take on Jet’s fatal move - The Financial Express,We are learning from Jet Airways’ mistakes: IndiGo CEO’s take on Jet’s fatal move. While Jet was doing great when,"Naresh Goyal-founded Jet Airways was too quick to jump in to acquire wide-bodied aircraft which “are inevitable but dangerous to implement at the present,” IndiGo’s Chief Executive Officer Ronojoy Dutta told CNBC TV18 in an interview. Speaking about the now-grounded airline and the aviation industry in general, Ronojoy Dutta said: “The airline is a very unforgiving industry and there are many paths to failure, only a few paths to success,” he said, adding that the Jet Airways is a good case study in that issue. While Jet was doing great when they focused on the narrow-bodied planes, its next step of deploying wide-bodied aircraft with a fragmented fleet was probably a mistake, Ronojoy Dutta told the news channel. Lots of money is lost very quickly when wide-bodied fleet is employed per trip, he added. The CEO said that IndiGo is learning from the mistakes made by Jet Airways. The airline which eyes international skies for expansion will deploy narrow-bodied aircraft and the international plans do not include the wide-bodied aircraft, for now, IndiGo CEO told the news channel. “We will expand internationally but carefully, cautiously and will not make the same mistakes,” he added. The recently-appointed top executive at IndiGo — India’s largest domestic carrier — also said that the airline has plans to go to neighbouring countries China, Myanmar and Vietnam. “We want to be a global player,” he said. Also commenting upon the aircraft pricing, Ronojoy Dutta said that in the aviation industry, buying aircraft at the right price is very important. Getting stuck with high-cost aircraft is an issue, Dutta said. IndiGo wants to step into Air India’s shoes While Air India was expected to become the national airline and cater to international destinations as well, it has not shown promising results. “India does not carry its traffic. The international traffic is gobbled by Thai, Lufthansa etc. What Air India was supposed to do in being the national airline of India and carrying the international traffic, it has not worked,” Ronojoy Dutta said. IndiGo hence looks to step into that and expand its market share internationally, he added.

SHARE THIS POST. Your Market View. Find News","   TORONTO, June 26, 2019 /CNW/ - Toronto Pearson this morning participated alongside the World Economic Forum (WEF), the governments of Canada and The Netherlands, and aviation industry stakeholders from both countries to announce a pilot project which will allow for paperless travel between the two countries for the first time. The Known Traveller Digital Identity (KTDI) pilot will be the first initiative to use a traveller-managed digital identity to enable paperless travel internationally.  This pilot has been enabled through a collaborative effort between government and industry, including border authorities, airports, technology providers, and airlines, to create an interoperable system for more secure and seamless travel. Along with Toronto Pearson, Air Canada, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Montréal-Trudeau International Airport and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol are participating in the trial. ""Toronto Pearson is the most connected international airport in North America and the fifth-most connected airport in the world,"" said Howard Eng, President and CEO of the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), operator of Toronto Pearson. ""We will grow to serve some 85 million passengers by the mid-2030s, and to do this successfully, collaboration, innovation, and a focus on the passenger must be our priorities. This pilot program is emblematic of industry and government's shared commitment to move people safely, securely, and efficiently."" A WEF initiative, KTDI aims to provide a more convenient and frictionless travel experience for passengers while also allowing them to have greater control over their personal data. The identity data that is usually stored on a chip on a traveller's passport will instead be securely stored and encrypted on the traveller's mobile device. Travellers will be able to manage their identity data and consent to share it with border authorities, airlines, and other pilot partners ahead of the trip. Using biometrics, the traveller will then be verified through every step of the journey until arrival at the destination without the need to use a passport, thus ensuring a more seamless travel experience.  The KTDI platform will first be integrated with partner systems and tested internally throughout 2019. The first end-to-end paperless journey is expected to take place in early 2020.

13,Jet Airways' Flying Rights With 5 Countries Temporarily Allocated To Air India: Govt,. Jet Airways' flying rights with 5 countries temporarily allocated to Air India: Govt. The minister said the domestic slots,"                                           Bilateral flying rights with five countries, which were previously allocated to Jet Airways, have now been temporarily given to Air India till the end of the summer schedule of this year, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said June 26. As Jet Airways ran out of funds, it had shut down its operations on April 17 this year which lead to a sudden rise in domestic and international airfares. As a result, the central government decided to temporarily allocate the domestic slots as well as international flying rights of Jet Airways to other airlines who could start new flights immediately and fill the supply gap. ""Bilateral rights of Jet Airways have been temporarily allocated to Air India/Air India Express till end of summer schedule 2019 for the sectors as follows - India-Dubai at 5,852 seats per week; India-Hong Kong at 1,792 seats per week; India-Qatar at 5,670 seats per week; India-Singapore at 1,620 seats per week; India-UK at 4,788 seats per week,"" Puri said in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha. The minister said the domestic slots for 22 flights, which were vacated by Jet Airways, have been allocated to Air India. These domestic Air India flights are running on the routes such as Delhi-Bhopal, Bhopal-Pune, Delhi-Raipur, Delhi-Bengaluru, Delhi-Amritsar, Chennai-Bengaluru and Chennai-Ahmedabad, he said. Before a country's airline can operate international flights to another country, the two have to negotiate and sign a ""bilateral air services agreement"", which decides how many total flights (or seats) per week can be allowed to fly from one nation to another. Once such an agreement is signed, each country is free to allocate these flying rights to its respective airlines. Even after such flying rights are allocated to an airline, it must have slots at both the airports in order to start flight operations. Slot is a date and time at which an airline's aircraft is permitted to depart or arrive at an airport.
