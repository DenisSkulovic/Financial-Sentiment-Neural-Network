1,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. United provides a glimpse of how bad the first quarter was for the industry..,"   Airline stocks sputtered on Monday after United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) released preliminary first-quarter results that came in well below expectations. Investors knew first- and second-quarter numbers would be under pressure, but United's actual numbers paint a picture of how challenging operations are for the nation's airlines. Shares of United fell 8.2% at the open, while shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) fell 7.3% and shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), and Allegiant Travel Co. (NASDAQ:ALGT) all fell more than 5%. The stocks gave back some of those losses as the trading day continued, but it looks like another tough trading session for airline investors. Airline stocks have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with travel demand off by more than 90%. The pandemic began in Asia early in the quarter but spread globally by March, meaning the first quarter was sure to be impacted. In a securities filing on Monday, United Airlines gave an idea of how bad the quarterly airline reports are going to be. United said it expects a pre-tax loss of about $2.1 billion in the quarter, significantly more than the consensus estimate for a $459 million loss. The number includes about $1 billion in special charges mostly tied to a decline in the value of United's investment in Colombia's Avianca Holdings (OTC:AVHO.Q). Avianca has been largely grounded since March 24 after Colombia and other Latin American countries shut down their air space. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. The results are bad, but the second quarter is likely to be significantly worse. United said first-quarter revenue fell 17% year over year to $8 billion. Airlines in recent weeks have said they expect revenue to fall by upwards of 90% in the second quarter, as refund requests swamp new bookings and Americans put vacation and work travel plans on hold. United said it expects to take $5 billion through the government payroll support program, including a $1.5 billion loan with an interest rate of 1% in the first five years. It also intends to apply to borrow another $4.5 billion from the U.S. Treasury as part of a separate $25 billion program, but executives have warned employees that if travel does not return by the fall, significant layoffs are possible. The entire sector is under pressure because there is","Apr 20, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/20/why-airline-shares-are-falling-today.aspx
2,Better Buy: Delta Air Lines vs. Southwest Airlines | The Motley Fool,Better Buy: Delta Air Lines vs. Southwest Airlines. Which of these top-tier airlines is best positioned for a comeback?. Industry,"   It would be a mammoth understatement to say that the past two months have been challenging for airline stocks. America's two largest airlines by market capitalization, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) have watched their share prices tumble as the number of people traveling by air has dropped precipitously. According to the Transportation Security Administration, daily U.S. passenger numbers have fallen to less than 5% of their levels a year ago. Yet while the S&P 500 has regained 13% in April due to optimism that U.S. companies broadly will be able to survive and recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, shares of Southwest and Delta have sunk back down to near their 5-year lows. Strong fundamentals and customer loyalty make Southwest and Delta, in my opinion, the two best U.S. airlines. And given the unprecedented predicament airlines find themselves in, it's worth taking a closer look at whether either can survive this crisis, and if so, which one is better positioned for a comeback. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. There are several headwinds facing airlines at the moment. First, the industry is likely to be one of the last to fully recover from the pandemic shutdown. On the existential side, companies are adapting to a ""new normal"" of working from home and communicating via streaming video meetings. That widespread adoption of virtual meetings could lead to a paradigm shift that reduces the desire for face-to-face business meetings. The fewer in-person meetings, site visits, plant visits, industry conferences, etc., there are, the less revenue there will be for the airline industry. Warren Buffet was long an opponent of investing in airlines, but a few years ago, he began to see value in the industry. In 2016, he bought stakes in Southwest, Delta, and two other airlines, and added 5 million shares to his Delta position in 2019. But in early April, he sold large portions of his Southwest and Delta holdings. One silver lining is that current low oil prices mean lower jet fuel prices, but many airlines hedge their jet fuel purchase, so oil would have to remain low for some time for the airline industry to see a significant benefit. Last year was a great demonstration of how solid management and a great balance sheet can help a company manage through rough times.

3,Don't Book A Flight With United Airlines Stock Just Yet | InvestorPlace,"Don’t Book A Flight With United Airlines Stock Just Yet. UAL's spring is coiling, so be patient and wait for"," The wholesale destruction of the aviation industry has captured the fascination of investors everywhere. Companies from Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and Jet Blue Airways (NYSE:JBLU) to American Airlines (NYSE:AAL) and United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) have seen share prices pulverized. A fresh look at UAL stock suggests it’s not worth buying yet.  But if you’re a fan of DAL, AAL, or one of the dozen other major carriers, don’t get too comfortable. My analysis of UAL applies to you as well. And that’s for a single, simple reason: all airline stocks are moving the exact same right now. In technician-speak, we would say correlations are running to one. At some point, likely in the distant future, they will rediscover their individuality, but that day isn’t today. For now, they’re all stuck together in the same leaky boat. A global pandemic has air traffic grinding to a halt and the world’s largest airlines pleading for rescue from the only entity on the planet with the power to save them – the government. Fortunately, Uncle Sam has heard their cries, and a $25 billion bailout is on its way. Those hoping for a rapid-fire recovery out of UAL stock and friends are in for a rude awakening if they think the road back will be an easy flight, though. Just look at its trajectory so far. The NYSE Arca Airline Index (NYSE:XAL) is about the best proxy for the airline industry that you’ll find. It includes the who’s who of the space among its top holdings. As a result, its chart is essentially an amalgamation of the individual charts of DAL, UAL, AAL, JBLU, and the others.  XAL has rallied off its lows, but not much. Bottom fishers have to be disappointed that airline stocks didn’t achieve more lift following the government bailout, particularly given the rosy performance out of the rest of the stock market. The S&P 500 has retraced some 50% of its bear market losses. By comparison, XAL has only regained about 15% of its lost ground. The past month has seen some stability, but I find the lack of upside follow-through disturbing and a sign that more time is needed before an uptrend takes root. The symmetrical triangle pattern is a good start, but the party won’t start until bulls can push the Index through resistance. $50 marks the spot to watch.

7,United Airlines sells $1 billion of stock in fresh move to weather pandemic | Reuters,United Airlines sells $1 billion of stock in fresh move to weather pandemic. . . . . . . .,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Tracy Rucinski 2 MIN READ (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O on Tuesday announced a public offering to raise more than $1 billion, the first major airline to sell equity to help it survive a sharp travel downturn in the coronavirus pandemic. The offer of 39.25 million shares, underwritten by Morgan Stanley and Barclays, was priced at $26.50 per share, United said in a statement, a discount of 4.9% on Tuesday’s close. Shares in United, like other airlines, have been punished by decimated travel demand, losing 67% over the past three months as the pandemic forced lockdowns in many countries. In an effort to boost capital and save costs until people start flying again, U.S. airlines have grounded fleets, raised debt, cut executive salaries, asked employees to take unpaid leaves of absence and sought government aid. United is set to receive $5 billion from the U.S. Treasury to cover payroll through Sept. 30 and has said it expects to borrow up to about $4.5 billion from a separate government package for airlines. In exchange for part of the funds, the airline must issue warrants for the Treasury to purchase shares at its April 9 closing price of $31.50. The stock offering announced Tuesday includes a 30-day option for the underwriters, Morgan Stanley and Barclays, to purchase up to 3.93 million additional shares. In a separate statement on Tuesday, United said it reached a settlement last month with Boeing Co BA.N over damages incurred in 2019, when airlines were forced to cancel flights due to the 737 MAX grounding that followed two fatal crashes. It did not disclose any financial details. United on Monday said it expects to report a pre-tax loss of about $2.1 billion for the first quarter.

8,United shares drop after company announces fresh stock offering as coronavirus saps revenue,United shares drop after company announces fresh stock offering as coronavirus drives travel demand to ‘essentially zero’. News Tips. CNBC,"United shares fell close to 2% in extended trading after the airline said it’s planning a fresh stock offering, the latest measure by a carrier to raise money as the coronavirus devastates travel demand. Shares  The Chicago-based carrier said it is planning to sell 39.25 million shares, which would be worth slightly more than $1 billion at Tuesday’s closing price of $27.88.  United’s shares are down nearly 70% this year, and the new offering highlights the lengths airlines are going to to raise money as the pandemic continues to sap revenue. The airline’s competitors have also tumbled by a similar amount this year as the disease and measures to stop it from spreading kept passengers home. “Travel demand is essentially zero and shows no sign of improving in the near-term,” United’s CEO Oscar Munoz and its president, Scott Kirby, who takes the reins next month, told employees last week. The airline on Monday disclosed that a $2.1 billion loss in the first quarter of the year, its largest since 2008. The carrier and its competitors are scheduled to report full quarterly earnings in the coming days. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Also, with the uncertainty moving forward in the aviation industry, it might be a better idea to research each individual airlines balance sheets/financials in order to predict which one(s) have the best odds of surviving and recovering rather than just splitting the money evenly between four. Personally, I'm only willing to put my money in Delta or Southwest, but I'm looking elsewhere in the market atm because it's gonna be a while before the airlines fully recover imo. I’m personally buying UAL and DAL Little to risky for me, I’m doing 600 between AC and either American or Delta airline (top airline company of Canada and U.S) if either one gets a bailout, and economy resumes to normal, profits would outweigh the loss on the other Ya might be a little risky but might be worth it who knows      ","Apr 21, 2020",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g59dg6/airline/

USD/JPY.,"                                                   The airlines are high-risk stocks here with passenger traffic down over 95% and American Airlines (AAL) is one of the riskiest in the sector. The ability of the airline sector to obtain government aid to cover payroll costs is a huge positive for the sector. The move eliminates the direst outcomes for the sector making American Airlines a risky way to play a rebound in air travel demand. Big Government Grant On April 14, the airline sector and the U.S. Treasury Department agreed to a deal on the Payroll Support Program part of the CARES act providing $25 billion worth of aid to the passenger air transport sector. With the largest employee base, American Airlines obtained the largest deal at $5.8 billion. The airline had pre-virus monthly payroll expenses of $1.2 billion. As shareholders, the deal was disappointing in that 30% of the “grant” was via a $1.7 billion low-interest loan. Only $4.1 billion of the grant is free money, if the airline doesn’t lay off employees prior to October 1 along with agreeing to restrictions on executive compensation and the elimination of capital returns. The deal wasn’t the best outcome for shareholders, but the move eliminates the dire outcomes. The airline is now able to remain ready for an eventual rebound in air travel with only a 3% hit to equity via the warrants issued to the Treasury. Besides, Delta Air Lines (DAL) announced over 35,000 employees out of a base of 90,000 employees have already accepted unpaid leave options. The airlines have the potential to reduce costs closer to the levels of the grants making the loan portion of the grant usable for covering operating losses. Deep Value Sprinkled With Risk Last year, American Airlines generated over $3.7 billion of operating profits while taking a large hit from having to ground 737 Max planes. The stock has a market value down to only $4.7 billion leaving a major question of when or if the airline can ever return to previous profit levels.

Delta continues to underperform the broader market by a wide margin. The stock is still down more than 60% from its 2020 high and is up “just” 23.5% from the March lows. While a rally of more than 20% from a stock’s low is generally viewed positively, consider that the rally lags that of the broader market, which is still up around 27% from the lows. So not only has Delta fallen almost twice as hard, but it’s rebounded less than the overall market thus far. Those are hallmark signs of a weak stock and it’s not a promising sign coming into the company’s quarterly results, which are due up before the open on Wednesday. On the plus side, Delta’s outperforming most of its peers, including American Airlines  (AAL) - Get Report, United Airlines  (UAL) - Get Report and Spirit Airlines  (SAVE) - Get Report. The group needs federal aid as it struggles in an environment plagued by the coronavirus.   Let’s look at the charts of Delta Air Lines to see if we can get an idea of the stock's key technical areas once the quarterly numbers are out. Daily chart of Delta stock. Chart courtesy of Stockcharts.com In mid-March, Delta stock bottomed below $20, ripping higher and rallying to $35 in just a few days.

Remember, a That may not remain the case though should Delta issue a drastically disappointing quarterly update on Wednesday.First, the stock has put in a higher low after pulling back in early April. Second, support seems to be coming into play, with buyers thus far willing to step in and buy the stock near $22. That may not remain the case though should Delta issue a drastically disappointing quarterly update on Wednesday. If that’s the case and Delta stock breaks below $22, it puts the $20 mark and the March lows in play at $19.10. That could send shares down into the teens as Delta probes for a new low.

The difference is,"      Ryan Vanzo | April 20, 2020 | More on: AC CHR Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock has been pummelled during the market crash. Even after a slight rebound, shares are still more than 60% off their highs. Value investors are jumping in, but there’s a TSX airline stock that’s even better. This alternative to Air Canada stock is much smaller, with a market valuation of just $450 million, which is likely a big reason why shares have fallen more than the competition since the coronavirus pandemic began. Year-to-date, this stock is down nearly 70%. While you may be compelled to buy Air Canada stock, you should consider buying the superior option: Chorus Aviation Inc (TSX:CHR). Air Canada is a quality stock. Before the pandemic began, shares had risen by 1,800% in just eight years. Revenues and profits were on the rise, and the company commanded a dominant domestic market share. Along with WestJet Airlines, just two carriers accounted for roughly 70% of Canada’s flight traffic. There’s a good chance that you’ve taken an Air Canada flight. But have you flown with Chorus Aviation? Your initial answer is likely no, but I wouldn’t be too sure. Chorus Aviation isn’t a pure-play airline. Its two major segments are regional aviation services and aircraft leasing. Let’s dive into both. Its regional aviation services are conducted through its Jazz and Voyageur subsidiaries. These businesses operate charter flights, but also more specialized services like medical and government transportation. More important, they work with Air Canada directly to service some of its regional routes. If you’ve ever flown on a smaller, regional flight in Canada, you’ve likely flown on a Chorus Aviation plane, even if the carrier name was Air Canada. The company operates nearly 80% of all Air Canada regional flights. In essence, Chorus Aviation is a secret version of Air Canada. The other business segment is aircraft leasing, generating a smaller amount of profit than regional aviation services, but it’s still a money maker. Rather than buying aircraft outright, airlines can enter a long-term contract to lease the plane from Chorus. This segment now operates 64 aircraft around the world, with $940 million in committed revenues. What exactly makes Chorus Aviation a better buy than Air Canada? A few things. First, the company could see demand for its services grow over the coming years, even with the coronavirus pandemic","Apr 20, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/20/dont-buy-air-canada-tsxac-buy-this-stock-instead/
