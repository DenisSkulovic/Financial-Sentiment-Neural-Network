3,Why Shares of Airline Stocks Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Airline Stocks Are Falling Today. A failure in Europe and a new estimate of lost revenue from,"   The airline sector was hit by COVID-19 coronavirus-related concerns again on Thursday, with shares of Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) each down more than 10% in early trading. The losses extended well beyond those two, however, with shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) all down more than 5%. The industry seems certain to be hit hard by an outbreak-related slowdown in travel. But until the extent of that hit can be quantified, trying to call a bottom in these stocks is like trying to catch a falling knife. Airline stocks have been in a downward spiral in recent weeks as it has become more apparent that concerns about the novel coronavirus would stifle near-term demand for travel. This realization has called into question whether demand will materialize during typically peak travel times including spring break, Easter, and summer vacation. Shares of Spirit, Hawaiian, and American are now down about 40% year to date, and many other airline stocks are not far behind. The sell-off has gotten worse as airlines begin to take actions that confirm investor fears about demand are accurate. Late Wednesday United said it would cut international flying by 20% and domestic flights by 10% in April, while on Thursday morning Southwest revised its capacity estimate downward saying it has seen a ""significant decline"" in demand in recent days. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. On Thursday the International Air Transport Association estimated the coronavirus could cost airlines about $113 billion in lost 2020 revenue worldwide, well above the $29 billion estimate it had forecast just weeks ago. Investors were also likely worried after British regional carrier Flybe ceased operations late Wednesday, the first major airline to fail due to the slowdown. Spirit is under particular pressure because that company had originally forecast aggressive growth in 2020, and its shares had been priced in anticipation for that growth. American, meanwhile, is seen as the most vulnerable of the major U.S. airlines due to its high debt burden. American had intended to use profits in 2020 to pay down that debt, but it now appears likely the company's turnaround is going to take longer than anticipated. Hawaiian is a niche airline both exposed to U.S. vacation travel and more reliant than any other U.S.-based carrier on Asia travel.

4,Warren Buffett Bets Big on Airlines | ETF Trends,"Warren Buffett Bets Big on Airlines. Airline Stocks on Sale, Most Discounted Since 9/11. Is More QE on the Way?.","Ever on the hunt for a great bargain, billionaire investor Warren Buffett boosted his company’s stake in Delta Air Lines once again. Berkshire Hathaway acquired some 976,000 Delta shares last week for roughly $45.3 million, according to a filing on Monday, raising its total holdings to 17.9 million shares. This was enough to bring Buffett’s ownership of the U.S. long-haul carrier up to more than 11 percent. Once a critic of airline stocks, Buffett has become one of their greatest champions, noting the industry’s strong fundamentals and the fact that it’s protected by an economic moat. Accumulating shares now appears to be a strategic move to capitalize on lower fuel costs—Brent crude oil is down 30 percent so far this year—as well as coronavirus-impacted travel, which has depressed airline stock prices. Buffett isn’t alone in thinking airlines look like a steal right now. In a note to clients this week, Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent maintained his Buy ratings on Delta, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines, writing that “if coronavirus concerns fade in the coming weeks and the U.S. is able to avoid recession, this scenario could see a recovery in ex-Asia demand, which could lead airline stock prices and earnings streams to stabilize.” What’s more, the domestic airline industry could soon receive fiscal stimulus in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic. Speaking to various business news networks on Friday, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow hinted that the U.S. government is considering “timely and targeted micro-measures” for certain industries, including airlines, hospitality and agricultural. It’s unclear at the moment what those measures might look like. Kudlow ruled out a large-scale economic stimulus package similar to the one passed in response to the global financial crisis, calling the idea a “budget buster.” As one the most exposed industries to global travel disruptions, airlines have seen a deeper selloff than the market and now look like an attractive bargain. So far, COVID-19 has had a far greater impact on global airline stocks than the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic did. The chart below shows the daily percent change of the NYSE Arca Global Airlines Index starting on the day of the first reported incident of either infection—November 15, 2002 in the case of SARS, December 31, 2019 in the case of COVID-19.

Friday, March 6, 2020 - 12:17   As investors try to work out what could be the short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak upon the global economy, corporate profits and therefore share prices one sector in particular has taken a fearsome battering. The global airline sector’s market capitalisation has dropped by $40.6 billion, or 25%, in the last month alone. The sector’s valuation now stands at a five-year low and 45% below its January 2018 peak of $205 billion, as benchmarked by the S&P Global 1200 airlines index.  Source: Refinitiv data This feels like a return to the bad old days, when airlines used to go bust at the drop of a hat and the industry attracted the ridicule of legendary investor Warren Buffett, rather than his support – three of the top 15 holdings in Berkshire Hathaway’s equity portfolio are now airline stocks, in the form of Delta, Southwest and United Continental. It is also a massive contrast to just three years ago when Doug Parker, the chairman and CEO of American Airlines, went so far as to argue that the industry was indeed different this time as he commented: ‘I don’t think that we’re ever going to lose money again. We have an industry that’s going to be profitable in good times and bad.’ Such words came perilously close to saying ‘this time it’s different,’ a phrase described by Sir John Templeton as ‘the four most expensive words in the English language,’ and right now it looks like Sir John’s words are offering more protection to portfolio builders than those of Mr Parker. Granted, the S&P Global 1200 airlines kept rising after Mr Parker’s bullish assessment – but only for three months. Since then, the airline industry has been troubled by overcapacity, as new entrants and established players alike have targeted a bigger slice of the perceived profit bonanza, bizarre weather patterns, sluggish economies and now the Coronavirus outbreak. Even before COVID19 the industry had started to struggle, weighed down by its own optimistic capacity expansion and increased price competition. FlyBe’s collapse in the UK is just the latest in a long list of recent failures that also includes Thomas Cook and Monarch, as well as Denmark’s Primera, Cyprus’ Cobalt, France’s XL Airways and Aigle, Iceland’s Wow Air and Slovenia’s Adria.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Laurence Fletcher in London Lansdowne Partners, one of Europe’s biggest but most publicity-shy hedge funds, has suffered the latest in a series of mis-steps after its bets on airlines suffered during the coronavirus-driven market slump of the past two weeks. The Mayfair-based firm, which manages about $15bn in assets and was once widely viewed as the gold standard in equity investing, has lost more than 16 per cent this year in its Developed Markets Long Only fund, including a 10 per cent loss last month, according to numbers sent to investors and seen by the Financial Times. Its flagship Developed Markets hedge fund, meanwhile, is down 11 per cent this year after losing almost 6 per cent last month. Lansdowne declined to comment. The declines continue a challenging period for the firm. In January, it experienced losses on bullish bets on the UK, which it had said was “structurally in a very good position”. The latest losses come in a brutal period for equity markets. Last week the S&P 500 index of US stocks slumped 11.5 per cent and a recovery this week proved shortlived, hitting many hedge funds hard. However, macro funds such as Andrew Law’s Caxton Associates and Greg Coffey’s Kirkoswald, which have been holding bonds, have made large gains. Lansdowne’s losses are likely to have been at least partly driven by its bets on airlines, which have been badly affected by the impact of the coronavirus on travel bookings. The S&P airlines index has dropped by more than a fifth since the start of February. In a recent letter to investors, seen by the Financial Times, Lansdowne wrote that large airlines were “massively” undervalued and represented an attractive medium-term investment. About one-quarter of Lansdowne’s bets on rising prices were held in airlines at the end of last year, the letter said. Lansdowne’s Developed Markets hedge fund, which tries to pick winning stocks to back and losing stocks to bet against, lost money in both 2016 and 2018. Last year, it finished only marginally in the black. The Long-Only fund, however, which does not bet on falling stocks, has fared better during the rising markets of recent years, gaining 18.6 per cent in 2019. Both that and the flagship fund are managed by Peter Davies, who was best man at former chancellor George Osborne’s wedding, and Jonathon Regis.

JETS seeks to track the performance of the U.S. Global Jets Index, which is composed of the exchange-listed common stock (or depository receipts) of U.S. and international passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers, airports, and terminal services companies across the globe. “Airline stocks are bearing the brunt of the markets’ coronavirus fears,” reports Al Root for Barron’s. “That makes sense, to some extent. Global health fears and events such as the 9/11 attacks have, in the past, sent airline traffic plunging, and people on planes, after all, is the lifeblood of the industry. Travel always bounced back, but not before airlines started to buckle under the weight of their debt loads.” There’s never a good time for an epidemic, but the emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak dealt a blow to airlines operating internationally because China moved to curb Lunar New Year festivities and harsh restrictions on travel to and from the country are expected to crimp first-quarter profits for many JETS components. That after the industry was profitable, broadly speaking, each year over the past decade. What’s more, China’s travel industry experienced a strong December, making the timing of the coronavirus outbreak all the more burdensome. “China’s transportation industry expanded steadily in December 2019, an industry index showed Wednesday,” a China.org.cn report noted. “The China Transportation Services Index","Mar 5, 2020",https://etfdb.com/multi-asset-channel/airline-stocks-have-been-grounded-but-etf-may-take-off/

11,Is It Time To Buy Or To Sell Airline Stocks? | Investing.com,Is It Time To Buy Or To Sell Airline Stocks?. Value in Beaten-Down Stocks. Related Articles. . . . .," One of the most-exposed sectors of the economy to the coronavirus outbreak is the airline industry. The extent of damage to this vital part of our economy threatens to be huge as people cancel their leisure trips, while companies and governments globally put curbs on their workers’ travel plans. Revenue losses for global airlines will amount to $63 billion this year, even if the outbreak is contained, and could surge to $113 billion if it spreads further, the International Air Transport Association estimated in a report Thursday. The latter “would be on a scale equivalent to what the industry experienced in the Global Financial Crisis,” the industry trade body said. As the frontline stocks that take the first hit from recessionary pressures, airlines are massively underperforming in this month’s slump. From the equity markets’ record high on Feb. 19, U.S. and European airline stocks had fallen 21% and 30% respectively by the end of last week, compared with a 14% drop for both regions’ headline indexes.  Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) warned investors yesterday that the outbreak will cost the U.S. carrier up to $300 million during the first quarter. “In recent days, the company has experienced a significant decline in customer demand, as well as an increase in trip cancellations, which is assumed to be attributable to concerns relating to reported cases of COVID-19,” the airline said. The shares of Southwest dropped 3.6% yesterday to $45.28. While the world’s largest airlines take the hit from the spread of the coronavirus, there are investors who are finding value in the beaten-down airline stocks. Their theory is that the virus-related fear can’t permanently damage these companies' ability to make money and they will be back roaring once the outbreak is contained. With interest rates falling quickly and governments ready to provide the stimulus, some investors are betting on the long-term health of the U.S. economy, which has been on a solid growth path with a low rate of unemployment for several years. With stocks close to their cheapest ever relative to the broader equity market, airlines offer a cheap trade for those who want to buy the dip. This is especially true for the U.S., where IATA expects the impact of the outbreak to be lower, and where most carriers are financially healthy.

Impact on financial performance","UPDATED 10 MONTHS AGO Airline stocks fell significantly on Thursday. More coronavirus cases led to travel restrictions and a big drop in demand. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stocks declined by 13.4% and 13.3%, respectively, on Thursday. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) fell 10.8%, 12.5%, 7.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. The International Air Transport Association expects global revenue losses for the passenger business to be $63 billion–$113 billion. The trade association revised its previous loss estimate of $29.3 billion issued on February 20. Since the coronavirus outbreak started, travel and airline industry stocks have been hit by cancelations or postponed travel plans. According to the latest figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University, there are 98,704 total confirmed cases of coronavirus globally, including 233 cases in the US. Meanwhile, there have been 3,383 deaths globally due to coronavirus. Airline executives met with President Trump on March 3 to discuss lower travel demand and measures related to the impact of the virus outbreak. As of Thursday, American Airlines, United Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Alaska Air, Delta Air Lines, Spirit, and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stocks have declined 44.1%, 41.4%, 26%, 35.9%, 23.0%, 46.6%, and 16.2%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis. Airlines in other countries have also struggled due to the coronavirus. UK-based Flybe entered “administration”—similar to bankruptcy in the US. As a result, the company has grounded all of its flights. As reported by CNBC, United Airlines cut its April international flight schedule by 20%. Meanwhile, the airline cut its US and Canada flight schedule by 10%. The company will suspend new hiring until at least June 30. United Airlines made the decisions due to lower demand amid the coronavirus outbreak. The company also withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance due to the uncertainty involved. Major companies in the US and other countries have canceled key conferences. Instead, the companies will hold webcasts. Companies have also been asking employees to work from home and avoid non-essential traveling. In an SEC filing dated February 24, United Airlines disclosed that it sees an almost 100% drop in the near-term travel demand to China. The company also added that the near-term demand for the rest of its Trans-Pacific routes has declined by 75%. JetBlue plans to cut its capacity by 5% in the near term.

Related Articles.","Travel stocks have been obliterated in recent weeks, caught in freefalls that could eventually trigger a round of bankruptcies. Airline and cruise ship companies have taken the brunt of selling pressure, which is now expanding into lodging, casinos, and big travel portals. While there's no end in sight, long-term price patterns could offer useful road maps for bottom fishers and shareholders stuck with catastrophic losses. U.S. airline carriers have struggled for years to book consistent profits, caught in the cross-currents of skyrocketing fuel prices, an economic collapse, and poor management. In fact, many sector charts you're looking at right now were created after major bankruptcies and mergers by carriers who couldn't survive on their own. While they've entered this crisis in excellent cash positions, it won't take long to put lethal stress on their financial operations. Keep that mind if you're fishing for a tradable low in the airline sector in coming months. Getting caught in a bankruptcy filing can kill an investment account, tying up capital while the courts look at the facts and consider the rights of creditors. Also understand that demand may not return to pre-crisis levels after the outbreak runs its course, because business and consumer habits may be changed permanently. For example, companies and corporations around the world have told employees to stop traveling, forcing them to utilize internet conferencing applications to conduct business. It's entirely possible that corporate bean counters discover that online alternatives provide most of the benefits of business travel at a fraction of the cost. It's also carbon-neutral, allowing them to taut their contribution in the fight against global warming. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL) has been the sector's strongest performer in recent years, even though the stock didn't gain a penny between 2018 and start of 2020. It broke down from an 18-month trading range in January, entering a vertical decline that has now stretched into a three-and-a-half-year low. Ominously, the decline cut through the 2017 low in the upper $50s ""like butter,"" highlighting near-panic price action that could eventually reach the 2016 low at $37.41. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) broke out above 2015 resistance at $103 in 2016, entering a healthy uptrend that topped out near $135 in the first quarter of 2018.

15,Buffet Bets Big With $45.3 Million Delta Share Purchase - Simple Flying,Buffet Bets Big With $45.3 Million Delta Share Purchase. Airline stocks are tumbling. Why did Berkshire purchase the shares now.," With the global travel sector being heavily impacted by the ongoing coronavirus, many decided to sell off their airline shares, dropping prices by up to 30%. Warren Buffet spotted an opportunity in the selloff and decided to do the opposite, purchasing $45.3 million worth of Delta’s stock. Many investors fear the impact that the global halt in travel will have on airlines. The key reason is the naturally weak liquidity of the sector coming from high fixed costs and low margins. The worries seem legitimate. IATA’s data from January has already showcased the possible impact of the virus. Passenger demand growth in January was one the slowest in recent years, even despite the fact that the outbreak really started in February. The prolonged stall in ticket sales could lead to bankruptcies, an example of which we witnessed yesterday when Flybe went bankrupt. Even though the pandemic was not the underlying cause, it definitely was a tipping point. At the moment of writing, Delta Air Lines’ stock is down by 27% from its January 2020 peak. Warren Buffet is known for his successful investing approach, which made him the fourth-richest person on Earth. He calculates the intrinsic value of the firm and compares it to the stock market price. If the stock market price is significantly below his valuation, he buys. So, it seems that the current valuation of Delta is below what he believes is the correct one. According to the SEC filing, on the 27th of February Berkshire bought 976,507 shares for an average price of $46.40. At the time of writing, the stock is trading below $45 (down 8% for the day). It is not the first time that Buffet decided to purchase some of Delta’s stock. Back in 2016, Berkshire started acquiring multiple airline stocks, including those of Delta. In fact, Berkshire now owns 71.9 million shares, or about 11.2 percent of the entire company, which is around $3.2 billion. Berkshire owns a higher stake in Delta than anyone else. Interestingly, in 2016 when Berkshire started acquiring airline shares, Delta Air Lines was not the only airline chosen by the firm. According to SEC’s 13F file, the firm holds a 10% stake in American Airlines (worth $700 million), a 10.4% stake in Southwest Airlines ($2.4 billion) and an 8.8% stake in United Airlines ($1.1 billion).

Pareto Securities cut its rating on the airline’s stock, saying it was concerned about weak cash reserves and the risk that it may have to issue new shares to shore up its finances. ABG Sundal Collier also cut its rating on the stock, from hold to sell, saying the firm was low on cash and in danger of breaching its loan covenants in the second quarter of 2020. Norwegian Air said on Friday it had sold over two-thirds of its available seats for March and that the situation was “challenging” and “changing constantly”. Analysts have warned that Norwegian, which has expanded the low-cost carrier model to long-haul flights, could be particularly vulnerable due to its high debts. ABG Sundal Collier forecasts Norwegian will have a cash balance at the end of the first quarter of 1.2 billion crowns and at the end of the second quarter of 0.9 billion crowns. “Too low, in our view. This means we expect Norwegian to raise new equity,” it said.

Debts and liabilities amounted to 81.2 billion Norwegian crowns ($8.79 billion) at the end of 2019, while cash and cash equivalents stood at 3.1 billion crowns.

Pareto Securities cut its rating on the airline’s stock, saying it was concerned about weak cash reserves and the risk it may have to issue new shares to shore up its finances. Norwegian Air declined to comment. Analysts have warned that Norwegian, which has expanded the low-cost carrier model to long-haul, could be particularly vulnerable due to its high debt levels. The airline has already raised 5.4 billion Norwegian crowns via three share issues in two years, as well as a convertible bond, to help shore up its finances. The airline’s shares hit a 15-year low on Friday, down 95% from their 2015 peak, and the company’s market capitalisation is now 1.95 billion Norwegian crowns ($211 million). Debts and liabilities amounted to 81.2 billion Norwegian crowns ($8.79 billion) at the end of 2019, while cash and cash equivalents stood at 3.1 billion crowns. In 2018, Norwegian rebuffed takeover offers from British Airways’ parent company IAG, which has since said it was no longer interested in buying the ailing carrier. Norwegian’s convertible bonds have so-called covenants linked to the finances of a key subsidiary, Arctic Aviation Assets (AAA), which must keep its book equity and debt levels within certain minimum levels. Norwegian scrapped its 2020 earnings outlook and cut some transatlantic flights on Thursday, blaming the coronavirus outbreak. At 1342 GMT, Norwegian Air’s shares were down 25.5% at 11.80 Norwegian crowns ($1.27).

Continue reading to find out how detrimental the coronavirus could get for airline stocks. Mar 6, 2020  The airline stocks had been the first to decline as the Covid19 virus started spreading beyond China and they have now been the hardest hit.  The “US. Global Jets ETF (JETS)”  is down some 32% in the past three weeks, which is nearly three times worse than the broader “SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)” 12% correction over the same time period.  While there is no sign travel will return back to normal anytime soon, in fact, it will probably get worse in the coming weeks, it seems investors might be trying to find a glimmer of bluer skies for the sector.  In trading, the saying  “it’s always darkest before the dawn” translates to “reversals often occur when traders and investors are most afraid they won’t. 7 ""SAFE HAVEN"" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent Times In real-time, of course, it’s extremely difficult to know when those moments are occurring, and it’s even more of a challenge to put on a trade. But when prices reach levels that allow you to clearly define risk and potential reward, it can be easier to make an objective decision. Airline stocks look like they are trying to have that moment today as JETS and several of the major carriers have seen a big reversal and were actually up on the day even as SPY was still down over 2% at midday.  In technical analyst terminology, such price action creates a “hammer” or “green candle” which often identifies important turning points.   While some smaller and foreign airline stocks which don’t have strong balance sheets and are seeing a near standstill in travel might struggle and face the possibility of bankruptcy the major U.S. based carriers will be able to make it through the storm.  Assuming travel begins to normalize by the summer a few of the airlines are starting to look attractive from both fundamental valuation measures and technical levels.  “Southwest (LUV)” which is mostly domestic travel within the U.S. just touched the low near $45 it hit during the December 2018 sell-off.
