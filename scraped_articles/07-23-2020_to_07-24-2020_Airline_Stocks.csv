0,Why Airline Stocks Are Higher Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Stocks Are Higher Today. Earnings season is going better than some had feared.. What happened. So what. Now,"   Airlines are in the green on Thursday, a down day for broader markets, as investors are slowly warming to the sector as earnings season continues. The companies are posting losses in the second quarter, as expected, but all appear to have clear plans to ride out the coronavirus pandemic without running out of cash. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) traded up as much as 10.9% mid-day on Thursday, while shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) peaked at up 9.2%, Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) gained 7%, and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) traded up 5.5%. The sector gave back some of those gains as the afternoon went on, but all four airlines were up as of 3:30 p.m. EST, even as the S&P 500 was down more than 1.4%. Airlines have been hit hard by the pandemic, with travel demand all but evaporating in April and only recovering slightly in the months since. Industry second quarter revenue is down 80% or more year over year, and with new cases spiking in many parts of the country, airlines are planning on shrinking schedules further as summer ends. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Investors know the airlines are going to lose money for at least the next few quarters. The question is, do the companies have the wherewithal to ride out the pandemic without burning through cash reserves? And while nothing is certain, earnings season so far has added to confidence levels that the industry is stronger than initially feared. United, American, and Spirit all reported earnings in the last 24 hours, and none of them gave any reason for investors to believe the sky is falling. Delta released earnings last week that were well-received by investors, and seems to be getting a fresh lift on Thursday as a new round of earnings reports are digested. Bankruptcy still isn't completely off the table, because we don't know how long the pandemic will last or what the economy will look like once it is finally over. The airlines have done good work adding to their cash reserves but no company can survive this environment indefinitely, and even when it is over it will take years to rebuild industry balance sheets bruised by added debt. At best the industry is facing a multi-year turnaround, with travel demand not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022 at the earliest.

2,• Chart: Airline Stocks Still Far Below Cruising Altitude | Statista,AIRLINE INDUSTRY. Airline Stocks Still Far Below Cruising Altitude. . . . . . . . . . . .,"                                        Both American Airlines and Southwest Airlines saw their share price sinking in early trading on Thursday after reporting second quarter results that show the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on passenger airlines. The industry has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with each of America’s four largest carriers losing between 44 percent (Southwest) and 69 percent (United Airlines) of their stock market value within a month between February 20 and March 20. After recovering some of the losses in late March, airline stocks went into steep descent again, bottoming out on May 15. As the outbreak seemed to be under control in late May, and passengers gradually returned to the skies, airline shares took off, with American, Delta, United and Southwest gaining 125, 93, 144 and 70 percent, respectively, between said May 15 and June 8. The recent resurgence in case numbers has dashed hopes of a quick recovery, however, as passenger demand remains far below usual levels. In its latest letter to shareholders, United Airlines said that it now ""expects demand to remain suppressed until the availability of a widely accepted treatment and/or vaccine for COVID-19,"" which could be well into next year.

9,AAL Stock: Why Investors Should Avoid American Airlines for Now | InvestorPlace,Why Investors Should Avoid American Airlines for Now. AAL stock will face more selling pressure as passenger traffic falls and," Hovering nicely above 52-week lows, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is at elevated risks of falling if short-sellers have their way. AAL stock has a short float of about 34.4%. Bears are betting that the airline will not stem losses fast enough to stay in business. With more than 4.3 million positive tests of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., the airline industry’s passenger growth risks stalling. At any time, the Centers for Disease Control may issue a warning on cross-state traveling. This would hurt American Airlines’ passenger traffic. How dire does American Airlines look in the near-term? American Airlines warned that 25,000 jobs are at risk of getting cut. It urged staff to take a buyout or early retirement. By fall, it may have to cut more than 20,000 staff because the quick rebound in travel demand is delayed because of the resurgence in Covid-19 cases. The company said, “with infection rates increasing, and several states reestablishing quarantine restrictions, demand for air travel is slowing again.” If American cuts jobs, so might United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL). Other competitors may follow in response to a severe glut with flight supply and not enough demand. Driving the weakness ahead is the failure of the U.S. to stop Covid-19 from spreading again. Still, the government is not the only reason for the virus count increasing. People who do not practice physical distancing or wearing a mask at all times, especially inside, may have worsened the problem. The economy, especially travel, leisure and hospitality will suffer the most. American’s stock could re-visit 52-week lows as investors give up on the short-term recovery narrative. American’s job-cut plan will save money but hurt employee morale. The nearly 20% workforce cut will disrupt operations, worsen customer service levels, and reduce customer loyalty. American reports quarterly results on July 23, as will Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). The poor results will add no new insight for investors. Bears will expect weak revenue compared to last year. Expectations are high that American will forecast a weak recovery and will not expect to run at break-even in the near term. Investors may look at Transportation Security Administration traveler throughput. For example, traveler traffic is cycling between the 650,000 to 750,000 range daily. Daily traffic is approaching the 1 million level but to sustain it, daily virus infection rates in the U.S. need to fall. American’s traffic forecast may give investors some hope.

10,Is United Airlines Stock a Risky Bet for Investors?,Is United Airlines Stock a Risky Bet for Investors?. Analysts’ recommendations and target price. Growth projections for United Airlines. Stock,"UPDATED 5 MONTHS AGO United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) stock fell 2.4% in pre-market trading at 7:00 AM ET today. The stock fell amid fears about a second wave of COVID-19 infections. A second wave could delay the economic recovery. United Airlines has been losing nearly $40 million a day. United Airlines plans to furlough about 36,000 of its workers due to weaker demand and travel restrictions amid the pandemic. The furloughs could impact nearly 2,250 pilots, 15,000 flight attendants, 5,500 maintenance workers, and 11,000 airport staffers.  According to a MarketWatch report, “United told employees Wednesday that not everyone who gets a layoff notice will be furloughed. The company said job losses could be reduced if enough employees accept buyouts or early retirement by a deadline next week.” The report also said, “The buyouts come at a price too, however. United said it would take a $300 million charge in the second quarter to cover voluntary departures so far. The company said it was unable to estimate the cost of workforce reductions for the rest of the year.” At 7:00 AM ET today, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stocks fell 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. The Dow futures fell 0.29%, while the S&P futures fell 0.14%.  Among the 19 analysts tracking United Airlines stock, two recommend a “strong buy,” six recommend a “buy,” and 11 recommend a “hold.” None of the analysts recommend a “sell.” Analysts’ mean 12-month target price on the stock is $41.20, which implies a 26.7% gain from the current level of $32.53. The consensus target price for the stock has risen from $38.00 in June—a growth of 8.4%. United Airlines’ business has been crippled by the COVID-19 outbreak. The company swung to a first-quarter net loss of $1.7 billion or $6.86 per share from net income of $292 million or $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the net special items, the adjusted net loss was $639 million or $2.57 per share compared to an adjusted net income of $309 million or $1.15 per share in the same quarter a year ago.  United Airlines’ total sales declined 16.8% YoY (year-over-year) to $8.0 billion in the first quarter. However, analysts expected the company to report a non-GAAP EPS of -$3.47 on revenue of $8.2 billion in the first quarter.

11,Has Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Finally Bottomed? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Has Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Finally Bottomed?. Is the bottom in with,"      Joey Frenette | July 23, 2020 | More on: BA AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) looks to have formed a technical bottom in the mid-teens, but with such a profound disruption to its operating cash flows, things could get worse for the airlines before they get any better, as their business models are looking quite uneconomical amid this horrific pandemic. While the broader markets have (mostly) recovered from the coronavirus crash, a bear-case scenario, which may entail a brutal second wave of COVID-19 infections, could easily send airline stocks falling below its support levels, even with the unprecedented backing by central banks around the world. Sure, most stocks have likely already put the bottom in thanks to the “Fed put,” but the airlines are an entirely different beast. They’re sitting at ground zero of this crisis, and one must realize that there’s a realistic chance some of them may not survive if worse comes to worst and government-mandated shutdowns drive revenues to zero, as liquidity reserves dry up. Warren Buffett wants nothing to do with U.S. airline stocks amid the pandemic for a reason. They face a potentially dire fate if an effective COVID-19 vaccine doesn’t land as quickly as most expect. Just because Buffett has lost confidence doesn’t mean you should, especially if you’re a young investor who can stomach the turbulence. Some of the more optimistic pundits see a vaccine being approved at year-end. Others don’t forecast the advent of a vaccine until the middle of 2021. Given the unpredictable nature of biology, there’s also a chance that a vaccine may not be available for broader distribution until late 2021 or even 2022. If that’s the case, even Air Canada, which has a stellar liquidity position (and less leverage than its U.S. peers), could stand to fall into single-digit territory. Of course, promising news on vaccine developments could be a needle mover for airline stocks. But one must not discount the unfathomable amount of stress that the airlines will suffer for the duration of this pandemic. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun isn’t ruling out a major airline bankruptcy by year-end. And although I don’t think Air Canada is at risk of bankruptcy given its superior balance sheet relative to most other airlines, the entire basket of airline stocks will likely go down together if it turns out we’re farther away from a vaccine than","Jul 23, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/07/23/has-air-canada-tsxac-stock-finally-bottomed/

So, if you haven’t maxed out and have room for $3,000, investing in these top TSX stocks could be a smart move. These TSX stocks continue to perform well and have tailwinds to outgrow the broader markets over time and generate stellar tax-free gains. Cargojet (TSX:CJT) is a top airline stock and has the potential to rise 10 times in 10 years. Investors need to know that Cargojet’s performance is not related to passenger volumes, which is why its stock is up over 50% this year, while shares of Air Canada have plunged over 65%. Higher oil prices hardly have an impact on its profitability as it recovers increased costs through fuel charges. The company provides critical and on-time air cargo services and continues to enjoy steady demand, irrespective of challenges plaguing the airline industry. Cargojet has retained all of its major customers over the past several years and has steadily increased capacity, network, fleet size, and staff. Further, the addition of new customers and higher demand from e-commerce companies should accelerate its growth. Its revenues are growing nicely over several quarters. Meanwhile, its EBITDAR margins have continued to expand, thanks to its ability to drive revenues and optimize costs. Cargojet’s resilient business, growing demand for its services, prudent cost-control measures, and strong cash flows provide a solid base for a big bull run over the next decade. Shopify (TSX:SHOP)(NYSE:SHOP) stock is a multi-bagger and is the top TSX stock when it comes to multiplying the value of your investment. The company’s growing merchant base, rising e-commerce activities, and partnerships with industry leaders provide a solid underpinning for stellar growth in the coming years. Its revenues are growing at an astounding rate over the past several years. Meanwhile, the rate of growth in its adjusted operating costs is lower than its top-line growth rate, which is an encouraging sign. The coronavirus is pushing a significant number of retailers and small- and medium-sized businesses to shift to online. The transition to online has created a long-term tailwind for Shopify, which should drive traffic, expand its market share, and support its high-margin products.

TheStreet's Katherine Ross spoke with Cramer Monday on Street Lightning about why investors shouldn't buy Biogen, Slack's dispute with Microsoft, and why someone is buying airline stocks. Biogen shares were surging after submitting an application for its key treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Biogen beat earnings estimates Wednesday and lifted its full-year guidance outlook. The question for investors is whether or not these results make shares of Biogen a buy? Cramer wouldn't buy Biogen after earnings and gives you another name he would be looking at in this space. Slack filed an EU complaint charging Microsoft with anti-competitive practice regarding the Teams software. TheStreet broke down what this EU complaint means for Slack and Microsoft. Slack also acquired business-directory provider Rimeto this month, calling it a natural fit with its messaging platform. Cramer talks about why he's not worried about this EU complaint. Airlines are starting to report earnings with American Airlines reporting a loss on Thursday but showed it's burning less cash than expected. TheStreet provided a guide for investors who are looking to trade airline stocks as earnings come in. United Airlines posted better than expected results on Tuesday but is down 9% this week.

(Nasdaq: GROW) (“the Company”), a boutique registered investment advisory firm specializing in gold and precious metals, natural resources and emerging markets, is pleased to announce that its airlines ETF, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), was approved to trade on Citi’s trading platform. The inclusion became effective Monday, July 20, making JETS available to even more investors.  This development comes a month after JETS, a smart-beta 2.0 ETF, crossed above $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) as investors sought exposure to airline stocks that had been knocked down following coronavirus-related travel restrictions. Between February 18 and June 10 of this year, JETS saw an incredible 70 straight trading days of positive inflows.  “We are thrilled that JETS has been approved by Citi,” says Frank Holmes, the Company’s CEO and chief investment officer. “It took five years of patience, capital and nurturing to build the JETS brand before its spectacular growth. That growth continues today with the ETF’s inclusion at Citi.”  Citi Personal Wealth Management, the financial advisory division of Citi, has more than 3,400 financial advisors in major metro areas around the U.S. As of August 2019, it had over $31 billion in AUM.

(NASDAQ: AAL) has offered cargo-only flights during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the new line of business didn't overcome the lost cargo moved on passenger airplanes that were grounded in the second quarter. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline on Thursday reported $130 million in cargo revenue for the quarter ended June 30, down 41% from the same quarter last year. Cargo revenue for the first half of the year amounted to $277 million, 37% below 2019. American said it currently operates more than 130 weekly widebody and cargo-only flights. It transported more than 100 million pounds of mail, goods and COVID-19 supplies worldwide in the second quarter. The airline suspended most information technology projects during the pandemic, but pressed ahead this spring with a three-year cargo systems modernization effort that reduced freight-related systems from about 100 to 10 and digitized paperwork. Earlier this month, American reorganized the cargo division's management. Cooling cash burn Overall, American posted a second quarter $2.7 billion pretax loss on a nearly $10 billion drop in revenue from last year. Total revenue for the second quarter reached $1.6 billion, down 86% compared to the prior year. CEO Doug Parker said on Thurday's earnings call that the airline's biggest priority is continuing to reduce cash burn across the system. The airline estimates that it will reduce 2020 operating and capital expenditures by more than $15 billion from a year ago, including $700 million in non-aircraft capital expenses by eliminating purchases of ground handling equipment and IT projects. Contributing to the savings is the retirement of more than 150 planes. American said 41,000 employees took advantage of its early retirement program, but reiterated that it still has more than 20,000 people on the payroll than it needs to operate in the fall.
