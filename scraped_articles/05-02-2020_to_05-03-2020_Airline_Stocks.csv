CNBC Newsletters,"(Follow live highlights of Berkshire’s meeting here.) Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and billionaire value investor Warren Buffett said that the conglomerate has sold the entirety of its equity position in the U.S. airline industry. The prior stake, worth north of $4 billion in December, included positions in United, American, Southwest and Delta Air Lines. “The world has changed for the airlines. And I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,” he said during Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting Saturday, which was virtual this year. “I don’t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.” But “I think there are certain industries, and unfortunately, I think that the airline industry, among others, that are really hurt by a forced shutdown by events that are far beyond our control,” he added. Demand for air travel has plunged since March as the virus and precautions like shelter-in-place orders keep potential passengers home. Asked by CNBC’s Becky Quick to clarify if Berkshire had sold all of its airline holdings, Buffett answered “yes.” He explained: “When we sell something, very often it’s going to be our entire stake: We don’t trim positions. That’s just not the way we approach it any more than if we buy 100% of a business. We’re going to sell it down to 90% or 80%.” “If we like a business, we’re going to buy as much of it as we can and keep it as long as we can,” he added. “And when we change our mind we don’t take half measures.” Buffett reiterated that he admires the airlines and their management teams, but that sometimes there are events like the coronavirus calamity “on the lower levels of probabilities that happen” that necessitate a quick change to an investment. As of December, Berkshire owned 42.5 million (10% stake) American shares, 58.9 million (9.2% stake) Delta shares, 51.3 million (10.1% stake) Southwest shares and 21.9 million (7.6% stake) United shares. The stocks are down 62.9%, 58.7%, 45.8% and 69.7%, respectively, in 2020. His comments Saturday afternoon from Omaha came after Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter earnings that showed Buffett and his lieutenants built up the conglomerate’s cash stockpile and only nibbled at equities during the violent stock market rout in March.

News is under threat …. Most popular","The legendary investor indicates that financial markets could still have further to fall as worldwide cases edge towards 3.5m Coronavirus latest updates  Warren Buffett, the legendary American investor, has sold his firm’s entire holdings in the four major US airlines, warning that the “world has changed” for the aviation industry because of the coronavirus crisis. In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible outcomes.  Shares around the world are poised for another torrid week as worldwide cases of the virus creep towards 3.5 million and deaths near 250,000. Despite massive central bank and government intervention, stock markets have been rocked by the continued spread of Covid-19, the plunge in oil prices and Donald Trump’s threats to reignite his trade war with China. Buffett, 89, who has become known as the Sage of Omaha for his investment skill over the decades, indicated that he believed stock markets had not reached the bottom of the current dip. Speaking at the virtual annual meeting of his company Berkshire Hathaway from Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett said he had not provided financial support to companies as he did buying Goldman Sachs shares during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing “attractive” enough, even after the recent plunge in the markets. The outlook appears particularly bleak for the airline industry, which has been hit by the shutdown of most of its traffic, forcing mass layoffs and even bankruptcies. FlyBe in the UK went into administration in the early days of the crisis and Virgin Atlantic has asked the government for a bailout. British Airways has announced mass redundancies, as has Ryanair. Virgin Australia has collapsed. Berkshire Hathaway had held sizeable positions in the major US airlines, including an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines, 10% of American Airlines, 10% of Southwest Airlines and 9% of United Airlines at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings. But with thousands of planes parked on tarmac across the world and no clear timetable for the resumption of air travel, Buffett said he had sold his stocks as the airline industry’s outlook rapidly changed. “We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss,” Buffett said. “We will","May 3, 2020",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/warren-buffett-dumps-us-airline-stocks-saying-world-has-changed-after-covid-19

Some stocks deserve their losses more than others.. Tolerable","   Last week, three of the top four U.S. airlines reported their first-quarter earnings results, giving investors a better look at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this uniquely vulnerable sector. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) all lost money and expect to incur even greater losses in the second quarter. That said, the scale of the companies' losses differed quite dramatically. Furthermore, the carriers have vastly different financial resources. Southwest Airlines measures up as best-of-breed along both dimensions, while American Airlines is in particularly bad shape. Bargain-hunting investors looking to snap up beaten-down airline stocks in the hope of a long-term recovery should stick to higher-quality companies like Southwest, while steering clear of weaker competitors like American -- and even United. While air travel demand fell off a cliff in March, Southwest Airlines benefited from strong performance in January and February. As a result, it posted a modest adjusted net loss of $77 million for the first quarter, on revenue of $4.2 billion: down 18% year over year. Of course, results will get a lot worse in the second quarter. Southwest expects revenue to plunge 90% to 95% year over year in April and May. However, the company has reduced average daily cash expenditures for the quarter to a range of $30 million to $35 million. That would limit quarterly cash burn to around $3 billion even with zero net cash inflows (i.e., if new cash bookings were fully offset by refunds). SOUTHWEST AIRLINES' REVENUE HAS FALLEN TO NEARLY ZERO THIS MONTH. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. Fortunately, Southwest has built up a fortress balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, it had $5.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and just $6.3 billion of debt. Between then and April 24, the carrier received half of its CARES Act payroll support funds (over $1.6 billion) and drew down an additional $2.7 billion on its 364-day term loan. As a result, the company had over $9 billion of cash on hand by the time of its earnings report last week. Southwest isn't stopping, either. Last week, it brought in nearly $4 billion by selling stock and convertible debt. (That amount could increase by 15%, depending on demand.) It will also receive the remaining $1.6 billion of CARES Act payroll funds by July.

The Oracle of Omaha has reversed course on the,"   Warren Buffett has bailed on the airlines, with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) selling its entire stakes in Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL). Airline stocks have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with travel demand all but evaporating. Most airline stocks have lost half of their value or more this year as a result, with the industry now focused more on survival than earnings growth.  AIRLINE DATA BY YCHARTS Speaking at Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett said he did not sell due to the declining share prices. Rather, ""I just decided that I'd made a mistake."" The announcement is sure to put further pressure on airline shares, as investors have made a lot of money over the years doing as Buffett does. But is the Oracle of Omaha right this time around? Berkshire has a long and turbulent history with the airlines. Three decades ago, he bought shares in USAir (now part of American) but ended up writing off much of that investment. In 2001, he swore off the industry, declaring that ""if capitalists had been present at Kitty Hawk when the Wright brothers' plane first took off, they should have shot it down."" IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL. But in recent years he warmed to the sector, becoming one of the largest shareholders in each of the four biggest U.S. airlines. The industry in the late 2000s went through a period of restructuring and consolidation that reduced the number of competitors chasing every passenger and allowing all the remaining participants to be more profitable. Buffett was so enamored with airlines that in 2019 he broke one of his cardinal rules and allowed Berkshire's position in Delta, and then Southwest, to climb above the 10% threshold. Crossing 10% led to Berkshire having to make more disclosures about its stakes in those carriers, which back in early April gave us our first hints Berkshire was selling. There is certainly reason for concern. Airlines have a rocky history during recessions, as the industry has seen a number of onetime high fliers -- including TWA, Pan Am, and Eastern -- disappear during past downturns. This COVID-19 slowdown has hit the industry worse than the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, with United, for example, expecting to fly fewer passengers in the entire month of May 2020 than it","May 2, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/02/warren-buffett-said-he-was-wrong-about-airlines-wa.aspx

During a virtual address to shareholders for the company’s annual shareholders meeting Saturday, the chairman and CEO called Berkshire’s recent purchase of roughly 10% of four of the world's largest airlines — including American (AAL), United (UAL), Delta (DAL) and Southwest (LUV) — an “understandable mistake.” But the company has sold out of its entire interest in the airlines, worth at least $4 billion. In doing so, the Oracle of Omaha admitted to a rare investment misstep, one that’s he pinned on the coronavirus crisis hammering the global economy. “The world changed for airlines,” the influential investor said at the meeting. [See also: Airline shares tank after Buffett reveals he dumped airline stocks] “It turned out that I was wrong about that business because of something that was not in any way the fault of four excellent CEOs,” Buffett said of COVID-19’s shock to air travel — adding that there was “no joy” in managing those companies right now. “But the companies we bought were well managed. They did a lot of things right. It’s a very, very, very difficult business because you’re dealing with millions of people every day and if something goes wrong for 1% of them, they are very unhappy,” Buffett added. Prior to stay at home orders put in place across the U.S. on March 1, the Transportation Safety Administration reported scanning nearly 2.3 million passengers — a number consistent with the prior year’s approximate 2 million passengers, per day. Yet fast forward to April 3, the agency scanned 129,763 passengers, and that number continues to decline. Buffett said he doubts whether the flying public, or even himself, will be willing to travel as frequently as they had by plane before the virus outbreak. “People have been told not to fly. I’ve been told not to fly for a while. I’m looking forward to flying. I may not fly commercial but that’s another question,” Buffett remarked.

Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting, Mr Buffett said ""the world has changed"" because of the coronavirus. He then said he had been wrong to invest in the airline industry. Mr Buffett's comments came just hours after Berkshire Hathaway announced a record $50bn (£40bn) net first quarter loss, Reuters news agency reports.

Mr Buffett told the meeting, which was held virtually: ""We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss. ""We will not fund a company that... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."" The US travel industry has almost collapsed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and taking thousands of planes out of service. Mr Buffett said he had been considering investing in additional airlines before the pandemic hit. ""It is a blow to have, essentially, your demand dry up,"" he said. ""It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country."" In a statement, Delta said it was aware of the sale and has ""tremendous respect for Mr Buffett and the Berkshire team"".

The airline business - and I may be wrong and I hope I'm wrong - but I think it's changed in a very major way. The future is much less clear to me. Then in 2016, Berkshire dove into the industry again, amassing stakes in the four largest US airlines. At the end of 2019, those stakes amounted to almost $US10 billion. Buffett's renewed faith in the industry prompted speculation that he might one day own one of the carriers. But now, he's cut those investments again. Berkshire disclosed in April that it had at least trimmed its Delta and Southwest stakes, both of which had previously been above a 10 per cent ownership level. ""The airline business - and I may be wrong and I hope I'm wrong - but I think it's changed in a very major way,"" Buffett said. ""The future is much less clear to me.""

Among those was billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who announced Saturday that it was a ""mistake"" to make such a gamble during the pandemic. Buffett's corporation, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., had $6.5 billion in equity sales during April, most of them from four major U.S. airlines—American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines Holding Inc. Approximately $6.1 billion of that was from the sale of airlines stock. During a live-streamed podcast Saturday for Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, Buffett said it ""was a mistake"" to invest so much into airlines during a time when travel has dwindled because so many people are under ""stay at home"" orders. ""When we bought [airlines], we were getting an attractive amount for our money,"" Buffett said. ""It turned out I was wrong about that business because of something that was not in any way the fault of four excellent CEOs. Believe me. No joy of being a CEO of an airline.

""The world changed for airlines and I wish them well,"" Buffett said while acknowledging his company lost money during the virus crisis. ""That was my mistake."" While saying he was ""wrong"" for the mistake, he delivered a forecast that has unknowing expectations of flight travel on these airlines in the foreseeable future. ""I don't know that three, four years from now people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year,"" Buffett said. ""You've got too many planes.""
