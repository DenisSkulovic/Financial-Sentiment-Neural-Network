1,3 Top Industrial Stocks to Watch in July | The Motley Fool,"3 Top Industrial Stocks to Watch in July. What could leaders in the transportation, construction, and airline industries tell us","   Although the stock market is near all-time highs, there's still a lot of questions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when it comes to industrial stocks that depend on a growing global economy. Over the summer, many companies will report earnings for the second quarter, a quarter that is expected to produce the worst results for the year. Here are three top industrial stocks whose results and predictions are worth paying attention to in July. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) investors finally got a win on Wednesday after the shipping giant beat expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter 2020 earnings. It reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.53 and revenue of $17.4 billion versus expectations of $1.52 EPS on revenue of $16.5 billion. The stock finished up over 11% on the day.  The earnings beat was a much-needed reprieve from quarter after quarter of earnings disappointments. In fact, for the eight quarters between the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, FedEx stock had fallen the day after. Every. Single. Time. Fiscal Quarter Expected EPS Actual EPS Percentage Stock Price Change The Following Day Q4 2020 $1.52 $2.53 11.71% Q3 2020 $1.43 $1.41 4.97% Q2 2020 $2.79 $2.51 (10.03%) Q1 2020 $3.17 $3.05 (12.92%) Q4 2019 $4.81 $5.01 (0.53%) Q3 2019 $3.10 $3.03 (3.50%) Q2 2019 $3.94 $4.03 (12.16%) Q1 2019 $3.81 $3.46 (5.53%) Q4 2018 $5.72 $5.91 (2.70%) Q3 2018 $3.08 $3.72 (1.18%) DATA SOURCES: FEDEX AND YAHOO FINANCE.  In late May, I mentioned that the integration of TNT Express and growth in FedEx Express thanks to seven-day shipping could make the stock a nice turnaround play, especially since FedEx was priced at a discount of more than 50% to where it was two years ago. What FedEx needed, and finally got, was a few good quarters to get its bearings and redefine its brand. Although FedEx's commercial volumes were down for the quarter, the company touted strong growth in residential deliveries. If FedEx can continue to deliver even decent results throughout the year, it will help give the company some stability moving forward. It's not out of the woods yet, but it's definitely a stock to watch in July and throughout the rest of the year.

And for the first time in a while, we've got some good news out of FedEx. Fourth quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected, stock up somewhere in the neighborhood of 12%, 15% so far today. And maybe this shouldn't be a surprise given the rise in boxes of stuff being delivered to everyone's home. Malin: Yeah, I mean, I think this is a fun one to follow today just given this is the first time we've seen positive news from FedEx in a really long time. I will, sort of, temper that news with the fact that it wasn't necessarily a knock it out of the park quarter for them, it was more that expectations were very, very low and they exceeded that. So, like you said, they did have peak level e-commerce volumes in the U.S., which I think is a pretty interesting metric to look at, but generally, they spoke a lot about how commercial volumes were down significantly due to business closures across the globe.

GET SUPER RICH: Follow Warren Buffett and Buy These Stocks Right Now.,"      Jitendra Parashar | July 6, 2020 | More on: ENB ENB TRP On July 5, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it is acquiring Dominion Energy’s gas transmission and storage assets in a deal worth $9.7 billion. These assets included Dominion’s natural gas transmission lines, gas transportation capacity, and gas storage capacity. After the deal, Buffett’s investment firm will also have partial ownership of Dominion’s liquefied natural gas export-import business and storage facility. Berkshire Hathaway expects the transaction to complete in Q4. Buffett always tries to invest in companies with moats around their business models and trustworthy management. Also, he always pays close attention to the overall future growth potential of their respective industries. Due to the fears about rising challenges in the airline industry because of the ongoing pandemic, Berkshire Hathaway sold all its airline stocks in the first quarter. While I might not completely agree with Buffett’s decision to sell all his airline stocks, I consider his move to invest in the energy sector a masterstroke. Let’s understand why. Earlier this year, the global energy demand suddenly slumped, as countries across the world imposed closures to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. Most of these countries are now on their way to reopen their all economic activities soon, causing a rapid surge in the energy demand. This expected rise is likely to benefit energy companies. It’s important to note that most energy companies tend to have extraordinarily high-profit margins as compared to companies belonging to several other capital-intensive industries. For example, TC Energy (TSX:TRP)(NYSE:TRP) — the Canadian energy firm — reported a solid 32.5% adjusted net profit margin in the first quarter. By comparison, its peer Enbridge’s  (TSX:ENB)(NYSE:ENB) had a 13.9% adjusted net profit margin during the same quarter. While Enbridge’s net profitability was much lower than TC Energy, it was still far better as compared to the profitability of most autos and steel producers. Interestingly, energy companies like TC Energy and Enbridge also offer handsome dividends to its investors. While TC Energy currently has a 5.5% dividend yield, Enbridge has a much higher 8% dividend yield. In my recent article about these two energy stocks, I’d highlighted how TC Energy doesn’t expect its 2020 financial and operating performance to get affected by the pandemic. Enbridge also doesn’t expect the pandemic to hurt its utility business this year. After the energy demand declined","Jul 6, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/07/06/get-super-rich-follow-warren-buffett-and-buy-these-stocks-right-now/
4,"Sorry Warren Buffett, Delta Air Lines (DAL) Stock Is Now a Buy | InvestorPlace","Sorry Warren Buffett, Delta Stock Is Now a Buy. A good defense is paramount, but investors should be upbeat on"," Many believe the world has changed due to the novel coronavirus. But within one of the market’s most impacted industries, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is poised to weather today’s seemingly impossible conditions. Let’s look at what’s happening off and on the DAL stock price chart and how one risk-adjusted solution can help investors profit from a sunnier, long-term forecast.  Much to our collective sorrow, the pandemic’s impact on the socioeconomic fabric of the United States is still very much alive and well. But it’s also true that since the pandemic’s outbreak, some well-positioned companies have come out on top. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) and Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) are among those companies benefiting. How? They all offer “essential” services in our new normal. Each of these stocks has also enriched investors as shares have hit all-time highs. They are also leading the broader averages to record-breaking gains. The same can’t be said for the airline industry and DAL stock. It’s no surprise of course. At the height of the pandemic’s first wave, airline traffic collapsed. But airlines remain essential services despite the obviously meaningful disruption. That’s not to say all airlines will get past the coronavirus. Some won’t. There are roughly 700 carriers globally. And if we’re to believe the International Air Transport Association, half of all airlines could go bankrupt due to the fallout from Covid-19. Still, and with no disrespect to Warren Buffett’s apocalyptic warning, DAL stock is in strong position to not only survive but thrive longer-term. The latest sign Delta will take off again is the company’s move last week to amend its revolving credit line. According to Reuters, the amended facility gives Delta access to a $1.33 billion three-year facility. Of that total amount, $1.25 billion has been extended to April 2022, giving the company an extra year. Plus, the deal gives DAL a $216 million standby letter of credit facility. This also matures in April 2022.  So, who are investors to believe when it comes to Delta? I believe it’s finally time to put some trust into Delta’s price chart. That wasn’t the case a month ago as shares soared higher on upbeat American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) news. In early June I warned of a likely pullback as an overbought situation in Delta tested key resistance on the weekly price chart. The advice proved correct. But an even deeper-than-anticipated","Jul 6, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/07/sorry-warren-buffett-delta-dal-stock-is-now-buy/
5,The Post-Pandemic Future May Be Surprisingly Favorable for JBLU Stock | InvestorPlace,3 Reasons Why JetBlue Is a Good Post-Pandemic Bet. Look past the virus headlines and JBLU stock makes for a," In the last month, investors have gotten to see JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) as an example of how the novel coronavirus is impacting our hopes and fears. JBLU stock moved up 50% in the span of a week. Unfortunately, it moved down nearly as fast. The recent buying of airline stocks is rooted in investors reaching for any strand of hope for an economic recovery. Some of that is irrational. Likewise, investors are selling airline stocks based on fear. And some of that fear is likewise irrational. The truth is somewhere in the middle. And the reality is that some airlines are in better shape than others. At the onset of the pandemic, I commented that on a historical basis, $15 seems to be a consistent high water mark for JBLU stock. And what do you know, the stock charged up to $15 in June. But while JetBlue got ahead of itself, I think there are three compelling reasons to buy JBLU stock on its current dip. It might take some time, but JetBlue looks ready to reward investors. In June, JetBlue announced a major initiative to launch 30 new routes. This would put it in direct competition with United Airlines (NYSE:UAL). And it would leave United with two options, one worse than the other. JetBlue chose many of those new routes to make an aggressive push into the Florida market. Those plans are probably on hold a little bit as Florida is dialing back its reopening plans. A big catalyst for JetBlue and other low-cost networks like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was the allure of Walt Disney World being open for business. That will have to wait. But while the economy may have some fits and starts, the industry has seen an undeniable increase in traffic. And having these new routes, in addition to having a strong balance sheet will position the company in a post-pandemic world. A good reason to consider JBLU stock over other airlines is that it does not have exposure to Boeing (NYSE:BA). Eighteen months ago, that would have seemed like a crazy statement. But Boeing will have to do all the right things to regain investors’ trust as well as the trust of airlines.

6,American Airlines share price forecast: flying higher or crash and burn?,American Airlines share price forecast: flying higher or crash and burn?. 2020 momentum didn’t last. Trade American Airlines Group Inc.,"Few if any investors would have imagined a scenario at the end of 2019 in which the airline sector would find itself in deep trouble. At the time, the competitive environment was fierce but the broader macroeconomic outlook was strong and consumers were confident enough in their personal situation to spend money on flights. The airliner, much like every other business in every industry in the world, had no knowledge of what was in store in the first half of 2020. American Airlines stock news was quite bullish at the very beginning of 2020. The company released encouraging fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results on January 23. American Airlines reported record revenue in 2019 at $45.8bn. The fourth quarter of 2019 marked the 13th consecutive quarter of unit revenue growth. The company prided itself on its goal of building an airline meant to “thrive for ever”. But within one week, the company delivered what proved to be the initial Covid-19 related blow to investor sentiment. United Airlines announced on January 29 that it would suspend travel from Los Angeles (LAX) to Shanghai Pudong Airport (PVG) and Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) till the end of March. The airline followed up in February with additional cancellations of flights to and from China and Hong Kong. By the end of the month, flights to and from Italy were also temporarily banned. As each day passed, the airline either expanded its no-go list and the American Airlines stock outlook deteriorated. Sell Buy Effective one minute before midnight on March 13, the US government imposed entry requirements that would force the entire airline industry to a near-halt. Within days, nearly every long-haul international flight was suspended. Prior concerns over the industry turned into fear at such alarming speed. American Airlines and its rivals were in desperate need of a government bailout. The IATA estimated on March 17 that “cash is pretty much running out” for airlines. Nearly immediately, the notion of a $50bn bailout package was floated around. The near-term American Airlines stock predictions called for new lows day after day. The stock wreckage finally came to an end when shares traded at a multi-year low of $8.25, nearly coinciding with confirmation of a bailout programme for the airline industry. As May came to an end, the American Airlines share price forecast improved as the company was on the receiving end of a $5.8bn","Jul 6, 2020",https://capital.com/american-airlines-share-price-forecast-and-analysis

The S&P 500 slid 1.1% to 3,145.32 while the Nasdaq Composite, which hit a record high earlier in the day, closed 0.9% lower at 10,343.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 396.85 points, or 1.5%, to 25,890.18. Shares of Amazon fell 1.9% to lead tech lower. Netflix closed 0.1% lower after hitting a record earlier in the day.

14,– Ignore Warren Buffett’s Bearishness. We Must Buy Stocks Now Because Mega Bull Run Is Coming: Sanjiv Bhasin,Ignore Warren Buffett’s Bearishness. We Must Buy Stocks Now Because Mega Bull Run Is Coming: Sanjiv Bhasin. Warren Buffett &,"  One of the most surprising aspects is that Warren Buffett neglected to follow his own timeless advice to us to “Buy stocks when there is blood on the Streets“. He implemented this advice in a masterful manner during the depths of the 2008 crash in the stock markets. “Buy Stocks, I am. If you wait for robins, spring will be gone,” he said, in a rousing battle cry to all the Bulls of the World. This led to the Mother of all Bull Runs which continued for a decade and even novice investors became Millionaires. Underperforming S&P 500 for 10 years However, after his rousing battle cry of 2008, Warren has been highly diffident, missing one golden opportunity after the other. This has caused his Berkshire Hathaway Fund to under-perform the S&P 500 over a long period of 10 years, frustrating devoted followers and shareholders.   In fact, the sorry state of affairs led Prof Ashwath Damodaran, also a Pundit, to issue the Fatwa that Warren “should no longer be put on a pedestal and worshipped like a Deity“. CoronaVirus gains also missed out Even in the present crisis, Warren’s attitude has been highly diffident and counter-intuitive. He dumped his entire portfolio of airline stocks at their lowest point and suffered a crippling loss. He also sold several other stocks and raised his cash holdings to a massive $136 Billion. This means that he totally missed out on the spectacular gains of nearly 40% given by the Dow Jones since the low point of March 2020. Victim of potshots Naturally, this sorry state of affairs has made Warren Buffett the target of potshots from all and sundry. Dave Portnoy, who is regarded as the leader of the Punters on Wall Street, ridiculed the Sage of Omaha as having “lost his fastball” and and called him “washed out“.    Even President Donald Trump called out the legendary investor for having made a “mistake“.  The contagion has also spread to Dalal Street. Sanjiv Bhasin politely described him as “no longer an icon“. “Warren Buffett is no longer the icon that he was. In fact, he was most bearish and still is and he has missed the greatest rally in history. So I will make no bones about it,” the veteran said.

Etihad Airways Joint Venture[edit].," Alitalia - Società Aerea Italiana S.p.A,[6][7] operating as Alitalia (Italian pronunciation: [aliˈtaːlja]), is the flag carrier and largest airline of Italy.[8] The company has its head office in Fiumicino, Metropolitan City of Rome Capital.[9] Its main hub is Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport, Rome, with a secondary hub at Linate Airport, Milan. Other focus airports are Catania–Fontanarossa Airport, Milan Malpensa Airport, Palermo Airport and Naples Airport.[3] The airline is fully owned by the Government of Italy since 17 March 2020. The airline operates a fleet of Airbus A319, Airbus A320, Airbus A321, Airbus A330-200, and Boeing 777-200ER aircraft to over 100 scheduled domestic, European and intercontinental destinations. The airline is a full member of SkyTeam alliance. In 2018, it was the twelfth-largest airline in Europe. Alitalia - Linee Aeree Italiane S.p.A. was established on 16 September 1946 as Aerolinee Italiane Internazionali (Italian International Airlines). It was formed as a result of an Anglo-Italian agreement and was funded by the Italian government and British European Airways (BEA) in a 60/40 share arrangement with a capital of 900 million lire (£1,000,000).[10] Its popular name, Alitalia, blended the Italian words ali (wings) and Italia (Italy). It started operations on 5 May 1947, in which year it carried over 10,000 passengers. The inaugural flight was with a Fiat G.12 Alcione, piloted by Virginio Reinero from Turin to Catania and Rome. The first intercontinental flight left a year later, flying between Milan and cities in South America. The Savoia-Marchetti SM.95 four engined airliner was used on European routes up to 1949. On 31 October 1957, Alitalia merged with Linee Aeree Italiane and took on the name of Alitalia – Linee Aeree Italiane. Alitalia was owned by the Italian Ministry of the Treasury (49%), other shareholders, including employees (49%) and Air France-KLM (2%, now: 25%). By 1960 Alitalia was operating jet airliners on some European routes (the Sud Caravelle) and the Douglas DC-8 on several longer distance routes. The Vickers Viscount propeller-turbine four-engined airliner was flown by Alitalia on its European network throughout the 1960s. In 1978 Alitalia had its head office in the Palazzo Alitalia in Rome.[11] By the 1990s Alitalia was carrying 25 million passengers annually. In 1997 it set up a regional subsidiary Alitalia Express and in 2001 became a member of SkyTeam. In November 2003 Alitalia announced that it would cut 2,700 jobs over the next three years to prepare the airline","Jul 5, 2020",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia

The struggle to maintain confidence in Hong Kong's future is manifesting in its stock and currency markets. , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s rallying stock market is defying predictions of the death of the city in the wake of a new security law. The Hang Seng Index has jumped 7.8% since the law was imposed on July 1, its best three-day gain since April 2015, and entered a bull market on Monday. The advance has been led by mainland Chinese firms listed locally, with Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. and China Life Insurance Co. jumping more than 29%, but Hong Kong firms have also seen sharp gains. A sudden rally in mainland equities and a strengthening yuan have stimulated investor appetite for Hong Kong shares, which were recently the cheapest relative to the U.S. since at least 2005. But regardless of the cause, a rising stock market will bolster claims by officials that the new law would bring both stability and prosperity to a city that has been wracked by protests. Such views seemed far-fetched in May, when news of the national security legislation first broke. The index fell almost 7% that month, clocking up the biggest drop relative to the MSCI All-Country World Index in more than two decades. Yet it was apparent then that Beijing was keen to shore up the city as a financial center in the face of growing overseas concern. Waves of mainland capital flooded into equities as international investors dumped them, helping to strengthen the local currency. A flood of listings by Chinese firms are adding support. JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc. last month raised $7 billion through secondary share sales in Hong Kong. While a rising stock market will do little to assuage concerns about the sweeping nature of the legislation, and the manner in which it was implemented, an extended rally may bring some cheer to a city with a broken economy and dim outlook.","Jul 6, 2020",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/hong-kong-stocks-surge-into-a-bull-market-in-win-for-government-1.1460970
