3,10 Most Profitable Airlines In The World: 2019 Rankings - Insider Monkey,"10 Most Profitable Airlines In The World: 2019 Rankings. Published on November 30, 2019 at 7:01 pm by NEHA GUPTA","What are the 10 most profitable airlines in the world? Stiff competition is the order of the day in the aviation industry as airlines battle it out for travelers dollars in the race for profits. In the highly competitive field, United States based airlines continue to dominate the list of the most profitable airlines in the world. The dominance stems from the fact that they are the biggest airlines in the world in 2019 backed by one of the most developed travel industry. In an industry where there are more than 200 airlines, we had to base our listing of the most profitable airlines, on companies that make their earnings public. In narrowing the list, we also centered on household names with a global touch when it comes to air services. In our list of the most profitable airlines in the world, we have based our listing on the total amount of profits generated in 2018. Also, we have reported the revenues generated as well as the total flights operated, which affirms their dominance in the industry.  The list of the most profitable airlines in the world also takes into consideration the number of aircraft as well as flights that an airline operates. With the listing, it became increasingly clear that the most profitable airlines in the world are the ones with flights to more destination around the world. To ensure that our ranking was based on the latest data, we crosschecked with releases from reputable media outlets such as Business Insider and Consultancy.uk. US airlines file quarterly financial reports with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). That’s why we can see the long-term trends in US airlines’ profitability through time. The entire US airline industry generated a total after-tax profit of $25 billion in 2015. Unfortunately that figure withered down to $11.8 billion through 2018. That’s why airline investors have been frustrated in recent years. For example American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) shares lost 50% of their value over the last 2 years. Price competition is good for passengers, but not for investors. The chart below shows the total US airline industry profits by year.  During the fourth quarter of 2018, US airlines received total passenger revenues of nearly $26 billion. They also generated $919 million from baggage charges, $460 million from reservation changes, and $263 million from cargo. Total quarterly revenue for the domestic US airline","Nov 30, 2019",https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-most-profitable-airlines-in-the-world-2019-rankings-791551/
4,3 Tips for Defensive Investors From Warren Buffett’s Teacher - The Motley Fool Canada,". . . . . . . . 3 Tips for Defensive Investors From Warren Buffett’s Teacher. Adequate diversification. Large,","      Kay Ng | December 1, 2019 | More on: PSI Investors don’t lose money because their stocks go down. They lose money because they sell their declined stocks. Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, was Warren Buffett’s teacher and a key influencer to Buffett’s winning investing style. Graham offers three defensive investing tips in The Intelligent Investor. These tips will powerfully boost your overall investment success. Graham suggests holding 10-30 stocks for adequate diversification. Jason Zweig added commentary in the book, stating, “Diversification doesn’t just minimize your odds of being wrong.” It also maximizes your chances of being right… Money Magazine identified the 30 best-performing stocks over the 30 years ending in 2002… the list is startlingly unpredictable. Rather than lots of technology or health-care stocks, it included Southwest Airlines, Worthington Steel, Dollar General discount stores, and snuff-tobacco maker UST Inc.” This reminded me of when Air Canada traded at $6 per share back in 2014 — a dirt-cheap price-to-earnings ratio of less than five. Of course, at the time, it seemed like the company was in hot water. In hindsight, however, it could make sense to allocate a small portion of a diversified portfolio in the industry leader as a contrarian investment. The stock went on to be an eight-bagger, delivering annualized returns of close to 45% per year! Defensive investors should choose industry leaders, which have large scale and competitive advantages. Pason Systems (TSX:PSI) is an industry leader, though arguably, the industry of oil and gas services equipment has diminished in prominence. Still, as a market leader, Pason Systems enjoys, well, a market-leading margin. Year to date, its adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.3%. Its profitability has remained remarkably stable despite the lower drilling activity in North America. Although it increased capital spending by 21%, its free cash flow only fell 4% to $66 million. Notably, Pason Systems’ balance sheet is very solid with no long-term debt to weigh it down, which means it doesn’t have to worry about servicing debt. Defensive investors should consider stocks that have at least 10 years of dividend payments with no dividend cuts. Pason Systems stock has this characteristic, but it has been abandoned by the market lately. It could therefore be a strong contrarian pick. Pason Systems has maintained or increased its dividend since 2003. That’s 16 years of continuous dividend payments.

5,2 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in December | The Motley Fool,"2 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in December. Whether you want to visit cyberspace or outer space, these companies can","   It can be very profitable to find and invest in companies that are upsetting the status quo. One of the co-founders of the Motley Fool, David Gardner, has a name for these types of companies: Rule Breakers. Today, we're going to use his No. 1 criterion and take a look at a first mover in an important emerging industry. This company is Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), a name that is leading the way in space tourism. We're also going to look at a ""non-first mover"" company that is not a classic Rule Breaker. This company is Sea Limited (NYSE:SE). Sea is the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Southeast Asia. And it's the Activision Blizzard of Southeast Asia. And it's the PayPal of Southeast Asia. Yes, Sea is similar to three amazing American businesses. And it's uniting all three internet businesses under one roof, creating synergies that make the whole company stronger. So let's strap in and go for a ride to our space hotel! Or maybe just to Singapore. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Several billionaires are investing in space flight, including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Sir Richard Branson. Musk, the founder of Tesla and the co-founder of PayPal, owns an amazing nonpublic company called SpaceX. The reason Musk is not selling shares of SpaceX to the public is because he wants to go to Mars. And it's not profitable to go to Mars. Shareholders would object and maybe sue him, because right now, going to Mars is a money-losing operation. So SpaceX remains private. Virgin Galactic, on the other hand, is now public. Is this a money-losing operation? Right now it is, very much so. The stock dropped almost 10% by market close on Nov. 22. It's dropping another 9% on Nov. 25, as I write these words. When a stock drops that far and that fast, don't be in a hurry to jump in. It could get even cheaper. Entrepreneurs can and do fail all the time. However, Branson is a billionaire entrepreneur, somebody who has started up 60 businesses under his Virgin umbrella. That's an impressive feat, and it tells you a couple of things about the man. One, he is very successful at starting up businesses, and two, he is not running all of his companies. While Elon Musk is the CEO of SpaceX, Sir Richard Branson is not the CEO of Virgin Galactic.

Sabina Chopra, co-founder and COO, corporate travel","Airfares on key domestic routes during Christmas and New Year have so far not seen the usual holiday season spike, largely due to quick capacity addition by airlines.As per data provided by travel portal Yatra.com, airfares on major sectors are higher by up to 8% year-on-year during Christmas and New Year this time as compared to 15-20% y-o-y jump witnessed for bookings same time last year.
For instance, a return fare on Delhi-Mumbai route is dearer by 8% from last year to Rs 6,840 for the journey undertaken between December 24 and December 31. Similarly, a two-way travel between Mumbai and Bengaluru could cost Rs 5,910 for travel, up 7.5% y-o-y for the trip during last week
of December. An airline executive pointed out that Jet had started cancelling flights due to cash crunch around this time in 2018, leading to fare hikes by competitors. “Yields were up by 2-3% for the airlines in July-September period last year due to stronger fares. Trouble at Jet had started by then, which gave airlines opportunity to command higher fares. The financial results, however, were impacted by high fuel costs and currency depreciation,” the executive said. Travel site EaseMyTrip said it is experiencing flat fares on popular routes for the Christmas and New Year period. “We are not witnessing much difference in airfares for the year-end in comparison to last year. Goa, one of the most popular destinations for travellers during winter, is seeing similar fares while flights to Udaipur and Andamans have reduced 10-20% y-o-y,” said Prashant Pitti, executive director, EaseMyTrip.  Analysts noted that airfares in November 2019 were down 11% y-o-y due to quick capacity addition by airlines. “Increasing capacity has kept fares under stress even during the festive season when travel sees an uptick.

The airport will come up in 5,000","Swiss company Zurich Airport International has outbid Adani group and GMR group-led consortium DIAL to emerge as the highest bidder for the proposed Greenfield international airport at Jewar. GMR, which runs the Delhi International Airport (DIAL), had the first right of refusal (RoFR) if the difference between its bid and the highest bidder was within 10%. This not being the case, the RoFR clause became redundant. The Noida International Airport (NIAL) on Friday selected Zurich International as the concessionaire for developing the Jewar airport, in Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. The airport, the second in the NCR, is set to be the biggest airport in India upon completion. Four bidders — Delhi International Airport (DIAL), Zurich International, Anchorage Infrastructure Investment Holdings and Adani Enterprise — were in the fray. In the financial bids for the project, which were opened on Friday, Zurich International offered the highest revenue share per passenger of `400.97 against Adani’s bid of `360 per passenger. DIAL offered `351 per passenger while Anchorage’s offer was Rs 205 per passenger. Talking to FE, Shailendra Bhatia, nodal officer of Noida Airport project, said Zurich International has been selected as a successful company as it offered the best price. “The project would now be put up before the project monitoring and implementation committee, which will meet on December 2, after which it will be sent to the UP Cabinet for its approval”. The airport will come up in 5,000 hectare area when fully constructed and is estimated to cost Rs 29,560 crore. The airport will have six to eight runways, the most in India, when fully built, according to officials. According to sources in NIAL, the first phase of the project would be spread over 1,334 hectare and cost Rs 4,588 crore as it is expected to be completed by 2023. It would handle nearly 12 million passengers per year and will go a long way in not only easing Delhi airport’s air traffic congestion and also boost the stagnant real estate prices. The second phase of the Jewar Airport project is due to be completed by FY31 and will increase the airport’s capacity to 30 million passengers per year, while the third and fourth phase are due to be finished by FY36 and FY40, respectively, and further boost the capacity to 50 million passengers and 70 million passengers, respectively.

Qantas. RELATED. Virgin's Scurrah brings urgency to","L1 Capital has predicted the Virgin Australia-owned budget carrier Tiger Airways will continue to cut capacity and could eventually be forced to shut the airline completely, as Virgin's new chief Paul Scurrah hunts for ways to lift profits. But Virgin says it has no plans to shut the airline, and says capacity reductions announced across the group last month, which included cuts at Tiger large enough to have two planes taken out of its fleet, will strengthen Virgin's financial position. Mark Landau, managing director of L1 Capital, which is an investor in Virgin's rival Qantas, made the bold prediction on the future of Tiger at the Future Generation investor forum in Melbourne last week. Capacity cuts are already under way at Tiger under Paul Scurrah. Paul Rovere He argued a restructuring at Tiger would be the catalyst for a surge in profitability at both Qantas and Virgin Australia, which acquired the 40 per cent of Tiger it didn’t already own in 2015. “Tiger is losing money on many routes and it will be forced to significantly cut capacity or shut down altogether,"" Mr Landau told the forum. ""That will be the step change that will see both airlines significantly increase their profitability.” Mr Scurrah has promised a renewed focus on earnings and cash flow at Virgin, and taken action to cut costs at Tiger in recent months, announcing a series of structural changes and pushing ahead with a plan to use only Boeing 737s in its fleet to manage costs. On November 6, Virgin announced a plan to slash capacity across the group by 2 per cent by the end of the 2020 financial year. As part of these cuts, Tiger will no longer fly the Brisbane-Darwin route or Proserpine-Sydney from February next year. Flights from Adelaide to Brisbane will cease at the end of March next year. Virgin’s balance sheet has now become very highly geared, which will force them to be far more focused on route profitability. — Mark Landau, managing director, L1 Capital But Virgin says the subsidiary remains an important part of its future. ""Operating our low-cost carrier strengthens our offering and enables us to cater to a growing low-cost market segment in Australia,"" a spokesman said.

If the project is completed on time, Jewar airport — projected as the second such facility for the National Capital Region — will compete with GMR-owned Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) from 2023 to attract air traffic. This could be a threat to IGIA’s monopoly on air traffic in north India, which has made it the crown jewel in GMR Infrastructure’s airport portfolio. Zurich Airport offered a revenue share of Rs 400.97 per passenger. GMR, which had the right of first refusal (RoFR), offered Rs 351 per passenger. It would have had the chance to match the highest bid only if its offer was within 10 per cent of it. “GMR’s bid was aggressive and rightly so, as they were desperate to win it because of a lot of synergy it offers with IGIA. That Zurich was able to outbid GMR, which had a RoFR, is something extraordinary. It doesn’t happen every day,” said an executive of a financial institution which invests in infrastructure projects. Jewar is about 80 km from IGIA. A six-year-long moratorium over concession fees to be paid to the government may give a buffer to Zurich. But, in the long term, completion of the project on time will determine its ability to compete with Delhi, said experts. “The winning bid marks the re-entry of Zurich Airport in India. What is defining is the entry of an experienced player in a market that has GMR, GVK, Fairfax, and Adani. Their bidding number underscores their understanding of the Indian market and how important they think it is,” said Sidharath Kapur, former executive director at GMR Airports.

The last time Nissan faced an existential crisis was two decades ago, when it was on the verg 7e of bankruptcy and was rescued by Renault SA, which took a stake in the Japanese carmaker and sent in Carlos Ghosn to turn it around. Ghosn later added Mitsubishi Motors Corp. to the pact, which became the world’s biggest carmaking alliance under the former chairman and CEO. Once again, Nissan needs to get its business in order. And fast. Ghosn’s arrest a year ago on charges of financial crimes unleashed corporate infighting, and damaged Nissan’s relations with Renault. Profits are at decade lows, 12,500 jobs will be cut and there are few new models to refresh an aging product lineup. Autonomous vehicles and electrification are poised to disrupt the industry in a once-in-a-generation shift. “It’s not realistic to expect a miraculous V-shaped recovery, but it is important to show that it can be done,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida said. “Externally, Uchida needs to normalize the relationship with Renault and restore trust in Nissan. Internally, he needs to address the gulf that’s opened up between employees and management.” Uchida, who most recently ran Nissan’s joint venture in China, is scheduled to hold his first news conference as CEO later on Monday at Nissan’s Yokohama headquarters. The 53-year-old formally took over Dec. 1. Nissan overhauled top management a month ago, adopting a collective-style leadership aimed at moving past the outsized influence Ghosn had over Nissan and the alliance with top shareholder Renault. Ashwani Gupta was appointed chief operating officer, and Jun Seki as deputy COO. The son of an airline employee, Uchida lived abroad in several countries including Egypt while growing up. He studied theology at Japan’s Doshisha University, an unusual background for a car executive. Unlike Ghosn, he’s seen as a quiet, straightforward manager used to delegating power, people with knowledge of the matter have said.

Bloomberg/Jason Alden , Bloomberg Everyone knows you can enjoy wonderful meals in cities such as Paris, New York, London and Tokyo. But what of other dining destinations, with fabulous dishes that are more likely to be found in casual bars or bistros than in fancy restaurants? We asked some of the world’s leading chefs about their favourite food cities, from the markets of Ghana in West Africa through the crowded and noisy streets of Kolkata to a tiny island off Auckland, in New Zealand. Here are their recommendations. Buenos Aires, Argentina Mauro Colagreco is the holder of the title of World’s Best Restaurant at Mirazur, in the south of France. But he still misses the food of his native Argentina.  “The country and cuisine are both incredibly close to my heart,” he says. “I often return to La Plata and Buenos Aires to see family and spend time there. In Buenos Aires, I always recommend Parrilla Don Julio, it offers the best Argentinian meat cooked with unparalleled expertise.

16,Stocks tumble on jitters over US stand on Hong Kong issue | Philstar.com,SIGN UP TO RECEIVE OUR EMAIL,"MANILA, Philippines — A new development that could further fuel tensions between the US and China sent the stock market crashing yesterday. The Philippine Stock Exchange index tumbled for a second consecutive session to close the week on a sour note, dropping 0.38 percent or 29.70 points to close at 7,738.96. The broader All Shares index was likewise in the red, dropping 0.38 percent or 18.11 points to finish at 4,632.84. “Philippines shares along with US stock futures tumbled on Thanksgiving after US President Donald Trump signed into law a controversial bill backing Hong Kong protestors,” Regina Capital’s Luis Limlingan said. Limlingan said the move can potentially add strain to the US’ current trade relationship with China. The Hong Kong issue likewise left other regional markets reeling as they also closed in the negative territory. In the local market, only two gauges managed to end on a positive note. These were the property and services, which rose 0.43 percent and 0.08 percent, respectively. The rest were in the red, led by the mining and oil counter as well as financials which plunged 1.89 percent and 1.59 percent, respectively. Value turnover stood at P6.37 billion. Market breadth was negative as decliners pummeled advancers, 125 to 63, while 48 stocks did not change.  The most important news of the day

17,I opened a high-yield savings account to pay for my wedding - Business Insider,". I opened a high-yield savings account to pay for my wedding the week I got engaged, and liked it","  When my now-husband asked me where I wanted to go on our first date I remember saying, ""I don't care, as long as it's cheap. I'm on a budget."" Six years later he asked me to marry him, and I opened up our first shared bank account that week so we could start saving for our wedding. Money has been a constant source of conversation throughout our relationship — not because we're overly fixated on it, but because we've always been open and honest about the way money touches our lives, both separately and together. When we started dating, money affected how much money we felt comfortable spending on going out. When we moved in together, it affected where we could afford to apartment hunt and how we were going to share our newly joint living costs. When we faced challenges, like my medical bills not covered by insurance and his apartment getting broken into, money became a safety net. It's not that money affected us any more or less than anyone else, it was just something we talked about a lot more than anyone else. And when we got engaged was no different. I immediately started thinking through logistics — mapping out all of the major goals we had for the next five years and the estimated amount of money needed to afford them. We started putting a plan of action in place by opening our first shared bank account — a high-yield online savings account. Well, for starters, our biggest and most near-term financial goal post-engagement was to pay for our wedding — so a savings account dedicated to funding the milestone seemed like a natural place to start joining our finances. To maximize our money with higher interest rates without locking it up in a CD or risking it in investment accounts, we opted for high-yield online savings. We agreed we would each contribute a lump sum that we'd already had in our individual savings to get the account funded. When choosing our first shared savings account, we had a few criteria: High interest rates According to the FDIC, the national average interest rate on savings is just 0.09% APY. Many traditional brick-and-mortar banks offer even less on their savings accounts. So we decided to explore online-only savings accounts which typically offer higher rates.
