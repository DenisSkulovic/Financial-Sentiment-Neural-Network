0,Can We See Significant Insider Ownership On The El Al Israel Airlines Ltd (TLV:ELAL) Share Register? - Simply Wall St News,Can We See Significant Insider Ownership On The El Al Israel Airlines Ltd (TLV:ELAL) Share Register?. What Does The Institutional,"If you want to know who really controls El Al Israel Airlines Ltd (TLV:ELAL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Warren Buffett said that he likes 'a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people'. So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented. With a market capitalization of ‚Ç™494m, El Al Israel Airlines is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutional investors have bought into the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about El Al Israel Airlines. View 3 warning signs we detected for El Al Israel Airlines Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors own 19% of El Al Israel Airlines. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at El Al Israel Airlines's earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters. It looks like hedge funds own 7.0% of El Al Israel Airlines shares. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Knafaim Holdings Ltd is currently the company's largest shareholder with 37% of shares outstanding, The Phoenix Pension and Provident Fund Ltd. is the second largest shareholder with 11% of common stock, followed by Delek Group Ltd., holding 8.8% of the stock. Our analysis suggests that the top 3 shareholders collectively control 57% of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, It is","Dec 25, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/transportation/tase-elal/el-al-israel-airlines-shares/news/can-we-see-significant-insider-ownership-on-the-el-al-israel-airlines-ltd-tlvelal-share-register

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks. Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market.

3,3 Buffett Stocks to Put on the Naughty List | The Motley Fool,"3 Buffett Stocks to Put on the Naughty List. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is known for picking winners, but","   Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett has a knack for picking winners, which is why he's arguably the most-followed Wall Street investor. Having beat the market more often than not, Buffett has seen his net worth grow by $89 billion over the past 65 years, all while creating in excess of $400 billion in value for Berkshire's shareholders. But one thing Buffett is not is perfect -- which is perfectly OK, because no investors are perfect. For example, Buffett's decision to buy stodgy tech stock IBM proved less than fruitful for investors, while his investment in U.K.-based grocer Tesco ultimately backfired. Buffett also misfired by selling off stock in Walt Disney far earlier than he should have, which has cost the Oracle of Omaha at least $16 billion in would-be capital gains. At the moment, a vast majority of the 48 securities held in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio have the hallmark of being winning stocks. Yet, there are three that should be placed on the naughty list as we head into 2020. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY CEO WARREN BUFFETT AT HIS COMPANY'S ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING. IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL. Without question, the disaster du jour of 2019 for Buffett was his company's investment in Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC). In February, Kraft Heinz took a monstrous writedown on the value of certain brands totaling $15.4 billion. The scary part is that this did little to actually make its balance sheet look more appealing. As of the end of the third quarter, the company still had $35.8 billion in goodwill and $29 billion in net debt. Essentially, it signals that more writedowns may be coming. The company's $29 billion in debt is particularly worrisome given that Kraft Heinz's growth engine has completely stalled out. The company needs money now more than ever to reinvest back into its brands and reignite growth. However, because Kraft Heinz is buried under long-term debt, it has little choice but to tighten its belt and sell off a number of noncore brands. This is a recipe for subpar sales and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth in the years to come. As for Buffett, he's fully admitted that Heinz grossly overpaid for Kraft Foods, but Berkshire is virtually trapped in its position. With 325.6 million shares owned (26.7% of Kraft Heinz's outstanding shares), Buffett has no viable means of exiting the position without causing","Dec 24, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/24/3-buffett-stocks-to-put-on-the-naughty-list.aspx

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Hedge funds and other investment firms that we track manage billions of dollars of their wealthy clients' money, and needless to say, they are painstakingly thorough when analyzing where to invest this money, as their own wealth also depends on it. Regardless of the various methods used by elite investors like David Tepper and David Abrams, the resources they expend are second-to-none. This is especially valuable when it comes to small-cap stocks, which is where they generate their strongest outperformance, as their resources give them a huge edge when it comes to studying these stocks compared to the average investor, which is why we intently follow their activity in the small-cap space. Nevertheless, it is also possible to identify cheap large cap stocks by following the footsteps of best performing hedge funds. What do these smart investors think about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)? Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shareholders have witnessed an increase in hedge fund interest in recent months. PFE was in 55 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of September. There were 52 hedge funds in our database with PFE positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that PFE isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q3 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q2 rankings). Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that hedge funds' large-cap stock picks indeed failed to beat the market between 1999 and 2016. However, we were able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the Russell 2000 ETFs by 40 percentage points since May 2014 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 27.8% through November 21, 2019.

Today, my goal is to discuss the difference between staking and lending and how you can use these techniques to adapt your trading strategy depending on your risk/reward profile. Essentially, while staking helps to secure the network and in turn pays users with newly minted coins, lending allows users to lock up their coins and receive an interest payment. I cannot say one strategy is better than the other, as it depends on what type of investor you are. If you like to directly participate in a protocol, perhaps staking is more your thing, while if you‚Äôre simply looking to get an interest payment, lending could be the right choice for you. Similarly, if you consider giving up control of your coins too risky no matter what, then you may think neither strategy is worthwhile. It‚Äôs completely up to you, and you should always do your own research and make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with your level of risk/reward when trading.

Loyalty and rewards management company on Thursday announced,"Loyalty and rewards management company on Thursday announced its new brand name called, ‚ÄòInterMiles‚Äô as it dropped the name Jet Privilege. The move comes seven months after Jet Airways was grounded due to an acute cash crunch. Aviation firm, Etihad has a 50.1% stake in Jet Privilege Private Limited (JPPL). JPPL has close to 10 million members. ‚ÄúThe company in the last five years has expanded from running an airline-centric program to emerging as an everyday travel-and-lifestyle rewards program as discerning consumers have shifted beyond transactional rewards and cashback. In fact, over the last six months alone, the program has managed over 33 billion InterMiles,‚Äù said Zameer Kochar, vice president- Marketing and Member Engagement. The company has tied-up with Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, among others. For fuel, InterMiles has tied-up with Indian Oil Corporation among others. Experts believe that re-branding and restructuring of loyalty programs usually helps the company to acquire more customers. ‚ÄúWe have seen re-branding usually helps to attract customers,‚Äù said Anil Talreja, partner, Deloitte India. Through the program, members can earn InterMiles across airlines to hotel bookings around the world, to shopping, dining and more. Members can redeem InterMiles for free flights, free hotel stays, free fuel and across more than 2,500 merchandise. ‚ÄúWe are embarking on a new journey with InterMiles. What started as a frequent flyer program has, today, become the platform of choice that empowers our members to fulfill their travel and lifestyle aspirations. The name InterMiles suggests the interchangeable nature of the rewards currency where it can be earned and redeemed across platforms including airlines, hotels, dine, shop, fuel among others,‚Äù Manish Dureja, managing director, Jet Privilege, said. JPPL was formed as a fully-owned subsidiary of Jet Airways in 2012 and was hived off as a separate entity in 2014 when Etihad bought a 50.1% stake for $150 million. After that strategic alliance between Jet and Etihad, JPPL became a part of the Etihad Aviation Group in which Etihad has a 50.1% stake, while Jet Airways has the remaining 49.9%.

As bitcoin price heads down, Bloomberg‚Äôs Joe Weisenthal is out to destroy the cryptocurrency‚Äôs most important bullish indicator. By: Yashu Gola | Email | Leave a comment A price forecasting model that predicts bitcoin at a $100,00 valuation by Christmas 2021 is complete nonsense, according to Joe Weisenthal. The Bloomberg Markets editor questioned the much-celebrated Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model for measuring an asset‚Äôs future pricing on the basis of its supply rate. He explained that people would naturally bid up bitcoin‚Äôs price should they decided to buy the cryptocurrency, adding that ‚Äúthere is no need for more coins at all.‚Äù Mr. Weisenthal tweeted: Let‚Äôs suppose society wanted to hold a lot more BTC. Maybe $268 billion [‚Ä¶] All people need to do is bid up the price of Bitcoin until it doubles. Then voila. Society‚Äôs desire to hold $268 billion of BTC would be satisfied. The math is simple. [The] society holds what it wants. Bitcoin is not a base asset to measure global portfolios; the US dollar is. So it is more likely for investors to denominate their cryptocurrency holdings in dollars. Mr. Weisenthal said the price of bitcoin would rise only because people want to weight more of the global portfolio to it. For instance, the market prices gold based on its relationship with the dollar. An investor who wants to migrate a portion of its gold portfolio to bitcoin does it within the context of its overall investment portfolio; the number of bitcoin he buys does not matter to him.

Aircraft orders. Cabin crew recruitment. SHARE."," MORE File photo   -  REUTERS  Despite severe headwinds in the aviation sector, the recruitment of pilots and staff crew by airlines has gone up substantially in the past two years. According to data released by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MOCA), the hiring of pilots has gone up by 88.4 per cent while cabin crew recruitment saw rise of 82.8 per cent. The past financial year has been very eventful starting with the fluctuation of the rupee, high ATF costs, grounding of Boeing 737 Max, the possible demise of Jet Airways and the potential disinvestment of state-run Air India and the overall economic slowdown. At the same time, several airlines have placed huge aircraft orders, expanded their operation network and hired expeditiously to meet the demands of a growing passenger base. According to the MOCA data reviewed by BusinessLine, as of December, 2,301 pilots were recruited via recruitment exams held by scheduled airlines. In comparison, 1,221 and 1,696 pilots recruited in 2017 and 2018 respectively. With 1,088 pilots hired in 2019, IndiGo remained at the top of the ladder of recruitment which was 148 per cent higher than in 2017. SpiceJet hired 398 pilots compared to 143 pilots in 2017. Air Asia hired 246 pilots which is 173 per cent higher than in 2017. Vistara too hired 224 pilots which is 194 per cent higher than that of 2017. State-run Air India‚Äôs pilot recruits dropped from 232 pilots in 2017 to 21 pilots in 2019. GoAir had hired 109 and 275 pilots in 2017 and 2018 respectively, but in 2019, the airline only hired 179 pilots. Nicolas Dumoulin, MD, Michael Page India said that on a macro level, the overall capacity and operations in the industry had increased. ‚ÄúJet Airways ceased its operations about eight months ago, giving Vistara, SpiceJet, and IndiGo an opportunity to ramp up their capacity, operations, and recruitment. There has also been an increase in domestic travel.‚Äù Currently, 700 odd planes of various manufacturers are operated in India. Low-cost carrier, IndiGo earlier this year had announced firm orders of 300 Airbus aircraft and SpiceJet had placed an order of 205 Boeing aircraft. Full-service carrier, Vistara ordered 50 aircraft from the Airbus A320neo family and announced that it will double its fleet by March 2020.

16,Why a financial planner told me to do nothing with my investments - Business Insider,". A financial planner told me to 'do nothing' with my investments, and it's the best piece of money advice","    Personal Finance Insider writes about products, strategies, and tips to help you make smart decisions with your money. We may receive a small commission from our partners, like American Express, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. Learning about personal finance is one of the smartest, most life-changing moves anyone can make. After all, a proper foundation of financial knowledge can improve your life in immeasurable ways.  Learning how to budget and build an emergency fund can help you create a life without money stress, for example. Plus, learning the best ways to invest for the long haul can mean having more money for retirement or even being able to retire earlier than expected. But when it comes to money knowledge, you can reach a point where you have too much of a good thing. The sheer number of financial apps, investment platforms, and index and mutual fund options is mind-blowing. Plus, there's so much conflicting financial advice on the web ‚Äî and even among financial planners ‚Äî that it's easy to become overwhelmed. San Diego financial planner Taylor Schulte says the investing world is one where it doesn't always pay off to be an overachiever. You might take courses in your spare time to earn certifications for your job, or maybe you work out more often to feel stronger, but you may not want to apply that kind of effort to learning about investing. Why? Because, according to Schulte, taking an overly active approach to your investment and financial plan is unlikely to leave you better off. Like most other financial advisers, Schulte suggests sitting down to create a sound investment and financial plan, preferably with a professional who might offer another set of eyes and some expert guidance. But once you have a financial plan in place, you should really stay the course. Why? He says this is mostly because leaving your money alone gives it a chance to rebound when the market drops over time. Plus, moving your money from place to place in reaction to market trends means you never really give your plan a chance to work. Ready to meet with a professional to set your financial plan?

18,Our Top 5 Stocks of 2019,Our Top 5 Stocks Of 2019. A lot of first-time investors might often only pick the biggest names in the,"Here at MyWallSt, we have so many big-name stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), that some of the best performers can often fall into their shadow.  So here are the 5 companies in the MyWallSt shortlist which made the largest gains in 2019. Coming up to the end of the year, one of the biggest market winners has to be Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), which is up more than 190%* year-to-date, ranking it among the top 4% of stocks on the market in 2019. The e-commerce platform helps individuals and small businesses set up shop online and build their brands.  The company has seen growth since day one on the market back in 2015 and has been putting real pressure on the big dog in e-commerce, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The Canadian company had an extremely impressive Black Friday shopping period at the end of April, where gross merchandise volume reached a record-breaking $900 million and is looking to round off a very impressive year ahead of 2020.  Another big stock making big moves is global tech company The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), which is up more than 125%* in our stock shortlist over the past year. Back in September, it did look as if the company would be swept up in the software pullback that was affecting the market, but it has managed to continue on its massive winning streak.  The stock looks to be backed by analysts moving forward into the new year, which represents a positive outlook for the company. With revenue that has grown more than 50% and earnings up 10%, this tech giant is showing no signs of slowing down. A company that may have fallen under many a radar is SaaS provider Paycom (NYSE: PAYC). The company provides software and cloud-based applications online, focusing on the relatively new sector that businesses term ‚Äúhuman capital management.‚Äù Paycom‚Äôs stock is up more than 110%* in 2019, as it capitalizes on the growing need for software to manage the increasingly complicated realm of human capital.
