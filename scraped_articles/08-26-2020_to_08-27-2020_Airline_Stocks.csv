0,Where Will Airline Stocks Be in 5 Years? | The Motley Fool,Where Will Airline Stocks Be in 5 Years?. Investors interested in buying into airlines today are going to have to,"   The COVID-19 pandemic has caused air travel demand, and airline stock prices, to plummet. And there's little reason to believe conditions will improve anytime soon. That said, air travel isn't going to permanently disappear. And with the stocks off about 30% and 60% year to date, the sector is attracting interest from some investors looking for bargains. I'm bearish on airlines over the next year, and bullish on them over the next decade. Exactly where they will be in the recovery process five years out is much harder to say. But here are three predictions about what commercial aviation will look like in 2025 for those weighing buying in to the sector.  AIRLINE DATA BY YCHARTS Hopefully, by 2025 COVID-19 will be in the past, and although it is likely to take years for travel demand to rebound to pre-pandemic levels, most forecasters are optimistic it will not take five years. Still, expect the scars to be visible on airline balance sheets. The U.S. airline industry has taken on more than $50 billion in new debt so far in 2020, according to Cowen & Co., and airlines are still raising cash. Add in a similar amount of government assistance -- some loans, and some backed by stock warrants -- and it is highly likely that much of whatever free cash flow the industry is generating in 2025 will be earmarked for debt reduction. Dividends are unlikely, and stock buybacks will be limited at best. The airlines will hopefully by 2025 be in a position to take deliveries on some new planes, especially on orders where there is a penalty to pay if they do not take delivery, but few will be focused on expansion. Investors need to view the airlines for the next few years as if they are patients recovering from serious injury. We're still in the triage phase now, but even when that is over there is still a long, painful period of rehab and recovery up ahead. The decade leading up to 2020 was dedicated to empire building, with major U.S. airlines coming out of the last downturn restructured and looking to grow. That led to a series of mergers, and the survivors eager to one-up each other to try to offer the most expansive route networks by flying into second-tier international markets. As mentioned above, debt will likely limit growth in the","Aug 27, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/27/where-will-airline-stocks-be-in-5-years/

MORE IN CNBC TV PICKS.,"(This story is for CNBC Pro subscribers only).  The new rapid test for Covid-19 from Abbott Laboratories could be the development that sparks a turnaround for the travel industry, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Thursday. The medical device company announced on Wednesday night that it received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for a new 15-minute test. Abbott’s stock surged on Thursday morning as some Wall Street analysts called the test a “game changer.”  Cramer said on “Squawk on the Street” that, if not for Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech, the test would be the biggest markets story of the day.

4,The impacts of COVID-19 on the global airline industry: An event study approach,PMC. The impacts of COVID-19 on the global airline industry: An event study approach. . . Abstract. 1. Introduction. 2. Data. 3. Methodology.,"COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation. Get the latest public health information from CDC: https://www.coronavirus.gov Get the latest research information from NIH: https://www.nih.gov/coronavirus Find NCBI SARS-CoV-2 literature, sequence, and clinical content: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/   This study examines the short-term impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on 52 listed airline companies around the world by using event study methodology. The results demonstrate that airline stock returns decline more significantly than the market returns after three major COVID-19 announcements were made. Overall, investors react differently during the three selected events. The strongest overreaction is noted in the post-event period of the World Health Organization's and President Trump's official announcements. Moreover, the findings confirm that traders in Western countries are more responsive to recent information than the rest of the world. The findings call for immediate policy designs in order to alleviate the impact of the pandemic in the airline industry around the globe. The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as the newest global risk has disrupted business operations in all industries. The airline industry is one of the first industries that was affected from the event because the disease is easily passed among people. To date, there is no official medical treatment for the disease, causing a tremendous panic for world citizens. Thus, governments around the world have prohibited cross-country transportation. The market value of the airline business has shrunk since then. Ultimately, this incident motivates us to study the impact of COVID-19 on the performance of the airline industry around the world. Similar events can be seen in the catastrophic shocks from airline disasters (Kaplanski and Levy, 2010), the September 11, 2001 attacks (Gillen and Lall, 2003), and the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on airline stocks (Loh, 2006). A recent study documents the impact of COVID-19 on employment in the airline industry (Sobieralski, 2020), but the impact of the COVID-19 on airline stock prices has not yet been investigated. In order to fill this gap, we aim to examine the airline stock returns during the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first COVID-19 infected case in China on December 31, 2019 (WHO, 2020), we consider three major dates related to COVID-19: (1) the first infected case outside China reported in Thailand (January 13, 2020); (2) the outbreak in Italy (February 21, 2020); and (3) the declaration by WHO on","Aug 27, 2020",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7451055/
5,LUV: Is the Airline Industry on the Road to Recovery?,Is the Airline Industry on the Road to Recovery?. . . About the Author: Aditya Raghunath. More Resources for the,"  LUV – While airline stocks are trading at a discount, there are far too many questions that need to be answered before investors can take a plunge and buy these beaten-down companies. Aug 27, 2020  The airline sector was soaring high and reporting record profits at the start of 2020. Then the COVID-19 pandemic struck, decimating several industries. But the capital-intensive airline companies have been the worst hit. As governments shut down airports and grounded flights, airline companies burnt millions of dollars each day as travel came to a standstill. According to experts, this crisis is unprecedented and many companies have reported billions of dollars in losses for the June quarter. It might take three more years for air traffic and passenger capacity to reach pre-COVID levels which does not bode well for the sector. In 2019, the airline industry reported an average operating margin of 7% while net margins were about 5%. We can see that even an 8% drop in sales will push companies towards an operating loss. 9 ""MUST OWN"" Growth Stocks For 2021 According to a Bloomberg report, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), estimates air carriers to lose a cumulative $84 billion in 2020 and another $16 billion in 2021 due to the pandemic. Comparatively, the total losses in this sector during the financial crisis of 2008-09 stood at $31 billion. The outlook is grim and several airlines might reach out to governments for bailout packages. While lockdowns restrictions are lifted and air traffic has experienced an uptick, the airline industry is grappling with significant debt that stands at a massive $120 billion. As global travel was non-existent, several companies raised debt to pay their fixed costs and maintain operations. However, rising interest costs at a time when revenues have plummeted will burden company financials and increase the risk of default or bankruptcies. IATA warns of record loss for airlines In June, IATA said that the expected decline in passenger revenue has widened to $371 billion, up from its previous forecast of $314 billion in April. IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac said, “Losses this year will be the biggest in aviation history.  There is no comparison for the dimensions of this crisis.” It expects losses to account for between 15% and 30% of sales and airlines should brace for a period of extended losses even if there is no second wave","Aug 27, 2020",https://stocknews.com/news/luv-aal-dal-ual-brk-a-is-the-airline-industry-on-the-road-to-recovery/

7,"Warren Buffett Sold This Canadian Stock: Should You Sell, Too?",. S&P/TSX. S&P 500. DOW. CAD/USD. CRUDE OIL. BTC-CAD. CMC Crypto 200. GOLD FUTURES. RUSSELL 2000. 10-Yr Bond. NASDAQ. VOLATILITY.," It is no secret that the Oracle of Omaha has this innate ability to make market moves that can confuse everybody. We look towards Warren Buffett for his investing decisions, because his immense success serves as a benchmark for every value investor. He gives us a prime example of how you can be successful as an investor if you make the right decisions. Over his decades-long investing career, Buffett has amassed a fortune. In that time, he has made some logically sound moves. He has also made many decisions that seemed confusing at first but made sense in the long run. Consider his stance on airline stocks. Buffett did not invest in airline companies for decades. However, he recently decided to invest in a portfolio of airline stocks and decided he would stick to the investment. A few months later, a pandemic struck and left all the airlines at a standstill. Buffett initially announced he would stick to his investment but dumped his airline stocks as the pandemic continued. The latest stock to fall victim to Buffett’s unpredictable moves is a favourite in the Canadian restaurant business: Restaurant Brands International (TSX:QSR)(NYSE:QSR). Buffett did not disclose his reasons, but he exited his entire position in one of the only two Canadian stocks he owns. The move comes as a surprise to many people, because RBI was on a steady growth projection before the pandemic struck. Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen are three of the most prominent names in the fast-food industry. All three companies come under the umbrella of RBI. Should you consider turning your back on the Canadian restaurant giant as well? I find Buffett’s move confusing, because RBI has been on a strong run. Despite the pandemic, RBI reported a strong quarterly performance with $1.05 billion in sales. The figure translated to $0.33 in earnings per share when the analysts predicted $0.29 earnings per share. The company claimed that it was back to 90% of its prior-year system-wide sales by the end of Q2 2020.

8,Is Second Stimulus On the Way to Rescue US Airlines?,. . . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY.,"                                                   U.S. airlines have been warning of massive job cuts given the approaching expiration of the federal aid on Sep 30, 2020. Thanks to coronavirus, airlines are struggling to stay afloat in a significantly suppressed demand environment.

In April, U.S. airlines received $25 billion in payroll grants under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Airline companies accepting this financial assistance are prohibited from laying off employees through Sep 30. This package was meant to provide some support to airline companies until they somewhat bounce back.

However, with coronavirus concerns continuing unabated, a recovery in air travel demand seems to be a distant possibility and this does not bode well for the aviation industry.  Considering this, the U.S. airlines and the labor unions have requested for a six-month extension of the payroll-support program to protect jobs through March 2021. Despite garnering immense bipartisan support to the extension on grounds that saving jobs in these trying times would mean that the economy would bounce back faster, an agreement hasn’t been reached as yet. So airlines are preparing for the worst. Given the continued softness in travel demand, airlines started pondering over operating on a much smaller scale in the foreseeable future. This would mean reducing workforce and aligning network to match the current demand scenario.

Recently, American Airlines Group AAL, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), revealed that it will have to furlough approximately 19,000 of its employees in October unless the payroll-support program is extended. Of the 19,000 job cuts, 17,500 will impact U.S.-based employees. On the whole, the company’s total workforce (pre-coronavirus levels) will be slashed by 40,000 employees in October. This large number of furloughs has been planned despite thousands of employees having opted for voluntary-separation options. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Earlier, Delta Air Lines DAL had grabbed headlines for similar reasons. The carrier plans to furlough 1,941 pilots in October, which could have been avoided if they had agreed to a 15% cut to their minimum pays. Back in July, United Airlines UAL had alerted 36,000 workers","Aug 27, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/second-stimulus-way-rescue-us-124612077.html
9,Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock: How to Triple Your Money - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock: How to Triple Your Money. Don’t buy this,"      Ryan Vanzo | August 26, 2020 | More on: AC CJT Air Canada (TSX:AC) is a proven long-term winner. In 2012, the stock was under $1. By 2019, it surpassed $50. Patient investors made 50 times their original investment. Of course, all of this was before the pandemic hit. As an airline, Air Canada was crushed. Business and leisure travel plummeted, and on most metrics, haven’t returned. Now priced at $16, shares could triple if conditions improve. But if you want to triple your money, don’t buy Air Canada stock. Everyone is betting on airlines these days. They’re betting these stocks will either skyrocket in value or go completely bankrupt. There really aren’t many futures in between. The reason is simple: these are highly-leveraged, fixed-cost businesses that can’t burn money forever. Last quarter, Air Canada lost more than $1 billion. The quarter before that, it also lost more than $1 billion. This business is a black hole for money right now, and it’s not hard to see why. Passenger traffic is down by 96%. The problem is that things won’t get better any time soon. Polls show that 85% of Canadians want to keep travel restrictions in place. Plus, we’re still at least 12 months away from a fully distributed vaccine. In reality, it could still be years. Meanwhile, Air Canada only has nine quarters of liquidity left. The funny thing is that part of Air Canada is actually growing. It’s a small segment, so it won’t bail out the company, but this startling data point can help you figure out how to profit elsewhere. Airline traffic is plummeting, but it’s primarily caused by declining passenger volumes. Cargo traffic, however, is increasing. It turned out that the pandemic is moving a ton of physical retail sales over to digital. Consumers are shopping online more than ever. “Add Air Canada and IAG Group, parent of British Airways, to the list of passenger airlines that significantly increased cargo revenues in the second quarter even as the coronavirus crisis otherwise destroyed the industry’s finances,” reports FreightWaves. But remember: cargo only constitutes a tiny fraction of revenue for passenger airline stocks. If you want to capitalize, buy Cargojet (TSX:CJT). Cargojet flies under the radar in the investing community because it only ships cargo. It is the largest overnight cargo carrier in Canada, with a stranglehold on the market.","Aug 26, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/26/air-canada-tsxac-stock-how-to-triple-your-money/

Salesforce, Best Buy, Delta, Donald Trump -"," He said at an event hosted by Politico that President Trump is considering executive actions to provide aid to airlines to avoid furloughs if Congress doesn’t do so itself in a new stimulus package, Bloomberg reported. “If Congress is not going to work, this president is going to get to work and solve some problems,” Meadows said. “Hopefully we can help the airlines and keep some of those employees from being furloughed."" Congressional legislation is likely necessary, Meadows said. But the White House is “looking at other executive actions” and intends to implement “a few” additional stimulus measures beyond the package Trump decreed in July, he said, according to Bloomberg. Other major airlines have announced thousands of furloughs and potential layoffs too. Delta Air Lines  (DAL) - Get Report said Monday that it will furlough 1,941 of its 11,200 pilots unless they accept compensation reductions. Delta warned pilots of potential furloughs over the summer. But even after 1,806 pilots accepted early retirement packages, the airline said in a memo it will still have more pilots than it needs to cover a flight schedule slashed by reduced travel demand during the coronavirus pandemic. United Airlines  (UAL) - Get Report told its pilots last month that nearly a third, or 3,900, of them may be furloughed. American shares recently traded at $12.92, down 1.67%; Delta shares recently traded at $29.95, down 0.5%; and United recently traded at $34.73, down 1.39%.

14,SIA Share Price: Is The Stock Worth S$3.75? | IG SG,Is Singapore Airlines (SIA) worth S$3.75 a share?. What’s the stock update on SIA?. . React to global volatility. Why," Although Singapore Airlines’ share price crossed S$3.90 on Tuesday, investment brokers maintain a 9% downside on the stock. The Singapore Airlines (SIA) (SGX: C6L) stock rose 5.6% on Tuesday 25 August 2020, following positive Covid-19 treatment developments and improved US-China trade updates. Share price hit a two-month high of S$3.93, before easing in the afternoon to finish the day at S$3.80. As at 14:30 SGT on Wednesday 26 August 2020, SIA shares are trading at S$3.75 per share on the IG platform – 1.6% above the week’s opening mark. Market volatility continues as coronavirus concerns amplify. Trade with IG and take advantage of: IG’s market data shows that ‘buys’ form 75% of all trades on the SIA counter today and 51% of trades across the week so far. Additionally, 94% of all opened accounts on the stock currently hold ‘buy’ (long) positions, indicating a near-term expectation for SIA’s share price to increase. Singapore Airlines’ share price spike on Tuesday had coincided with the broader uptick in market sentiment across Asia. On Sunday 23 August 2020, US President Donald Trump enacted an emergency authorisation of blood plasma from a recovered Covid-19 patient for expanded treatment use across the country. According to IG analyst Pan Jingyi, the rosy sentiment was also supported by the latest ‘neutral comments’ regarding US-China trade discussions. Leaving details scarce, the US trade representative statement notably outlined that both US and China ‘see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement’. Following these reports, the region’s main indices – from Hang Seng Index to Nikkei 225 – had all opened the day higher. Singapore blue-chip equity benchmark Straits Times Index also rallied over 1% on the day to peak at an intraday high of 2,570.6. Start today by opening a live or demo IG trading account. This latest uptrend is a stark contrast from last Thursday 20 August 2020, when share price had fallen 2.7% after Bloomberg reported that the flagship carried had already burned through half of the S$8.8 billion it had raised through a share sale conducted in June. Of this amount, SIA stated in an SGX filing that S$1.1 billion had been channelled into operating expenses, maturing fuel-hedging trades and ticket refunds from cancelled flights due to the pandemic.
