0,3 Reasons to Buy and Hold Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Forever - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . 3 Reasons to Buy and Hold Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Forever. Air,"      Cindy Dye | June 28, 2019 | More on: AC TRZ WJA Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock is soaring, up 55% since the start of the year. Should you buy the stock at this level? Here are three reasons Air Canada is an excellent choice for the buy-and-hold investor. The Canadian airways are dominated by two carriers: Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. (TSX:WJA). Yesterday it was announced that Air Canada, Canada’s largest airline, will take over Transat A.T. Inc. (TSX:TRZ), Canada’s third-largest airline. The two companies have been in negotiations for 30 days for a merger valued at $13 a share or $520 million. In the news release, the companies said that they plan to maintain the two companies as separate entities and protect the different brands by leaving the head offices and critical functions in Montreal. This deal will give the combined companies approximately 60% of the air travel business in Canada. Despite the higher bid from Montreal real estate developer Group Mach to buy Transat for $14 a share, the company’s management inked the deal with Air Canada on Wednesday evening. The deal still requires approval by two-thirds of Transat shareholders, as well as legal and government approvals. This acquisition comes on the heels of the agreement between WestJet and Onex, an investment management company. Last month WestJet and Onex entered into an agreement in which WestJet will receive $31 per share and operate as a privately held company. The total transaction cost is valued at $3.5 billion. Earlier this week, Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau greenlighted the deal. This hurdle was one of the regulatory challenges the companies faced prior to the deal proceeding. WestJet shareholders will be asked to approve the merger on July 23. New concerns over the Boeing 737 MAX have surfaced. In a series of simulator flights to test new software designed to fix the problem with the plane’s stabilization system, a flaw was discovered. The faulty stabilization system on the Boeing 737 MAX resulted in two plane crashes killing 346 people. Of Air Canada’s fleet of 400 aircraft, the Boeing 737 MAX makes up approximately 6%, transporting approximately 10,000 customers per day. The planes have been removed from Air Canada’s lineup until at least September 2, 2019. The latest concerns with the revised system could delay the plane’s reentry into Air Canada’s fleet even later.

Subsidiaries and alliances[edit]. Destinations[edit]. Codeshare," Iberia (Spanish pronunciation: [iˈβeɾja]), legally incorporated as Iberia, Líneas Aéreas de España, S.A. Operadora, Sociedad Unipersonal, is the flag carrier airline of Spain,[6] founded in 1927. Based in Madrid, it operates an international network of services from its main base of Madrid–Barajas Airport.[7] Iberia, with Iberia Regional (operated by an independent carrier Air Nostrum) and with Iberia Express, is a part of International Airlines Group. In addition to transporting passengers and freight, Iberia Group carries out related activities, such as aircraft maintenance, handling in airports, IT systems and in-flight catering. Iberia Group airlines fly to over 109 destinations in 39 countries, and a further 90 destinations through code-sharing agreements with other airlines.[7] On 8 April 2010, it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia had signed an agreement to merge,[8] making the combined operation the third largest commercial airline in the world by revenue.[9] Shareholders of both carriers approved the deal on 29 November 2010.[10] The newly merged company, known as International Airlines Group (IAG), was established in January 2011, although both airlines continue to operate under their respective brands.[11] Iberia, Compañía Aérea de Transportes was incorporated on 28 June 1927 with a capital investment by the financier Horacio Echevarrieta and Deutsche Luft Hansa of 1.1 million pesetas. Flight operations started on 14 December 1927.[12] Within a year, the company was sponsored by the Spanish government to provide postal transport between Madrid and Barcelona. During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, the aviation companies in Spain were combined and became state-controlled as a general interest public utility, coming into effect in early 1928.[13] As a consequence, Iberia was merged into Compañía de Líneas Aéreas Subvencionadas S.A.

2,American Airlines Prepares to Retire Its Aging MD-80 Fleet | The Motley Fool,"American Airlines Prepares to Retire Its Aging MD-80 Fleet. After nearly four decades of service, the once-ubiquitous McDonnell Douglas MD-80","   For the past several decades, McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets have been a common sight at airports around the world (and especially in the U.S.). However, with production having ended in 1999, even the newest MD-80s are close to retirement age. Furthermore, new models like the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo are dramatically more fuel-efficient -- not to mention a lot quieter. As a result, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), by far the biggest MD-80 customer, has been planning to retire its final MD-80s in 2019. Earlier this week, the airline announced that it had scheduled its final MD-80 flights for Sept. 4. This will leave Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) as the only U.S. passenger airline operating MD-80s. American Airlines was the first major customer for the MD-80. After getting its first handful of MD-80s in 1983 on a bargain deal from a desperate McDonnell Douglas, American used the jet to power its rapid growth during the 1980s and early 1990s. In total, American Airlines ordered 260 MD-80s. Its 2001 merger partner, TWA, was also a major MD-80 operator. As a result, by the end of 2001, American had 362 MD-80s, accounting for 41% of its total mainline fleet. That also represented more than 30% of the 1,191 MD-80s built over the lifetime of the program. No. 2 customer Delta Air Lines ordered a comparatively modest 120 MD-80-series jets. These MD-80s served the bulk of American Airlines' domestic mainline routes. As recently as 2011, American was still operating more than 200 MD-80s. However, in recent years, the carrier has undertaken a massive fleet renewal project, replacing older aircraft with brand-new jets from Boeing and Airbus. AMERICAN AIRLINES HAS ADDED HUNDREDS OF NEW PLANES TO ITS FLEET SINCE 2013. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. By the beginning of 2019, American Airlines was down to just 30 MD-80s and planned to get rid of the rest by year-end. On Monday, the airline revealed that it will retire the final 26 MD-80s on Sept. 4, just after the end of the summer peak travel season. The final flight -- sentimentally numbered AA 80 -- will depart the airline's Dallas-Fort Worth hub at 9 a.m. on that date and arrive in Chicago at 11:35. There's still a chance that American Airlines will need to revise its timeline for retiring its last MD-80s. It's no coincidence that the scheduled retirement date of Sept. 4","Jun 27, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/27/american-airlines-prepares-to-retire-its-aging-md.aspx

The risk/reward ratio doesn't look good for","The bad news keeps on coming for Boeing (BA) . First, we learned Wednesday that the firm is reportedly in discussions with client airlines about potentially reimbursing them for losses suffered from the Boeing 737 Max's international grounding following two deadly crashes. United Continental (UAL) has already stated that the airline has pulled all of its 737-Max planes from scheduling for the rest of the summer. American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) are also known to be heavily exposed to the model. Then later Wednesday, Boeing shares became extremely volatile going into the close after word emerged that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration asked the firm to address a new problem with the 737 Max. The issue is unrelated an ongoing software fix for the 737's MCAS flight-control system that some suspect caused the two deadly crashes. Hopefully, this new issue will involve simply correcting some software as well. But published reports indicate that BA might have to replace a computer chip in all 737 Max aircraft, including those that the company has already delivered. The problem for Boeing is that many had expected the 737 Max's recertification flight tests to commence last week. That testing is necessary prior to regulators across the globe giving their blessing for the troubled model to return to the skies. But obviously, delays to getting these planes back into operation will be more extensive than previously thought. United's recent cancellation of flights that use the 737 Max only run through Labor Day, but the FAA will need weeks to review the 737 Max's recertification tests. Does this mean you should buy BA on the dip that we're seeing Thursday -- a 2.4% drop as I write this? Not with my money it doesn't. It's not that I don't believe that Boeing will overcome this current environment -- in fact, I'm sure it eventually will. It's just that the risk/reward ratio doesn't look so hot for retail investors. It's one thing if you're a hedge fund running $1 billion for a bunch of rich guys. If you lose money on BA, maybe you can replenish it. But if this is your rent or grocery money, you can't get caught out in the open if more bad news hits.

HIGHLIGHT. E-PAPER. . . . .,"  HÀ NỘI — Thiên Minh Aviation Joint Stock Company was granted business registration to establish an airline with charter capital of VNĐ1 trillion (US$43 million), becoming the sixth airline in the country. According to the business registration, the company which is a subsidiary of Thiên Minh Group (TMG), one of Việt Nam's leading travel and hospitality companies, would have headquarters in Hội An, central province of Quảng Nam. Three main shareholders include Thiên Minh Tourism JSC with 30 per cent of shares, Trần Trọng Kiên – the group’s chairman with 60 per cent and Trần Hằng Thu with 10 per cent. The business registration allows the company to operate in seven sectors including aviation passenger and goods transport, and aircraft leasing. Kiên will be the chairman and general director of the company. He is now also general director of the Hải Âu Aviation Joint Stock Company, established in 2011. The firm provides seaplane tourism activities and air taxi services. Earlier, in April, AirAsia announced an end to co-operation with Thiên Minh Group to establish a low-cost airline in Việt Nam after one year of negotiation. Kiên at that time said that he would continue to pursue the establishment of an airline in another way. Currently, Việt Nam’s aviation market has five airlines including Vietnam Airlines, Vietjet Air, Jetstar, VASCO and Bamboo Airways. Vietstar Airlines and Vietravel Airlines also expected to launch an airline in Việt Nam. However, Vietstar Airlines is waiting for licence though it was established in 2016 with charter capital of VNĐ300 billion. Another newcomer - tourism company Vietravel Group - has recently also made the first moves to establish its own airline, sending documents on establishing Viettravel Airline to the central province of Thừa Thiên-Huế Department of Transport.

Indian travellers are,"Indian travellers are increasingly opting for Singapore Airlines’ non-stop services to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York from Singapore, says David Lim, the airline’s general manager, India. In an interview with FE’s Mithun Dasgupta, Lim says the airline, which is nearing 50 years of operations in India, aims to maintain a young fleet that allows for increased operational efficiencies. Excerpts: Singapore Airlines has commenced its Airbus A350 services from three Indian cities – Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata. The airline has introduced the luxurious aircraft, replacing Airbus A330. What are the reasons behind it? Why has firstly these three cities been selected? Singapore Airlines aims to maintain a young fleet that allows for increased operational efficiencies as well as catering to the travellers’ current needs. Currently, the average age of our fleet is six years and four months. In line with this commitment, the airline has a firm order of 67 Airbus A350 and 49 Boeing 787-10 aircraft, which will progressively replace our existing Airbus A330 and Boeing 777-200 aircraft. We review each sector based on operational needs and market demand; based on which the most suitable aircraft is deployed on the route. What are your plans on expanding Airbus A350 services from other Indian cities? We have no immediate announcements to make. How has the airline’s operations been growing in India in terms of revenue and air traffic? What are your business growth plans here for the next two-three years? Going ahead, how many new international flights are the airline expected to offer? The SIA group, which includes Singapore Airlines, SilkAir and low-cost arm Scoot, offers over 140 weekly services from India to Singapore. Globally, we connect to 62 destinations in 32 countries and territories. Singapore Airlines is nearing 50 years of operations in India and the market has shown positive growth through these years. With our recent non-stop services to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York from Singapore, Indian travellers are increasingly considering travelling west through the east. Our next non-stop route to Seattle will be a destination that will excite the Indian market.

11,5 Great Buffett Blue Chips | Seeking Alpha,5 Great Buffett Blue Chips. How I Built This List. The Best Buffett Stocks To Buy Right Now. A Better,"Warren Buffett has proven himself the best investor of all time, which, combined with his nearly 80 years of experience, is why many investors closely track his holdings each quarter. While it's not necessarily a great idea to mirror institutional investors precisely, if you find someone whose investing philosophy aligns with yours, their holdings can provide good ideas. Buffett's dedication to wide moat businesses, run by good to great management, and desire to buy at fair value or better, matches my overall strategy. Right now, WFC, DAL, LUV, BAC, and BK are the most undervalued Buffett Dividend blue-chips you can buy. Just remember that all investing is probabilistic, so always use good risk management and maintain a well-diversified portfolio with the proper asset allocation that's most likely to meet your needs. This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community,The Dividend Kings. (Source: imgflip) Warren Buffett is the best investor in history, with 20.5% CAGR total returns over 54 years running Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B). While Buffett started out in the Benjamin Graham ""cigar butt"" deep value school, he later evolved his strategy (thanks to Charlie Munger's influence) as summarized by his famous quote ""it's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price."" Buffett's idea of a wonderful company includes both his love of moats (enduring competitive advantages that keep profitability strong over time) but also his desire for great management. ""Over time, the skill with which a company's managers allocate capital has an enormous impact on the enterprise's value...Charlie and I look for companies that have…able and trustworthy management."" Given his famous ability to deliver great returns through dedication to quality, value, and above all, patience (his favorite time horizon is ""forever""), it's not difficult to understand why so many investors track Berkshire's portfolio each quarter when its 13-F comes out. While you should never exactly mirror any institutional investor precisely, I do consider what companies Berkshire owns to be a good screening tool, of what he and his disciples (Todd and Ted) consider to be quality companies to put on your watchlist. Which is why I decided to highlight the best five Buffett blue-chip dividend stocks to buy today. For this list, I checked which 32 companies Berkshire currently owns, and then screened for those that pay a dividend.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Guadeloupe’s Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport (PTP) (a). Three times weekly service is expected to launch in February 2020 with seats set to go on sale in the coming weeks. “With its combination of French flair and Caribbean coolness, Guadeloupe will offer our customers an all-new and exciting destination to escape to this winter,” said Andrea Lusso, director route planning, JetBlue. “We continue to build our New York focus city strategy and by adding another unique destination we reinforce our position in the Caribbean, where JetBlue continues to serve more nonstop destinations from JFK than any other carrier.” JetBlue will be the only airline to operate flights between the northeastern U.S. and Guadeloupe, one of the French overseas islands, which is often considered one of the Caribbean’s best-kept secrets.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Siddarth Shrikanth in Hong Kong Shares in Garuda Indonesia slid on Friday after the country's financial regulator and stock exchange ordered the airline to “repair and restate” its annual accounts, weeks after its two biggest private shareholders alleged it had misrepresented a $240m transaction. The flag carrier's stock price fell as much as 7.6 per cent to its lowest level since January after Indonesia’s financial services authority, known as OJK, ordered the company to fix unspecified errors in its 2018 annual accounts and submit a corrected version within 14 days.  However, the regulator imposed only modest sanctions on the airline's board, fining each of the directors Rp100m ($7,083) for the violations. OJK added that the accounting firm Tanubrata, Sutanto, Fahmi, Bambang & Partners, a unit of the global auditor BDO, would have its licence frozen for a year.  Shortly after the order, the Indonesia Stock Exchange issued a statement saying it had asked the airline to restate its interim financial report for the first quarter of 2019. The exchange also said it would impose a Rp250m fine.  Garuda, which is majority state-owned, had been hit by allegations of financial wrongdoing in April from two of the company's largest private shareholders, CT Corp and Finegold Resources.  The companies published a letter saying they had taken issue with the way the airline had forward-booked earnings from a deal with a technology provider in October 2018, saying it should have shown an additional $240m loss, according to Reuters. At the time, chief financial officer Fuad Rizal dismissed the allegations, saying the inclusion of revenues from the deal was in line with accounting standards. However, Friday's order from OJK will add to growing pressure on the airline's management, who have been battling to turn around the struggling carrier.  Garuda posted a modest $5.02m net profit on $4.37bn of revenues in its 2018 annual report that is now under question. That figure, which could now slip back into negative territory after revisions, came after a $213.4m net loss in 2017.

15,Allegiant Air has expanded into some unusual side businesses | Las Vegas Review-Journal,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Allegiant Ventures. ," Allegiant Air boss Maurice “Maury” Gallagher likes to do things differently. His deep-discount carrier flies from small, underserved cities to warm-weather vacation spots, usually without competition on its routes. It charges $5 to print a boarding pass at airports, parks planes on light travel days, and doesn’t offer coffee on-board. Allegiant is also the only U.S. airline with side businesses that aren’t directly related to air travel, analysts told the Review-Journal – and its push outside aviation has left plenty of observers scratching their heads. Las Vegas-based Allegiant Travel Co., the carrier’s parent, is developing a 22-acre resort in Port Charlotte, Florida, a town that, as one local put it, is “nothing really special.” The company has also opened two arcades – one in Utah and another in Michigan – featuring laser tag and bumper cars, and plans more locations; owns a golf-course-management software business; and has talked about managing other hotels in Florida. In some ways, the expansion isn’t a surprise, given who’s in charge. Gallagher, chairman and CEO of Allegiant Travel, has a history of personal side ventures. His interests have included a roadside Las Vegas wedding chapel and businesses that inked millions of dollars in deals with his airline, including a race-car team and a television game show filmed on Allegiant flights. The next two years, Gallagher said this spring, will be “investment years” for the company’s non-airline projects. “Why are you spending any capital and company focus on golf course software and Dave & Buster’s-like game rooms?” Evercore airline analyst Duane Pfennigwerth asked Allegiant executives during a January earnings call, adding the ventures “might be interesting experiments” but questioned why shareholders are paying for them. “Well, we look at the synergistic value,” Allegiant President John Redmond replied, though before he finished his thoughts, Pfennigwerth interrupted. “John, John, I’m sorry. … I’ve covered Allegiant for a long time. There is no synergy between golf-course-management software” and the airline, he said. Why are you spending any capital and company focus on golf course software and Dave & Buster’s-like game rooms? Duane Pfennigwerth The airline is a consistent money maker: Allegiant Travel in 2018 booked its 16th straight year of profitability, earning almost $162 million in net income. But investors are concerned “all these other side businesses will take management focus away from the most important part” of the company, Raymond James & Associates airline analyst Savi Syth","Jun 28, 2019",https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/allegiant-air-has-expanded-into-some-unusual-side-businesses-for-an-airline-1696066/

Facebook. . LinkedIn. . Twitter. .","The company that owns Air Transat has agreed to be taken over by Air Canada for $13 a share. The two companies announced in May they had entered negotiations toward a possible deal, and gave themselves 30 days to hammer out the details. That period expired on Wednesday, and on Thursday morning they announced a deal that would see Air Canada buy Transat A.T. Inc. for $13 per share, which values the company at $520 million. The plan is to maintain the two companies as separate entities, maintaining the two different brands, head offices and key functions in Montreal, the companies said in a release. ""This combination delivers excellent value, while also providing increased job security for both companies' employees through greater growth prospects,"" Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu said. Transat CEO Jean-Marc Eustache said the deal represents ""the ideal platform for Transat's presence and jobs in Montreal, and therefore represents the best option for all our stakeholders: employees, suppliers, partners and shareholders."" That's a veiled reference to another, ostensibly better financial offer on the table for the company. Once word of Air Canada's interest emerged in May, Montreal real estate developer Group Mach declared it would also be interested in buying Transat, for a higher price of $14 a share. Other bidders, including Montreal-based investment firm FNC Capital, have also expressed an interest in buying Transat, with FNC saying as recently as this week it thinks Transat is worth at least between $17 and $20 a share. ""I have informed my group that according to my presentiment, this potentially historical transaction shall not be done under 18 dollars a share,"" FNC founder and president Dominik Pigeon said this week. ""This will most likely be a hard and long contest, far more [fraught] than what people currently expect."" Mach reiterated their interest and desire in entering negotiations as recently as this week, but Thursday's news suggests Air Transat's management has no interest in pursuing that option. While the merger of the two Montreal-based airlines has the blessing of both companies' management teams, it is far from a done deal. Shareholders will have to weigh in and regulatory agencies will have a say, as the move would consolidate Canada's airline industry in even fewer hands. Canada's Competition Bureau confirmed to CBC News on Thursday it's aware of the share agreement and plans to review it.

17,How to Avoid Baggage Fees | Spending | US News,How to Avoid Baggage Fees. Sidestep hefty add-on fees and discover which airlines offer free checked bags.. Choose an Airline,"MONEY                 Travelers should consider paying for baggage online when booking their ticket or selecting an airline that doesn't charge a baggage fee.(GETTY IMAGES) THE AMERICAN AIRLINE industry brought in $1.3 billion in baggage fee revenue during the first quarter of 2019, about $170 million more than the first quarter of 2018, according to a recent report from the U.S. Department of Transportation. RELATED CONTENT Spend Less on Food While Traveling Unfortunately for travelers, the uptick in baggage fee costs and industry profits isn't because more passengers are flying, but because airlines have been raising prices. JetBlue, American Airlines and United Airlines were among the airlines that increased baggage fees last year. Today, most major carriers charge $30 for the first checked piece of luggage and $40 for the second. However, you can still dodge unnecessary extra baggage fees with a few key pointers. Here's how to avoid baggage fees: READ: Before you book your flight, consider which domestic and international airlines impose baggage fees. For instance, the only domestic airline that does not charge a fee for checked luggage is Southwest Airlines. The carrier allows each passenger to check up to two bags for free (provided the piece of luggage is no heavier than 50 pounds and the maximum size isn't over 62 inches; the oversized baggage fee is $75 per bag). If you decide to fly with an airline that imposes a baggage fee, keep in mind, you'll likely pay around $30 per bag or more. For example, United and Delta both charge $30 for the first checked bag, $40 for a second checked bag and $150 for additional pieces of luggage. ""Credit cards are a huge help when it comes to managing baggage fees for every type of traveler,"" says Brad Chase, owner of the Los Angeles-based travel consulting website, ChaseGlobalTravelGroup.com. Chase says that many airline branded credit cards will allow you to check in your luggage for free. For instance, American Airlines has several credit cards that will waive your checked bag fees. The Barclays AAdvantage Aviator Red World Elite Mastercard, as an example, offers cardholders a free checked bag for domestic flights – and waived checked baggage fees for up to four traveling companions. So if that cardholder has a family of five, each of them could bring along a","Jun 28, 2019",https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/spending/articles/how-to-avoid-baggage-fees
