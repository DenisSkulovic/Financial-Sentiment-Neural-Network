0,Ryanair Stock Analysis - When Is This Stock A Buy? - Sven Carlin,Ryanair Stock Analysis – When Is This Stock A Buy?. Categories. SHARE THIS. RECENT POSTS. . . . . .,"I’ve been marginally following Ryanair for a few years now. When a CEO states: “If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet, I’d carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver.”  It means that he is dedicated to the business. Nevertheless, I always look at risk versus reward and Ryanair was always a bit too expensive for me in the past. Over the past months however, the stock is down significantly and it is time to do a deep research into the business, to see whether it is undervalued and a good investment, or the business model is not strong enough to mark it a long-term investment opportunity. We know airlines are not renowned for being the best businesses in the world but you never know, Buffett bought 4 of them a few years ago.  2020 COVID-19 Update: Buffett sold his airlines because the business is too risky, plus, you can’t really have a moat as the barriers to entry are small. With that line of though, I have been researching airport stocks, that offer a moat, have high margins and give a similar, if not better exposure to the global air traffic growth trend. AIRPORT STOCKS LIST WITH ANALYSIS To value Ryanair, we have to look at: The recent news on Ryanair has been mostly negative The news has been bad over the last two years for Ryanair: All of the above shows how the airline industry is tough, something we’ll discuss in a moment. The same issues forced Ryanair to lower prices as the average ticket sold fell from EUR 39 to 37 and consequently net income fell to 1 billion. However, the sky isn’t that dark. Ryanair’s short term and long-term outlook Ryanair’s CEO clearly states that the fare environment will be weak going ahead. But things are not all bad. There have been some bankruptcies in Europe over the last years which allows Ryanair to grow and get more slots. It is expected that there will be more divestments and perhaps other opportunities for Ryanair to scale as it recently did by acquiring Lauda for 50 million EUR and further investments. Now that the company is unionized and both a Boing and Airbus operator, it can participate in consolidations. Another positive will be the delivery of newer Boing 737Max planes with 4% more seats and 16% better fuel","Jul 15, 2019",https://svencarlin.com/ryanair-stock-analysis-not-a-buy-yet-but-a-stock-to-watch/

4,US stocks rise to record highs – four experts on what to watch now,US stocks rise to record highs – four experts on what to watch now. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips.,"It was a record-breaking week for U.S. stocks. For the first time in history, the Dow broke above 27,000 points, while the S&P 500 crossed the 3,000 mark. The record highs came after the Federal Reserve strongly suggested rate cuts were coming later this month. However, declines in global growth and the remaining trade uncertainty with China have added uncertainty to the market. Those gains also follow the best June in decades. With second-quarter earnings season approaching, can the optimism continue to hold on? Four experts share what lies ahead. Divine Capital CEO Danielle Hughes says one corner of the market isn’t joining in on the rally, and it’s giving her pause.  With the S&P breaking out, NASDAQ breaking out, Russell still is not giving me that conviction that we really have the follow through, I think. And you know, we’re neck deep in extra innings and, I think, that we’ve been waiting for a pullback for so long—we had a tiny one in December that everybody turned around and wishes was back. So, I don’t think that the Fed is defending the markets in any way, shape or form. I think that the Fed is probably looking much more at the global macro. And looking at the fact that there’s slowdowns in many big countries [like] China [and] India... The consumer is not happy. They’re not buying autos, for example. So, we’re having some issues globally. Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown sees a better way to look at market strength than the S&P 500. The breakouts that we’re seeing in big, important, global stocks like Nike and Disney, you look at Starbucks, the chips now coming back— way, way more important than a huge bank index, like the Russell. And by the way, the best evidence of that, all you have to do [is] look at the S&P 500 equal weight index versus the market cap weight index. The equal weight S&P is keeping up with the market cap weighted index. And that to me, is a way better sign of the breath of market strength than it is to look at the Dow Transports, for example, or Small Cap 600 or Russell 2000. Stephanie Link, managing director at Nuveen, said she is looking forward to earnings, but is remaining cautious until she has more economic data: We have some data to get through over the coming","Jul 14, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/12/us-stocks-rise-to-record-highs-four-experts-on-what-to-watch-now.html

10,Congo confirms 1st Ebola case in city of Goma,. . . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY.,"                                                   BENI, Congo (AP) — The Congolese health ministry confirmed an Ebola case in Goma late Sunday, marking the first time the virus has reached the city of more than 2 million people along the border with Rwanda since the epidemic began nearly a year ago. The health ministry said the man who had arrived earlier Sunday in the regional capital had been quickly transported to an Ebola treatment center. Authorities said they had tracked down all the passengers on the bus the man took to Goma from Butembo, one of the towns hardest hit by the disease. ""Because of the speed with which the patient was identified and isolated, and the identification of all the other bus passengers coming from Butembo, the risk of it spreading in the rest of the city of Goma is small,"" the health ministry said in a statement. The virus has killed more than 1,600 people in Congo and two others who returned home across the border to neighboring Uganda. Health experts have long feared that it could make its way to Goma, which is located on the Rwandan border. The health ministries in Congo's neighbors have been preparing for months for the possibility of cases, and frontline health workers already have been vaccinated. The confirmed case announced late Sunday in eastern Congo involves a pastor who became ill last Tuesday. He then left Butembo on a bus, and arrived at a health center Sunday showing symptoms of Ebola, the health ministry said. Violent attacks against health workers and treatment facilities have greatly compromised efforts to combat the epidemic in Butembo. Eastern Congo is home to a myriad of armed groups, and Mai Mai militia fighters are active near the hardest hit towns. Health teams have been unable to access violent areas to vaccinate people at risk of infection and to bring infected patients into isolation. Other times the violence against health teams has come from residents who do not want their loved ones taken to treatment centers or buried in accordance with guidelines aimed at reducing Ebola transmission.

12,Can You Get Rich From Stocks? (Investing & Trading),Can You Get Rich From Stocks? (Investing & Trading). Why It’s Possible to Get Rich Investing In Stocks. Long-term wealth,"Last Updated on 17 November, 2020 by Samuelsson You may have heard several stories about the stock market: the good, the bad, the ugly, and sometimes, the extremely good. So you may be wondering if it’s possible to become rich from stocks. Yes, you can get rich from stocks if you start early, think long-term, begin with a sizeable capital, and regularly add to your investment. And the good thing is, you don’t need to know much about individual stocks before you can start investing. There is more to investing in stocks than buying a couple of shares. In this article, we will discuss the different ways you can invest in stocks, the need for diversification, and other tips for building wealth, but first, you need to know why investing in stocks can help you grow wealth. Getting Rich From Stocks The stock market is not just a place to make some extra income; it has made several millionaires and even billionaires over the years. As a matter of fact, with the right skills and mindset, you can be on the path to becoming a millionaire. Although the market is known for its inherent uncertainty, there’s no easier path to riches than investing in stocks. There has been a lot of success stories to prove that, and it only takes one good investment — held long enough — to change your own story. But you need to understand that it takes time to accumulate wealth. The secret to investing your way to riches lies not in quick flash gains but in the accumulation of market returns over a long time. So, to understand why you can grow wealth in the stock market, let’s explore the following: As the great scientist, Albert Einstein, once noted, the principle of compounding is one of the greatest wonders of the world — whoever understands it, earns with it, and whoever doesn’t, pays for it. In other words, it’s either you’re building wealth with it (compounding your returns on investments), or you’re paying for it because your money keeps losing value due to inflation. The principle of compounding makes it possible to earn a return on a previous return in addition to the return on the initial capital. It gave rise to compound interest, which is the interest you earn on both the initial capital and the previously earned interest. As an investor, you can","Jul 14, 2019",https://therobusttrader.com/can-you-get-rich-from-stocks-investing-trading/

14,Did GM stock owners lose money on GM's chapter 11 reorganization in 2009? - Quora,,"The shareholders lost everything. GM (General Motors) was a $50 stock that went to zero — they went bankrupt — belly up! I think the government didn’t like the fact that there would be only 2 American car companies left: Chrysler and Ford. GM did start over. I was shocked when I heard their stock was starting again at $30 a share. Why did they get to do that? Reorganization you say? What really happened, was they took $2,000,000,000.00 (two billion) of the government’s money (bailout) in the crisis of 2008–2009, they spent it on who knows what — then they went bankrupt shortly after — the stock         Lost lots. That happens in bankruptcy. Not just common stock, preferred stocks were wiped out and bond holders got cut as well. If you had GM before the BK, and still hold now, it is worthless. BTW, index funds that held it lost as well. In 30years as an investment advisor, I saw many companies go BK, ( I didn’t have to own it to watch it) but it surprised me all the people that wanted to buy a stock AFTER the BK filing! “It’s so cheap, they will survive”. Yes some airlines, banks, GM, Chrysler, Enron filed, some came out others didn’t. But we hold good stocks, by definition a company that fil  Christoffer’s answer is correct. I was a GM shareholder when they went bankrupt. I received shares of MTLQQ which I ended up selling for 17 cents a share. I was probably lucky to get that much out of it. In a bankruptcy common share holders at at the bottom of the list for any value remaining. The government is of course at the top of the list. Secured creditors would come next, then unsecured creditors, bond holders and any preferred stockholders. Once they got 100% of their money then the common shareholders would get anything left over. I may have something out of order but you get the idea.   Equity interests in a chapter 11 debtor are almost invariably worthless and will receive no distribution as the company emerges from bankruptcy. Avoid the temptation to buy the shares of a chapter 11 debtor “because they are cheap and the government will not let them fail.” That truly is a “fool’s game.” Yes.","Jul 14, 2019",https://www.quora.com/Did-GM-stock-owners-lose-money-on-GMs-chapter-11-reorganization-in-2009
15,"As IndiGo promoters lock horns, here’s why ‘pan ki dukaan’ is making headlines - The Financial Express","As IndiGo promoters lock horns, here’s why ‘pan ki dukaan’ is making headlines. Even as IndiGo spat deepens with the","Even as IndiGo spat deepens with the government asking SEBI to probe the role of all board members and every entity linked to promoters’ groups, ‘pan ki dukaan’ (betel shop) is making headlines for some interesting reason. It all started when one of the warring partners and airline co-founder Rakesh Gangwal, who holds 37 per cent in IndiGo, complained to the capital markets regulator SEBI over questionable corporate governance practices, alleging that even a `paan ki dukaan’ would have handled things better. He levelled charges against the other Rahul Bhatia, co-promoter and holder of 38 per cent shareholding in the airline, questioning multiple related-party contracts between IndiGo and latter’s InterGlobe Enterprises. On Friday, Rahul Bhatia replied to the allegations as much ado about nothing. His group said that the company is well run, financially sound and managed by competent set of managers. His InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) said that the “Paan ki dukaan has apparently done well and continues to do well; it is financially sound; it is well run and managed by a competent set of managers.” Also read: Facebook slapped with $5 billion fine by US regulators in privacy probe: Report The two founders have entered into a public fight over the balance of power in IndiGo. Rakesh Gangwal had earlier publicly questioned the corporate governance and ethics of the airline on issue of related party transactions with IGE, a holding company of IndiGo. However, Rahul Bhatia’s group has said that the transactions are a fraction of the revenue of the India’s largest airline. “Corporate governance is not about levelling baseless charges. It is about ensuring that the company’s interests are also those of other stakeholders are protected and not harmed,” IFE said in a statement. Shares of InterGlobe Aviation closed Friday at Rs 1,348, down 6.50, or 0.48 per cent on NSE.
