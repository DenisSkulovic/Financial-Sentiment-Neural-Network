0,Should You Buy Air Canada? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Should You Buy Air Canada?. Can Air Canada fly even higher?. Another,"      Demetris Afxentiou | July 6, 2019 | More on: AC Airline stocks have enjoyed a phenomenal ride over the past few years. Air Canada (TSX:AC) in particular, has enjoyed gains of over 300% in the past three-year period. Currently, Air Canada is trading shy of $42, just short of its 52-week high. Despite that current level, there’s still significant upside for those investors looking to invest in Canada’s largest airline. Much of Air Canada’s recent gain can be attributed back to two separate, yet related events that shook the Canadian airline industry. The first was the announcement that Air Canada’s primary competitor in the Canadian market, WestJet, would be sold off and taken private in a multi-billion dollar deal, which leaves investors searching for a Canadian airline investment with fewer options to consider. The second announcement was Air Canada’s own move to acquire the third-largest airline in the country, Transat A.T.  Transat’s scheduled and charter flight network dovetails nicely somewhere between Air Canada’s primary service and its Rouge network. Long-term investors should see this deal as holding massive potential for the airline that comes in the form of less competition, higher airline fees, and access to a larger route network. I won’t even touch the potential synergies that could stem from a deal of this size, but needless to say, they could be huge. The most recent quarterly update Air Canada provided was back in May for the first fiscal of 2019. In that quarter, Air Canada reported operating income of $127 million, surpassing the $86 million reported in the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter came in at a record-breaking amount of $4.453 billion, reflecting an improvement of $382 million over the same quarter last year. Most impressively, the airline reported net income of $345 million for the quarter, handily being the $203 million loss reported last year. Free cash flow came in at $579 million during the first quarter, surpassing the $318 million posted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The much-improved results were attributed to a variety of factors, such as increases in system passenger revenues and overall traffic, as well as the airline’s commitment to cost-cutting. Finally, Air Canada’s efforts at lowering the net debt also bore fruit in the quarter, with the airline realizing a drop in net debt of $1,731 million over the same","Jul 6, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/07/06/should-you-buy-air-canada/
1,3 Transportation Stock Picks for July - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . 3 Transportation Stock Picks for July. Ride the rails. Keep riding. Hit,"      Ryan Vanzo | July 5, 2019 | More on: CNI CP CNR CP MTL Transportation stocks fuel the entire economy. From railroads to highways, moving goods throughout the country supports nearly every individual and business. It should come as no surprise that many transportation stocks have made investors incredibly rich over the years. Some have multi-decade histories of outperformance. A select few are true millionaire-maker stocks. Want to get your slice of the pie? Here are your three top options this summer. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (TSX:CP)(NYSE:CP) is basically a monopoly. In many cases, businesses don’t have an alternative to using its services. That was especially true during Alberta’s oil glut debacle, when producers were forced to use massive amounts of crude-by-rail. What’s the number one sign of a monopoly? Pricing power. Over the last 10 years, Canadian Pacific’s revenues have only increased by 4.3% annually. Profits, meanwhile, have grown by 13.5% per year. Since 2014, free cash flow per share has nearly doubled. From a financial standpoint, Canadian Pacific has been one of the strongest performers on the TSX. While there should be some bumps along the way, the power of railroads will continue to strengthen. In most cases, apart from regions with ample waterways, rail is simply the most cost-effective way to ship goods. That’s not changing anytime soon. Shares trade at less than 19 times forward earnings—a discount to its five-year average. Looking for another monopoly stock? Check out Canadian National Railway Company (TSX:CNR)(NYSE:CNI). Over the last decade, shares of Canadian National have delivered a total return of roughly 550%. Canadian Pacific only achieved total returns of around 450%. Still, both companies trounced the S&P/TSX Composite Index return of just 120%. Canadian National controls several key routes that should see long-term demand growth. Its dominant market share in Western Canada, including Edmonton, Prince Rupert, Vancouver, Prince George, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg should allow it to capitalize on limited transportation infrastructure for energy projects, especially given that the company has export access to ocean terminals like New Orleans and Halifax. Today, shares trade at 20 times earnings at writing. Over the next three to five years, analysts expect EPS to grow by 11% per year. Assuming the valuation multiple doesn’t change, we could be looking at 70% upside or more by 2024. Mullen Group Ltd. (TSX:MTL) isn’t another railroad stock. Instead, its focus","Jul 5, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/07/05/3-transportation-stock-picks-for-july/
2,Strong June jobs report sends stocks lower—5 experts on what's next,Strong June jobs report sends stocks lower—5 experts explain what comes next. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"The June jobs report crushed expectations. On Friday, the Labor Department announced 224,000 new jobs were added to the U.S. economy, versus the market’s expectation of 165,000. After months of slowing job growth, the jump came as a surprise to many. The unemployment rate increased slightly to 3.7% from 3.6% in May. The outsized payroll growth confused the market, which is anticipating an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month. Stocks fell in response to the move, while investor expectations of a 25-basis-point cut in July rose to 91% from just above 70%. With the Fed closely watching these numbers, there is a lot of uncertainty for what this job report could mean for investors. Here’s what five experts think comes next: Kenny Polcari, managing principal at Butcher Joseph Asset Management, said the market will likely slow down, but better days are ahead, especially if a trade deal comes soon: “You can’t ever fight the Fed. And if we’re still having that conversation about this pending rate cut coming at the end of July then I would suspect you might see the market back off a little bit today just because you had such a strong number, so maybe there’s a question about, are they going to do it? Is it going to be 50 [basis points]? Is it going to be 25? What did the market expect versus what they think they’re going to get now? And so, therefore, you may see some churn. But, in the end, I think that it’s going to find plenty of support. Look, the other economic data is not as weak as everyone’s making it out to be. I think the economy feels like it’s chugging along just fine and so therefore I do think that there are better days ahead. But in the short term, there’s a fair amount of noise, a lot of it around the report today, a lot of it around, certainly, trade, which will be on going. But, look, if we get a trade deal in the next 25 days before the Fed meeting, you could see, in my opinion, the whole Fed cut rate thing come right off the table, because strong economic jobs number, you got a trade deal that really looks like it’s going to work — the Fed may take a second and say, ‘You know what?

Nonfarm payrolls rose by 224,000 jobs last month, the most in five months, the Labor Department data showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 160,000 jobs in June. The closely watched employment report led investors to scale back bets of a 50 basis point rate cut by the central bank at its policy meeting on July 30-31. However, moderating wage growth and mounting evidence that the economy was slowing sharply could still encourage the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter point. ""It is still more likely than not that the Fed will cut rates but the odds have decreased somewhat,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. ""The 50 basis point cut should be priced out completely at this point."" Wall Street's main indexes have rallied to record levels on hopes of a looser monetary policy from the Fed and other major central banks in the wake of a slowdown in global growth.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   CAIRO, July 6 (Reuters) - Benin woke up on Saturday still pinching themselves after an extraordinary win at the Africa Cup of Nations as they rode their luck to eliminate highly fancied Morocco on penalties in the last 16. ""We dream of victories every day and I believe we can continue this beautiful dream,"" said coach Michel Dussuyer after the small west African nation won 4-1 on penalties after holding Morocco to a 1-1 draw following extra time on Friday. Benin achieved success despite conceding a last gasp penalty after the end of 90 minutes, which Morocco missed, and then playing most of the extra time period down to 10 men. ""I'm very proud of my team. We had a difficult challenge. Morocco are a very strong team but we prepared well mentally and luck was on our side,"" added the journeyman French coach, in charge of a motley collection of players including one from Yeovil Town in League Two. ""Playing with a man less was difficult, and we will try to make amends for the absence of Khaled Adenon, who will miss next game."" ""This is the greatest achievement in the history of Benin football,"" added veteran striker Mikael Pote, who was in the squad when Benin last competed at the same tournament in Angola nine years ago. ""We've come down to earth a little even if the emotion is still high. What we did was historic, it was beautiful,"" added the 34-year-old, who played in Turkey's second division last season. ""We showed that we were really a group. We know that in terms of quality, we do not have the best team. But our solidarity, the human relationships, as well as our confidence, have proven to be very important things."" One of the more relieved at the victory was captain Stephane Sessegnon whose tired-looking tackle in the fourth minute of stoppage time handed Morocco a chance to secure a come-from-behind 2-1 win before extra time. The clumsy challenge was such an obvious penalty none of the Benin players disputed the decision but Hakim Ziyech missed the chance","Jul 6, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soccer-benin-pinching-themselves-dream-085519041.html

6,How The Participation of Retail Investors In Equity Markets of India Has Increased in Last 5 Years?,How The Participation Of Retail Investors In Equity Markets Of India Has Increased In Last 5 Years?. Some Major Reasons,"Watch a complete video on our webinar on 'Investing In The Post Covid-19 World. What's Next For Investors?'. Watch Now Few decades back if you had started your career or started earning, equity market in India would probably be your least preferred choice of investment. Most likely it would be centred around traditional investment options like Public Provident Fund, Post-office fixed savings schemes, LIC policies, Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP) or bank fixed deposits. Because that is advice what you would have probably received from your elders.

Traditionally Indians have been averse to saving in the equity market in India and preferred instruments such as gold, real estate and bank deposits. Some of the reasons for this could be attributed to lack of transparency in the equity market in India prior to the commencement of electronic trading when shares were traded in paper and fear on the part of investors due to various scams in 90s such as the Harshad Mehta scam and the Ketan Parekh scam. On one side while stocks of companies like Reliance, Maruti, Eicher Motors, Wipro, Infosys and TCS have created huge wealth for long term investors, the number of investors who made losses by investing in fundamentally weak companies like Suzlon, Reliance Communications, Essar Steel, Kingfisher Airlines, Alok Industries, GTL Infrastructure, Birla Power Solutions etc. is substantially high. According to estimates the percentage of investors who lose wealth in the equity market in India could be as high as 90%. Horror stories of wealth destruction of these investors who lost money in the market have been a big deterrent for new investors.

However things have changed drastically over the last few years, especially during the last 5 years with more and more investors moving towards equity market in India.

According to SEBI data, the number of new demat accounts opened in 2018 touched a 10 year high. The total number of demat accounts rose to from 30.8 lakhs in 2017 to 34.8 lakhs in 2018, which is a 13-percent increase. Demonetization

The Modi government’s decision to demonetize Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes in the year 2016, initiated the process of a changing dynamics of household savings by affecting the savings habits of investors.  Post demonetization there was a fear among people to hoard cash or park their investments in real estate and gold. As a result, there has been a massive shift from investment in physical assets","Jul 5, 2019",https://researchandranking.com/blog/how-the-participation-of-retail-investors-in-equity-markets-of-india-has-increased
7,How a music video changed customer service - Marketplace,"A broken guitar, a YouTube video and a new era of customer service. A broken guitar, a YouTube video and"," The viral revenge song “United Breaks Guitars” turns ten. It was widely reported that within five days of Canadian musician Dave Carroll posting a video for a song called “United Breaks Guitars” on YouTube back in July 2009, United Airlines lost 10% of its market value, costing shareholders roughly $180 million dollars. In truth, it’s probably an exaggeration to claim that dip was caused by Carroll; United’s stock was already on the skids. But with well over 19 million views, a blitz of media coverage and Carroll’s subsequent ascent to an international customer service guru, the video marked a turning point for accountability to customers, globally, and greatly affected United itself –– whether measured in dividends or not. Dave Carroll says it all started in 2008 when he was flying from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Omaha, Nebraska to play a show with his band “Sons of Maxwell.” “When we got to Chicago to deplane and catch our connector, a woman behind our bass player looked out the window and said: ‘Oh my God, they’re [United baggage handlers] throwing guitars outside.’ I asked her what she said again, and she said it the same way and it sounded as bad the second time she said it.” Carroll says he tried to get help from a United customer service agent at O’Hare, but was brushed off. “She stopped her call long enough to say, ‘but hun, that’s why you signed the waiver.'” When Carroll got to Omaha, he opened the case of his $3,500 Taylor guitar he says he scrimped and saved for and found it badly damaged. It had a large hole and the cedar top was coming off. It was late at night and no one was at the service desk, but there was a 1-800 number for complaints. “That was the beginning of a really frustrating customer service maze,” Carroll said. Carroll’s wife worked in customer service at the time and he says he took her advice –– be friendly, but relentless. “For nine months I tried to get the airlines to take some responsibility,” he said. He was bounced around, hung up on and sometimes flat-out ignored. When he did manage to speak to someone, Carroll was given some wild excuses, like being told he would need to go to O’Hare to file his complaint in person. He lived two timezones away.

The mood effect of the weather.","        OPEN ACCESS PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH ARTICLE         This study investigates the relationship between stock returns and local weather through a new channel—the influence of the air-cooling system installed in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). To our knowledge, we are the first to employ the use of air conditioning to examine whether and how weather, especially excessively high temperature, and other factors affect stock returns. Using data for 1885–1914, we show that lower Dow Jones Average (DJA) returns were significantly associated with hotness before the NYSE trading rooms were equipped with the cooling system in 1903, whereas this correlation is largely weakened afterward. We also find that before the introduction of the air-cooling system, the negative effect of high temperatures on stock returns was stronger when the precipitation was lower. We obtain consistent results when controlling for the calendar anomalies such as the May-to-October effect, the Monday effect, and the effect of macroeconomic conditions.

13,Loyalty Program Definition,Loyalty Program. What Is a Loyalty Program?. KEY TAKEAWAYS. How a Loyalty Program Works. . Loyalty Program Examples. Compete Risk,"Loyalty programs encourage shoppers to return to stores where they frequently make purchases. Some of the incentives may include advanced access to new products, additional discounts or sometimes free merchandise. Customers typically register their personal information with the company and are given a unique identifier, such as a numerical ID or membership card, and use that identifier when making a purchase. Loyalty programs provide two key functions: They reward customers for brand loyalty, and they provide the issuing company with a wealth of consumer information. While companies can evaluate anonymous purchases, the use of a loyalty program offers additional details on the type of products that may be purchased together, and whether certain coupons are more effective than others. When rewards programs are integrated into the customer's everyday routine, they can cultivate true brand loyalty. In many ways, companies are doing this by eliminating punch cards for unique mobile experiences that connect a customer to the brand's product or service. Once a customer becomes comfortable with the app, they begin to trust the company will deliver a consistent experience at each time. At this point, customers will stick to a hotel, restaurant, airline, etc., because of points more than anything else. Loyalty programs can provide important spending data from a brand's customers. The Starbucks (SBUX) Rewards program remains the default case study of how a brand can retain customers through interactive offers. The app operates much like any other rewards program, in that customers earn points to use for future coffee purchases. It differentiates itself from other loyalty systems by providing customers a convenient way to order ahead, pay in-store and even access exclusive music playlists. For the most part, the app solidifies Starbucks as a basic necessity for every coffee drinker. Other brands like Costco (COST) and Amazon (AMZN) have achieved greater customer loyalty through annual memberships. Many shoppers happily pay the fees to access the wide variety of products and services offered by the two retailers. And for those who take advantage of all the available services included in a membership, the benefits can often outweigh the costs. This system applies to businesses that thrive on return customers. And since it's more expensive to acquire a new customer than to sell to an existing one, the prospect of creating a loyal following is fundamental to adding value. When appropriately executed, repeat customers will help recruit new ones at","Jul 5, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loyalty-program.asp
