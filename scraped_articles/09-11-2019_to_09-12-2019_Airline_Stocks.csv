2,"As growth stocks fall out of favor, traders say Disney may still surge","As growth falls out of favor, traders say one stock could still surge. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC","Growth stocks are falling out of favor this month. The IVW growth ETF has gained 1% in September, less than a quarter of the rise seen on the IVE value ETF. Some of Wall Street’s favorites this year have also been left out in the cold — Chipotle, Starbucks, PayPal, AMD and Disney have all dipped after leading the market earlier in the year. “You have to be increasingly a little bit more selective. We have seen a little bit of a sign of value shifting more into favor and money moving out of growth in the last week, so it really is dependent on a per-stock basis,” technical analyst Mark Newton of Newton Advisors said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” Newton says Chipotle, PayPal and Starbucks could continue their pullback into September. All have outperformed the broader market this year, with Chipotle’s 85% rise topping the tape. “One I do like is Disney, however. It made a breakout of a four-year chart back a few months ago,” said Newton. “The stock broke out, I believe, in the early part of this year, so that’s been consolidating a bit. I wouldn’t call that weakness as meaningful. If anything, it’s alleviated a lot of its overbought status.”  Disney could get as high as $155, says Newton. That would implies 14% upside and would mark a new high. Mark Tepper, president of Strategic Wealth Partners, agrees that Disney is the standout pick. “When you have a company where you like their thesis like Disney, and suddenly the price becomes more attractive, you need to give it a closer look,” said Tepper. “We own Disney. We continue to believe in them.” He added that the mighty American consumer should continue to carry growth at Disney. “The fundamental growth story for the company hasn’t changed at all. The U.S. consumer is still the strong point of the economy,” Tepper said. “Right now, the biggest catalyst is Disney+, which launches in November, and they’ve just got a huge library of content and it’s world class from Disney to Marvel, Pixar, Lucasfilm. And we all know that it’s all about content.” Disney+ does face headwinds — a crowded streaming field that already includes Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu. Apple just announced pricing details of its own service set to launch Nov. 1. Disclosure: Strategic Wealth Partners holds Disney shares.

4,3 Beaten-Down Industrials Worth Considering Now | The Motley Fool,3 Beaten-Down Industrials Worth Considering Now. These steady and balanced companies could bolster your portfolio.. Looking beyond trade tariffs. Where,"   When scanning the market for value, it's easy to fall prey to lofty dividends and low multiples given by declining and mismanaged businesses. The better move is to find companies that provide a steady balance of responsible management, dividend yields, and growth prospects. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) all have significantly below-market-average valuations and have underperformed the market in 2019, opening the door for value investors to take a look. The biggest of the three, Caterpillar, is known for its farm and construction equipment. Lesser known but making up a good deal of the company's business are diesel and natural gas engines, transmissions, pumps, and generators for the marine and oil and gas industry. Caterpillar's global dealership network covers 21 industries and services six continents. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. FedEx's shipping duopoly with UPS is highly tied to global trade. As such, the stock is hypersensitive to geopolitical news, most notably the recent U.S.-China trade conflict. FedEx employs more than 300,000 people and has seven main business segments: FedEx Corporation, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Services, FedEx Logistics, and FedEx Office. Southwest Airlines got its reputation as the airline with the best customer service in the industry. The company primarily offers flights across the United States as well as to the Caribbean and Mexico. FedEx and Southwest Airlines are both well known for their paradigm-shifting business models, which have since been replicated and adopted into case studies that are taught by Harvard Business School and other universities around the world.

FINANCE. ALL DATA AS OF MARKET CLOSE SEPT. 6, 2019. All three of these companies have exposure to international markets, and they have all been impacted by trade tensions that have been ongoing for more than a year now. But the general health of the American economy affects them too. Unlike consumer staples companies like Procter & Gamble or Clorox that are less reactive to economic cycles. That's because they focus on domestic markets and therefore aren't reliant on trade. Both companies continuously achieve steady growth despite economic cycles thanks to their diversified portfolios of inelasticly demanded products, meaning demand will not fall during a recession. By contrast, most industrial companies depend to","Sep 11, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/09/11/3-beaten-down-industrials-worth-considering-now.aspx
5,Volaris' Turnaround Stays on Track as Summer Air Traffic Soars | The Motley Fool,"Volaris' Turnaround Stays on Track as Summer Air Traffic Soars. The Mexican ultra-low cost airline is benefiting from strong demand,","   After a couple of years of severe earnings pressure, Mexican budget airline Volaris (NYSE:VLRS) began to turn things around about a year ago. While the carrier posted a big loss during the first nine months of 2018 -- and its operating margin deteriorated by more than 6 percentage points year over year -- its operating margin reached 4.5% in the fourth quarter, up from 0.3% in the prior-year period. The turnaround has accelerated this year. Volaris' operating margin improved by more than 10 percentage points in the first half of 2019, reaching 4.4%. Furthermore, all signs point toward continued margin expansion in the back half of the year, with more room for improvement in 2020 and beyond. During Volaris' second-quarter earnings call, management projected that margin expansion would continue in the third quarter, despite somewhat tougher year-over-year comparisons. Strong demand and rising ancillary revenue are driving unit revenue growth, even though fares remain low in many markets. Traffic results for the summer season validate management's bullish outlook. In July, traffic surged 17.2% on a 17.1% increase in capacity, with strong growth in both the domestic and international markets. This caused Volaris' load factor -- the percentage of seats filled with paying customers -- to remain at 88.8%, roughly flat year over year. The carrier's results in August were even more impressive. Traffic surged 19.8% on 15.2% capacity growth. As a result, Volaris' load factor improved by more than 3 percentage points from where it stood in August 2018, reaching 83.4%. VOLARIS POSTED HUGE GAINS IN PASSENGER TRAFFIC THIS SUMMER. IMAGE SOURCE: VOLARIS. Because it is steadily reducing its unit costs, Volaris should be able to drive solid margin expansions even with modest unit revenue growth. In the first half of the year, nonfuel unit costs fell by a little more than 5%. This more than offset an uptick in fuel expense, which was driven by an increase in fuel transfer costs in Mexico. There's a good chance that Volaris will be able to continue cutting its nonfuel unit costs in the third quarter. The strong demand environment has allowed the carrier to maintain aircraft utilization at a high rate, and it's disciplined about managing its costs. Furthermore, fuel cost pressure is likely to abate. Volaris signed new purchase agreements last quarter that will reduce its fuel transfer costs by a third.

9,How to Play a Growth/Value Ratio Reversal,How to Play a Growth/Value Ratio Reversal. Investors rotated out of growth stocks and into value names en masse to,"  Widely recognized investor predicted the top tech stock on the S&P 500
In the last three of four years... See his next prediction here! Sponsored There seemed to be a significant change in the market on Monday, as investors bailed on the growth and momentum names which had outperformed for some time, and flooded into more stable value stocks. Specifically, the S&P 500 Growth Index fell 0.7% on Monday, while the Value Index gained 0.8%. As a CNBC article highlighting Monday’s rotation into value names explained, ""This shift is unnerving to investors because... [a] rotation away from these stocks could result in a downturn for the broader market."" The chart below shows the ratio of the S&P 500 Growth Index to the S&P 500 Value Index. This ratio recently surpassed its highest level ever, which occurred at the peak of the tech boom. The analysis below delves into what this ratio has meant in the past.  The growth/value ratio has been rising throughout the stock market rally since 2009. This has caused some alarm among investors, who seem to think if the ratio reverses, then the market might reverse too. Eyeballing the chart above, I see the ratio decreasing through most of the rally from 2002 through 2007. We have daily data for these two indexes since late 1992 (we have monthly data before that back to 1975). For this study, I looked at how the S&P 500 Index (SPX) has performed going forward based on whether the growth/value ratio was increasing or decreasing. I determined this by whether the ratio was above its 200-day moving average (increasing) or below it (decreasing). Comparing the two tables below, stocks have outperformed when the ratio was increasing -- but not by much. With the ratio increasing, the SPX gained an average of about 5% over the next six months with 74% of the returns positive. When the ratio has been decreasing, the average return is lower, at 3.2%, with 72% of the returns positive. This minor outperformance occurs at every time frame. I find the volatility numbers intriguing. The SPX has tended to make significantly bigger moves when the ratio has been going up compared to going down. When the ratio has been increasing, the index moved by about 10-11% in either direction over six months (looking at the average positive and negative returns), but when it has been decreasing","Sep 11, 2019",https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/analysis/2019/09/11/how-to-play-a-growth-value-ratio-reversal

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Life360, Inc. (ASX:360) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. I will be using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Life360 We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Levered FCF ($, Millions) $-19.2m $-3.7m $5.9m $9.4m $13.4m $17.4m $21.2m $24.6m $27.6m $30.0m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ 59.35% Est @ 42.24% Est @ 30.26% Est @ 21.88% Est @ 16.01% Est @ 11.9% Est @ 9.02% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.74% $-17.6","Sep 11, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/life360-inc-asx-360-investors-044452753.html

Search.,"Air France-KLM reports disappointing summer season Air France-KLM shares dropped the most in six months after the Franco-Dutch carrier said last-minute demand in the crucial summer season has been disappointing. “Close-in bookings in the peak travel period are weaker than foreseen in view of softening macro-economic environment,” the Paris-based airline said in a statement on its August figures Monday. Nevertheless fleet renewal program has been approved recently The shares fell as much as 9.6%, the steepest decline since Feb. 27, after the carrier added seats faster than demand grew, leading to a drop in occupancy levels even as passenger numbers edged higher. The stock traded 8.3% lower at 9:07 euros as of 11:01 a.m. in Paris. The latest numbers suggest any turnaround at Air France-KLM may be fragile amid a bleaker outlook for economic growth in Europe. The carrier published improved second-quarter earnings in July after a string of labor agreements paved the way for expansion of low-cost services. Chief Executive Officer Ben Smith also gave the go-ahead on a long-awaited fleet renewal program. EU market facing cyclical dip Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said in a note that the figures suggest corporate bookings are weakening, since they tend to come closer to the point of travel than leisure sales, providing further evidence that the European market is headed for a cyclical dip.

By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment Even as UK’s clamor to sever ties with the European Union reaches fever pitch, a Hong Kong exchange operator whose main business comes from Mainland China has swooped in to take over a key British institution in a deal that smacks of globalization, a term that does not endear itself well to proponents of Brexit. While announcing the intention by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to acquire the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), the CEO of the former, Charles Li, stated that the proposed transaction would among other things help in internationalizing the world: Together, we will connect East and West, be more diversified and we will be able to offer customers greater innovation, risk management and trading opportunities.   The proposed deal is not at all surprising though in the context of Brexit. More than two years ago there were already calls from Chinese business commentators urging China to ‘prompt’ HKEX into acquiring the London Stock Exchange. One commentator, Peter Guy, argued that amidst the Brexit chaos, a “historical opportunity for China” had emerged to “change the balance of power in global economics and financial markets”.

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) has been in an unstoppable decade-long bull run and it is a few points away from the all-time high of 3,028. However, the impressive uptrend in U.S. stocks is making some investors jittery. A market that is consistently printing fresh highs can be a cause for concern. Many believe that the steep uptrend over the last ten years is no longer sustainable. The popular Elliottician BenjaminBlunts thinks that the S&P 500 has already topped out: BenjaminBlunts is not alone to have this sentiment. Trader Adam Mancini also thinks that the SPX has become bearish. In a tweet, he wrote, Bulls aren’t out of the woods just yet. With the U.S.-China trade war escalating and the U.S. housing and manufacturing indicators flashing signs of weakness, it appears that the current economic climate looks unfavorable to the bulls. However, Alex Kruger, an economist and analyst, thinks that the fear surrounding U.S. equities is unfounded. The widely-followed analyst believes that the SPX is likely to continue humming in the next few years. In technical analysis, the trend is your friend. In other words, if an asset is in an uptrend, it will very likely to continue the trend until it shows clear reversal signals. So far, it appears that Mr. Kruger has yet to see any bearish signals from the S&P 500 Index (SPX). The economist exclusively spoke to CCN.com.

14,Small-cap stocks trading at a discount | Value Research,Stock Ideas      12-Sep-2019. Small-cap stocks trading at a discount. Here are two small cap stocks,"This is a Guest login. Register for free or LOGIN.  The Indian stock market is going through a turbulent ride. Though the Sensex, which is representative of the thirty largest companies in the country in terms of market cap, has corrected by only around one percent in the last one year, the market has experienced a lot of volatility. The real mayhem though was seen in the small cap space with the S&P BSE Small Cap index correcting by more than 20 per cent in the last one year. This correction offers an opportunity to bargain hunters in the small-cap space (with a market cap of between Rs 500-6000 crore). And so we looked at companies that are trading at a substantial discount of at least 30 per cent to their five-year median PE and at the same time have continued to generate a return on their equity of 15 per cent or more in each of the last five years. For further scrutiny, we included only those companies that have had a debt-to-equity of less than one in each of the last five years and which also generate positive cash flow from operations in each of the last five years. Finally, these companies have reported stable operating margins in the last three years. These are our two findings: Accelya Solutions
The company is a software solution provider to the global airline and travel industry. Formerly known as Kale Consultants Ltd, the company was renamed Accelya Kale after the Spain-based Accelya Holdings acquired a controlling stake in 2010. It finally became Accelya Solutions in May 2019. The company's expertise lies in billing, accounting and other ancillary services. It has a strong foothold in the revenue accounting space, and processes two billion transactions per year. Under this segment, it offers its product, Revera under long-term contracts with airline companies. This enables airline companies to have low capex and variable costs, and at the same time provides Accelya with high revenue visibility. The strength of the company lies in having patented technology together with long-term contracts with airline clients. The long-term contracts involve constant data sharing and processing, leading to higher switching costs for airline companies. On the other hand, Accelya faces the risk of technological obsolescence/disruption and so needs to constantly advance technologically. In the near term, the ongoing US-China trade war can affect global air traffic, and hence impact the","Sep 12, 2019",https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stories/47302/small-cap-stocks-trading-at-a-discount
15,"6 ways to invest Dh2,000 in the UAE | Your-money – Gulf News",". . HOW TO. . 6 ways to invest Dh2,000 in the UAE. Invest in stocks. Think exchange-traded funds. Mutual","Got only Dh2,000 to spare? Top financial planners in UAE share tips for investing it wisely Dubai: Saving money remains a top priority among many residents in the UAE, but unfortunately, only a few are able to set aside a huge portion of their income to secure a comfortable retirement or fulfil their financial goals in life. According to a survey by Payfort, an Amazon company, the majority of people living in the UAE (38 per cent) are able to save only 10 per cent of their income, while only less than a quarter (23 per cent) manage to leave 10 to 25 per cent of their earnings untouched. A worrying 28 per cent, nearly three out of ten people, are not saving at all. If the majority of the earners make less than Dh10,000 a month, that means most people barely manage to spare less than Dh1,000—or nothing at all-- every payday. But financial advisers say those who are determined to build their income should not despair, because no matter how small the savings they make each month, be it Dh100, Dh250 or Dh1,000, they can still see their money grow. The key is not to stash that unspent income in a jar or zero-interest bank account. Invest it. In fact, people don’t need to set aside a ton of dirhams to become an investor and it doesn’t require a master’s or PhD to put that small money to work. If, after all this time, you have managed to put away only Dh2,000, here’s what you can do with it. Stocks are one of the most popular investment options for those who don’t belong to the high-net-worth segment. They are quite affordable and you can buy shares from some of your favourite companies for less than Dh100. It is ideal to buy multiple stocks, say, a minimum of five or six, to have a diversified portfolio. It is important to note, however, that when buying stocks, one must enlist the services of a discount broker instead of a full-service professional, which only works with investors who have a lot of money to invest or those who can afford to pay a high minimum deposit and commission. This can be done by opening an account with an online discount brokerage firm. The other option is to buy shares directly from a company, if you want to save on brokers’ fe","Sep 11, 2019",https://gulfnews.com/how-to/your-money/6-ways-to-invest-dh2000-in-the-uae-1.2127866
