0,Forget Warren Buffett! Another Legendary Investor Is Bullish on Airline Stocks - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Forget Warren Buffett! Another Legendary Investor Is Bullish on Airline Stocks. Forget,"      Joey Frenette | July 3, 2020 | More on: AC Warren Buffett shocked the world when he announced that he’d sold out of all the airline stocks that he’d accumulated over the years. Heck, Buffett scooped up a considerable chunk of shares of Delta Airlines, just weeks before he threw in the towel on the ailing industry over coronavirus-related uncertainties. The only thing more un-Buffett-like than selling the airline stocks at a major loss was how quick Warren Buffett was to ditch Delta after his latest (and last) helping to the major U.S. airlines. There’s no question that the airline thesis has changed for the worst this year. The highly profitable firms of yesteryear, such as Air Canada (TSX:AC), suddenly found themselves cutting capacity, raising liquidity, and battening down the hatches in an unprecedented fight for survival. Last year, airlines may have been a sound investment by investors, including the likes of Warren Buffett. But in the age of COVID-19, they’re now seen as more of a dangerous speculation that could end in tears for those who are chasing upside with no consideration for potential downside risks. That’s not to say that you should blindly follow Warren Buffett out of airline stocks like Air Canada, though, especially if you’re a young investor with the stomach for an all-or-nothing bet. For every big-league investor who’s bearish, there’s bound to be one that’s a raging bull. Consider legendary investor (and founder of Miller Value Partners) Bill Miller, whose claim to fame is beating the S&P 500 for 15 consecutive years between 1991 and 2005. The man knows how to beat the market like it’s nobody else’s business. So, when the man speaks, it can pay dividends to listen up, even if what he says goes against the legendary Warren Buffett. Miller is a raging bull when it comes to the airlines, going as far as saying that investors who don’t own them are “making a bet against the [coronavirus] vaccine” in a virtual round table hosted by Ariel Investments. Miller notes that people “love flying” and that once a vaccine lands that the air travel industry will come back “very, very quickly.” While most pundits see a slow and steady multi-year recovery for the airlines, with the odd bankruptcy en route to post-pandemic normalcy, the ultimate trajectory of the ailing air travel industry ultimately depends solely","Jul 3, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/07/03/forget-warren-buffett-another-legendary-investor-is-bullish-on-airline-stocks/

4,3 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in July | The Motley Fool,3 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in July. Large companies with great balance sheets are looking good right now. Here are,"   While the COVID-19 pandemic has put many smaller companies in danger of going out of business, large companies with rock-solid balance sheets are looking good these days. In difficult times, big companies with lots of cash can take advantage by investing through a downcycle to take market share, buy back their own stock, or make bargain acquisitions. In the best of all worlds, they do all three. In that light, here are three large-cap stocks that, even after the market's historic run since March, still look like bargain buys today. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was looking to be a solid year for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Obviously, things changed with the pandemic outbreak, as many businesses, especially those in travel and leisure, greatly reduced their advertising spend in Alphabet's Google properties. In fact, research firm eMarketer predicts Google's ad revenue will decline about 5% in 2020 -- the first time in Google's history it will experience an ad-revenue decline. That dour outlook may be why Alphabet is the only FAANG stock that currently sits below its February high. However, that could spell opportunity. While Alphabet's ad revenue may decrease this year, its cloud infrastructure business is booming, up 52.2% in the first quarter. Video-conferencing app Google Meet also saw a 30-fold increase in usage in Q1, and Chromebook laptop sales boomed in March as work-from-home and remote education took hold in the wake of the pandemic. While Alphabet's overall ad revenue declined to exit the quarter, YouTube actually remained resilient, exiting Q1 at a 9% growth rate. Meanwhile, YouTube premium subscriptions grew as people looked to digital subscriptions to pass the time at home. So at least part of Alphabet's empire is quite resistant to the coronavirus, even if ad revenue suffers in the near term. Thus, Alphabet is simultaneously both a stay-at-home play and a recovery play. On top of that, investors have several lottery tickets in the form of Alphabet's ""other bets,"" which include self-driving car company Waymo, along with many other futuristic technologies. Finally, Alphabet has the cash not only to buy back its own stock, which it did in record amounts last quarter as the share price fell, but also to make acquisitions. Last week, Alphabet bought smart-glasses maker North, which should bolster Alphabet's efforts in augmented reality and ambient computing. All in all, Alphabet's financial strength and","Jul 4, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/04/3-large-cap-stocks-to-buy-in-july.aspx

6,"Delta, American and United: The future of air travel",Air travel in six months: What it will look like. MORE IN AT WORK. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"Summer vacations used to mean wine tasting in Tuscany, backpacking in Southeast Asia or trips to the Grand Canyon. But fears that airplanes could be a breeding ground for Covid-19 infections have wreaked havoc on the air travel industry. “This could take several years before we’re into our new normal of traveling,” said Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian. Last Sunday, fewer than 640,000 passengers flew out of U.S. airports compared with more than 2.6 million travelers a year earlier. With passenger demand in sharp decline, Delta, United and American parked hundreds of planes and posted their first quarterly losses in more than five years.  American Airlines said it expects its second quarter 2020 revenue to be down about 90% versus the second quarter of 2019.  The U.S. airline industry is in turmoil. ″This is the biggest crisis of all, bigger even than 9/11, than SARS and the Great Recession and all of that. Every crisis changes the airline industry, so it’s only reasonable to think that the biggest crisis of all will cause some of the biggest changes of all,” said Seth Kaplan, aviation analyst and principal with Kaplan Research.  To lure panicked travelers back, U.S. carriers have implemented new rules, deep-cleaned planes and waived some fees. Some airlines are also limiting the number of seats they sell. But analysts argue that even with all the changes, it’s impossible to maintain social distancing rules on airplanes. U.S. airlines are facing their biggest crisis in a generation and the stakes have never been higher. So will all these changes keep passengers safe? And what can travelers expect in six months?

While Postmedia may collect a commission on sales through the links on this page, we are not being paid by the brands mentioned. When U.S. investing legend Warren Buffett speaks, millions pay attention. The folksy financial guru who eats at McDonald’s and still lives in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, is a billionaire many, many times over. Buffett buffs watch him closely to pick up tips on how they can get wealthy, too. Ears have pricked up in recent weeks, as Buffett has shared some money wisdom about the coronavirus pandemic. Wall Street is having fits over reports of fresh outbreaks in multiple states. See what the “Oracle of Omaha” has to say about the crisis and stock investing, credit card debt and more. Buffett became one of the wealthiest people on the planet by capitalizing on opportunities. He sees some fantastic opportunities right now, courtesy of central banks. “This is a very good time to borrow money, which means it may not be such a great time to lend money, but it’s good … that it’s a good time to borrow money,” he said in May at an online shareholders meeting for his company, Berkshire Hathaway. To help the economy recover from the coronavirus, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. “did the right thing” by cutting a key interest rate to near zero, Buffett said. The Bank of Canada did the same here, and now, for homebuyers and homeowners, it’s an excellent time to borrow. Rates on new and refinance mortgages are the lowest on record. It’s even possible to find five-year loans with rates under 2%, if you shop around and compare mortgage offers from several lenders. They don’t call him an oracle for nothing. The multi-billionaire said during an interview in March: “I’ve always felt a pandemic would happen sometime.” Last year, he warned that the world was due for a “megacatastrophe.” Buffett told his shareholders in a letter that it would be some kind of “total surprise” that would dwarf devastating hurricanes Katrina and Michael. He said Berkshire, which is big in the insurance business (it owns Geico and other insurers) would suffer massive losses — but would be ready for business the next day.

8,Qantas share price: Where next? | IG AU,Where next for Qantas shares?. An industry in chaos. Seize a share opportunity today. The Coronavirus & Qantas relationship in," We examine some of the key developments from the airline over the last few months as well as look at where four of Australia’s top investment banks think the stock will head next. On a global scale – the coronavirus pandemic has potentially impacted the aviation industry the most significantly – with many governments locking down their borders and restricting travel on a domestic-level. Adding to this, oil price volatility and a generally weak economic outlook have not helped matters. Qantas Airways (QAN) – Australia’s flagship carrier – has been particularly impacted, drastically slashing their domestic and international capacity in response to the still-unfolding coronavirus pandemic. The secondary consequence has been a broad-based collapse in the share prices of global airlines, with many US and European airlines seeing their stock precipitously decline since late-February. Australia’s second domestic airline Virgin Australia, even fell into voluntary administration, though was subsequently bought by US-based private equity giant Bain Capital. Go long or short on thousands of international stocks. In response to the emerging coronavirus pandemic, on 10 March Qantas informed the market that it would be further reducing its international and domestic capacity by 23% and 5%, respectively; cancelling its previously planned off market share buy-back program; though it told investors at the time it was still committed to paying an interim dividend of 13.5 cents per share. The Group's CEO, Alan Joyce, even said he would take no salary during FY20. Things deteriorated at a rapid click however, as coronavirus cases across the globe continued to spread at an accelerated rate during March. Just a week later, on 17 March, Qantas released an additional coronavirus update to the market, revealing it would be slashing international capacity by 90% and domestic capacity by 60% – with the cuts set to last from the end of May to the middle of September. Just two days later Qantas made yet another coronavirus-related update. The headline revelation here was that the majority of the airline’s workforce would be stood down until at least the end of May. The dividend, previously announced was also pushed back to September – though would eventually be cancelled completely. 'No airline in the world is immune to this' Alan Joyce said in a statement to the ASX at the time, while reassuring investors that 'Our balance sheet means we've entered this crisis in better shape than most and we're taking","Jul 3, 2020",https://www.ig.com/au/news-and-trade-ideas/where-next-for-qantas-shares--200703

How Mastercard’s CEO is working toward financial inclusion,"Subscribe to our Newsletter    Subscribe to How To Reopen, our weekly newsletter on what it takes to reboot business in the midst of a pandemic.

American Airlines’ stock is flying higher as investors look to signs that the economy is beginning to recover—and flight demand with it.

The airline stock surged Thursday, then again led the S&P 500 higher on Friday morning, trading up roughly 15% for a two day gain of over 60% by midday. Fellow airlines United Airlines and Delta Airlines were also up over 13% and 8% respectively by midday.

The boost in airline stocks comes as states begin to reopen and restrictions start loosening. That’s led several companies including American Airlines to announce they are boosting flight capacity in the coming months. American Airlines said Thursday it plans to fly 55% of its domestic schedule and 20% of its international schedule in July—a massive boost from last month, when it only flew 20% of its schedule from the previous year in May.

“We’re seeing a slow but steady rise in domestic demand. After a careful review of the data, we’ve built a July schedule to match,” Vasu Raja, senior vice president of network strategy at American Airlines, said in a press release. The announcement pushed the airline’s stock up over 40% on Thursday—it’s best one-day boost ever. In fact, those trends in increasing load size are what Burkett Huey, an aerospace analyst at Morningstar, call “the most encouraging sign.” Yet he sees it “more as limiting 2020 losses—that’s the positive news,” he told Fortune. According to Huey, American’s stock is higher on Friday due to “the recent load factor trends, which are indicating that people are getting more comfortable flying than they were just two months ago.” Flights have been modestly increasing in recent weeks, with nearly 400,000 passengers passing through TSA checkpoints on Thursday, according to TSA daily data (still a yawning gulf from its year-ago period, which saw over 2.6 million). Meanwhile, US Global Jets, an airline exchange-traded fund with the ticker JETS, has seen a massive surge in assets in recent months, boosting its inflows from $33 million in March to over $1 billion, helped in part by its recent popularity on trading platform Robinhood. But the recent optimism comes off a period of heavy battering for the industry amid world-wide shutdowns due to the coronavirus, which had seen many big airlines, including American,","Jul 4, 2020",https://thebrokertimes.com/2020/07/04/american-airlines-stock-adds-to-yesterdays-41-gain-as-reopening-optimism-soars/
