0,Spirit Airlines Stock Is Now Cheaper Than Ever | The Motley Fool,Spirit Airlines Stock Is Now Cheaper Than Ever. Trade war fears have pushed Spirit Airlines stock down to a new,"   Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) plummeted 24% on the day after the fast-growing budget carrier reported its second-quarter results in late July. As I described at the time, this was an overreaction to the company's poor Q3 guidance. While Spirit's profit margin is set to contract this quarter, most of the damage can be traced to short-term cost headwinds and easily addressed tactical missteps. In the roughly two weeks since the earnings report, Spirit Airlines stock has fallen even further, as part of a broader market sell-off sparked primarily by trade war fears. This has made the stock even more attractive for long-term investors.  SPIRIT AIRLINES STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. In the eight years that it has been a public company, Spirit Airlines has developed a solid track record for cost control, despite occasional slip-ups. In 2011 -- the year of its initial public offering (IPO) -- Spirit's adjusted nonfuel unit costs came in at 5.72 cents. By 2018, adjusted nonfuel unit costs had fallen to 5.3 cents. Most other airlines reported big unit cost increases over that time period. Nevertheless, unit cost growth is the main problem plaguing Spirit Airlines right now. The carrier expects nonfuel unit costs to surge 7% to 8% year over year in the third quarter, whereas it had initially projected a tame 1% to 2% increase for this quarter. This spike in unit costs is being driven by two main factors. First, Spirit Airlines has incurred additional costs to minimize the impact to customers of runway construction in Fort Lauderdale (the carrier's biggest hub). Second, the implementation of an aggressive schedule designed to boost aircraft utilization during peak periods has caused a sharp increase in weather-related flight cancellations this year, driving up unit costs in various ways. SPIRIT AIRLINES IS FACING AN UNUSUAL JUMP IN UNIT COSTS THIS QUARTER. IMAGE SOURCE: SPIRIT AIRLINES. On the bright side for shareholders, the Fort Lauderdale runway construction is a one-time issue, and Spirit Airlines won't make the same mistake about aircraft scheduling again. As a result, Spirit should be able to gradually widen its unit cost advantage relative to peers in 2020 and beyond -- just as it has in the past. There's no reason to fear that soaring costs will crimp the company's margins in the years ahead.

1,Five of the Most Luxurious Commercial Airlines,Five of the Most Luxurious Commercial Airlines. . Virgin Atlantic. Qatar Airways. Emirates. Singapore Airlines. Etihad Airways. The Bottom Line.,"Whether you just won the lottery, saved up, or are simply looking for a better way to fly, these are the commercial airlines to book for the ultimate in commercial flight luxury. Certain perks exist for those who spend a bit more. Certain things like legroom and in-flight amenities are quantifiable, but many things like staff training and air quality are not so easily measured, but become immediately apparent on these five luxury commercial airlines. Perhaps the tightest luxury seats, Virgin Atlantic’s upper class offers a fold-out bed/seat combo and half-partition walls. Guests can enjoy private chauffeured cars that drop them off at the airport and a private security area at London Heathrow. Richard Branson's airline company has a standing reputation for treating their employees well, and many flyers—and workers alike—report excellent treatment from the British airline. From designer pajamas to celebrity-chef food, no detail is overlooked for Qatar’s first-class passengers. The airline offers the standard seat that folds into a bed along with in-flight cell phone service, a bar, privacy wall and room for a friend to join you in your “cabin.” Wooden trim and purple tones make first-class seem all the more luxurious. Flying with Qatar feels like having your own private booth. Emirates is the first on this list to offer first-class travelers a real private cabin on the flight. This cabin has a mini-bar (in case you didn’t want to get up to visit the common bar), a seat that turns into a bed and food presented on fine china. The first-class bathroom has a shower and, like Virgin Atlantic, travelers can arrive at the airport in style in a private chauffeur-driven car. Emirates is consistently one of the most expensive first-class options, but the details make the flight not only enjoyable, but an absolute pleasure. Singapore Airline suites allow for complete privacy in an enclosed cabin. For traveling couples, the privacy wall can be retracted and the two seats folded out into a double bed. Travelers are treated to private check-in and luxury lounge services as well as on-demand meals and beverages. While the bathrooms leave much to be desired when compared to Emirates’, a ticket is also significantly less. Ever wanted to travel in a cabin bigger than your apartment? No, Etihad doesn’t offer private flights, but the airline does have the next best thing: The Residence, a three-room suite with a permanent double","Aug 11, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/102115/five-most-luxurious-airlines.asp
2,Boeing investors can look to Chipotle as path back to stock returns,Why Boeing investors can look to Chipotle as a path through crisis and back to big stock returns. The Boeing,"Boeing investors face more questions than answers as its 737 Max crisis drags on, but the company could find a way forward by turning to an unlikely example: Chipotle Mexican Grill. Chipotle shares were on an incredible run from the company’s IPO to mid-2015, climbing more than 1,400%, but in July of that year an E. coli outbreak sickened hundreds of customers. Sales plunged and then came more E. coli outbreaks, plus norovirus and salmonella outbreaks, that further deteriorated public confidence. It took more than three years before Chipotle’s stock stopped falling — even after the company eventually quelled safety concerns. At the bottom, its shares lost about two-thirds of their value. Boeing is playing out a similar story. Over a decade, its shares rose more than 700%. It was one of the best-performing stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But Boeing’s climb stopped when tragedy struck, twice: Just several months apart, two Boeing 737 Max airplanes crashed, killing a total of 346 people. Federal regulators grounded the 737 Max – there were 387 in service around the world. Boeing slowed production of the jets and continues working with regulators to find a fix for the aircraft’s software, which has been implicated in the crashes. Its stock has lost about a quarter of its value since its most recent high. “Airplanes are not lettuce,” Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein told CNBC. Indeed, at a glance these two companies are vastly different, yet a comparison of their crises reveals noted similarities that should give Boeing investors a better sense of how long the recovery process may take. “From the point of view that lettuce is a core piece of what Chipotle does, the 737 is a core piece of what Boeing does – about a third of their cash flow,” Epstein said. Both crises show how perception of management’s competency, as well as rebuilding customer confidence, is key to a successful recovery. “It’s amazing that we’re talking about two very different companies and two very different situations, but I do think that at the root of it is this: If management comes across as complacent, it can have a more serious ripple effect than in any time in history,” Morningstar consumer analyst R.J. Hottovy told CNBC. “You can’t come across as if it’s no big deal because, in this day and age of social media, those are the type","Aug 11, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/11/boeing-investors-can-look-to-chipotle-as-path-back-to-stock-returns.html

VOLATILITY.," Don’t get me wrong; I don’t have anything against any of the employees of Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B), its shareholders, or its senior management. In fact, for those who were fortunate enough to buy a stake in Canada’s largest airline at the start of the decade, it’s been one heck of a wild ride, with AC shares up an incredible 3,194% since the beginning of 2010. But all those niceties aside, here’s why if I were going to short-sell one stock on the TSX Index this year, Air Canada would be it. Granted, this is a development that is completely beyond AC’s control, and there’s absolutely nothing that management could have done to prevent it. But the continued grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX fleet, Air Canada says, will continue to hamper it even heading into 2020, announcing last week it plans to scrub the aircraft from all scheduled dates until the second week of January. Despite that the airline is now calling for a 5% boost to its earnings in the third quarter, readers will want to note that expected increase is tied to its own expectations for “adjusted core earnings” rather than the GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings that publicly traded companies are officially evaluated on. It doesn’t help either that we’re now entering what is traditionally the busiest travel season for Canadians in the third quarter, which will only serve to increase the demands already being placed on AC’s staff to re-route travelers and employ the use of leased aircraft from rival carriers. Nor does it help that markets have been “choppy,” to say the least, so far in August. Airlines and leisure and business travel in general have notoriously been sensitive to changes in investor confidence, as these big-ticket expenses can, in most cases, be deferred to a later date or even eliminated altogether. If ongoing trade tensions, tariffs, or the possibility of an abrupt Brexit were to send the economy into a recessionary malaise, airlines like Air Canada could stand to bear the brunt of that impact.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   The Sentry Mode on Tesla cars has been helpful for catching thieves, but one security researcher wants to illustrate the advantages and pitfalls of taking that camera system to its logical conclusion. Tevora's Truman Kain has developed a Surveillance Detection Scout mod that effectively turns a Model 3 or Model S into a rolling observation deck. The project plugs an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier computer into a USB port and uses open source machine learning to detect both faces and license plates. It sends a phone notification if it repeatedly spots the same plate or person, giving you a warning that someone may be tailing you or preparing to steal your car. The Scout's alerts (sent through IFTTT) are delayed by about a minute due to the time it takes to record video, and you currently have to create your own web server for this to work in the first place. However, it's also using off-the-shelf hardware and code that doesn't require tearing your car open. In theory, anyone who's reasonably tech-savvy could use this. Whether or not they do is another matter. It could help thwart thieves, stalkers and vandals, but there's also the risk of flagging innocent people who just happen to share the same drive or are curious about the car. In some states, such as Georgia and New Hampshire, it might also be deemed illegal as an automatic license plate reader. There are also privacy implications. It wouldn't take much to modify the code to create a network of cars that could track people across wide areas, and even a single car might contain a wealth of sensitive data. In many ways, the Scout makes a case for limiting access to car cameras -- there's conspicuous room for abuse. Sometimes, following a leader makes the best investment strategy. And corporate insiders have long been popular leaders to follow. Their combination of responsibility to their stockholders and access to ‘under the hood’ information on their companies gives their personal investment choices an air of authority.The most important thing about these insiders is that whatever else they do,","Aug 10, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2019-08-10-tesla-surveillance-detection-scout-mod.html
6,"Why Vistara went international: Scrapping 5/20 rule, Jet Airways grounding were major boost - The Financial Express","Why Vistara went international: Scrapping 5/20 rule, Jet Airways grounding were major boost. Amid Jet Airways grounding and Air India’s","Earlier this week, Tata- Singapore Airlines’ joint venture Vistara launched its international operations with maiden flights to Singapore from Delhi and Mumbai. Amid Jet Airways grounding and Air India’s mounting debt pile, the time is ripe for other carriers to fill the void in the domestic and international aviation market. However, Vistara’s move also comes in the light of revocation of the 5/20 rule for international flights, making it the first beneficiary of the rule.  According to the 5/20 rule (now-scrapped), Indian carriers were required to complete at least five years in domestic operations and also have at least 20 aircraft in the fleet before the airline is permitted to fly on international routes. However, the same was revoked in 2016 and as per the updated civil aviation policy, the five-year clause of the rule no longer stands. Had the rule been effective now, Vistara, which was launched in 2015, would have had to wait until 2020 to fly internationally. Under the new norm, carriers only need 20 aircraft deployed on domestic operations to be able to fly internationally. Meanwhile, talks of divesting another international airline — Air India —  are also rife.  However, Vistara is not the only domestic airline which will serve in the Singapore market. Several other airlines such as IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir, in addition to global premium carriers such as Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, etc also have a presence in the Asian country.  Vistara is also expected to expand further and is likely to announce services to Colombo and Kathmandu. Bangkok and Dubai are also on the cards, Vistara announced. The airline looks to deploy its narrow-body fleet that comprises Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737 aircraft. Vistara is also expecting deliveries of Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft due by next year. This will enable the premium airline to operate on long-haul routes such as destinations in Europe, Australia, etc.  Subscribe to Financial Express' weekly SME newsletter for latest and all-round coverage from the world of the biggest business in India - the Micro, Small and Medium Business.

Site Information Navigation","ADVERTISEMENT  The airline agreed to bar employees who support or join protests from working on flights to mainland China, though it didn’t say how they would be identified. By Raymond Zhong and Tiffany May HONG KONG — Two months of boiling antigovernment protests have divided Hong Kong’s people. Now, the unrest has pitted one of the territory’s best-known international brands against some of its own employees. The Chinese government has forced Cathay Pacific Airways, a longtime emblem of Hong Kong’s proud status as a global capital, to bar staffers who support or participate in the territory’s protests from doing any work involving flights to mainland China. As part of the same demands, issued on Friday, it ordered that the airline begin submitting information about all crew members flying to — or above — the mainland to the Chinese authorities for prior approval. Cathay said separately on Saturday that it had removed from flying duties a pilot who was charged with rioting in Hong Kong, and that it had fired two airport ground staff for misconduct. Earlier in the week, the airline said it would investigate accusations that its employees had leaked travel information for a Hong Kong police soccer team. [More than 150 flights at Hong Kong’s airport were canceled on Monday as protesters flooded the main terminal.] ADVERTISEMENT The orders from mainland air safety officials represent an escalation into Hong Kong’s business affairs, illustrating the power Beijing wields over international companies that build their fortunes on access to China. Some in the semiautonomous territory fear that China’s political encroachment also represents an economic threat, not only to Cathay, but also to all multinational companies in Hong Kong. “If you’re a boss, you’re thinking, ‘Oh my God!’” said Carol Ng of the Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, a union that represents airline workers. “‘I just want to do business here. Now they’re screening my staff.’” This kind of fear could do real damage to Hong Kong’s economy, Ms. Ng said, “much more than the protests or rallies themselves.” Cathay representatives did not respond on Sunday when asked how exactly the company planned to enforce the new orders from Beijing. China’s aviation regulator was not available for comment. The airline’s largest shareholder is Swire Pacific, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate with British roots. Its second largest owner is Air China, the state-run carrier.

Thai Airways Q2 loss more than doubles as revenue drops. . . . . .," [BANGKOK] Thai Airways International's second-quarter loss more than doubled as the global economic slowdown, fierce competition and a strengthened Thai baht took their toll on revenue. The company reported a 6.88 billion baht (S$309.8 million) loss in the second quarter, compared with a 3.1 billion baht deficit a year earlier, according to a filing to Thai exchange late Friday. Revenue fell 10 per cent to 42.5 billion baht.

13,"Final evasion: For 30 years, prosecutors and victims tried to hold Jeffrey Epstein to account. At every turn, he slipped away. - The Washington Post","Final evasion: For 30 years, prosecutors and victims tried to hold Jeffrey Epstein to account. At every turn, he slipped","At the beginning, middle and end of his career, Jeffrey Epstein faced a reckoning with his misdeeds. At every stage, he managed to avoid the efforts of prosecutors and victims to confront him with his financial chicanery and sexual abuses. On Saturday, he apparently chose to end his life rather than face what he had done. Epstein’s death by hanging in his cell in a New York jail appears to be a macabre final escape in a long series of evasions by a fabulously wealthy financier and convicted sex offender who used his private jet and Palm Beach parties to lure presidents and plutocrats into his orbit. Equal parts charismatic and devious, he was a Wall Street washout with a knack for numbers and, according to those who worked with him, a mind set on deceit. From his beginnings as a college dropout who scored a job as a math teacher at a Manhattan prep school to his career as a millionaire adviser to some of the nation’s top corporate executives and politicians, Epstein acted as if the rules of life did not apply to him. A decade ago, he avoided a long prison sentence even after police and prosecutors amassed an enormous array of evidence showing that he regularly abused girls at his Palm Beach mansion and on a Caribbean island that he’d bought. In that case, as at several pivotal points throughout his life, Epstein avoided the law by deploying some of the nation’s most famous lawyers and leaning on friendships with powerful figures in politics, business and academia. Epstein’s ability to slip away even when those around him are held to account reaches back to well before he’d accumulated any fortune. Epstein, who died at 66, reported to federal authorities recently that he was worth $559 million, but some of his associates contend he had much more than that hidden overseas; others wonder whether he had anything close to that sum. Whatever the truth, he worked to build the impression that he was wealthy and influential, helping him connect with powerful people who for many years defended his character when rumors emerged that he was abusing women and girls. ‘She was shaking’: Court filings describe system Jeffrey Epstein allegedly used to procure girls The story of Epstein’s first great escape is a tale of financial wizardry and brazen criminality, in which hundreds of thousands of Americans lost","Aug 10, 2019",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/final-evasion-for-30-years-prosecutors-and-victims-tried-to-hold-jeffrey-epstein-to-account-at-every-turn-he-slipped-away/2019/08/10/30bc947a-bb8a-11e9-a091-6a96e67d9cce_story.html
