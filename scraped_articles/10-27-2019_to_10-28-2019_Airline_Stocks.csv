New Ways","JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU) shares rose more than 2% during Monday's session after JPMorgan upgraded the stock from Neutral to Overweight and assigned a price target of $24 per share, representing a 25% premium to current price levels. Analyst Jamie Baker simultaneously downgraded Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $76 per share. Baker notes that Alaska Airlines' valuation has soared to the second highest level in his coverage, while JetBlue trades with the lowest target price-to-earnings multiple in the group, implying attractive upside potential. He projects that JetBlue will hit $2.50 in earnings per share next year. The analyst upgrade comes shortly after the airline's strong third quarter financial results. Revenue rose 4% to $2.09 billion, in line with analyst estimates, while GAAP earnings came in at 63 cents per share, beating consensus estimates by 10 cents per share. Management sees full-year capacity increasing 6% to 7% percent versus a prior projected rise of just 5.5% to 6.5%. From a technical standpoint, the stock broke out from its prior highs last week following its earnings breakout toward trendline resistance near $19.75 per share. The relative strength index (RSI) moved back into overbought territory with a reading of 70.57, while the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) extended its bullish crossover. These indicators suggest that the stock could see some consolidation before a move up. Traders should watch for some consolidation below trendline resistance at $19.75 before a breakout higher. In particular, traders could see a range between $18.50 and $19.75 over the coming sessions. If the stock breaks out from trendline resistance, traders could see a move toward fresh 52-week highs. If the stock breaks down from support, traders could see a move toward reaction lows of about $16.00.

AAL has made a nice turnaround, and now's time to consider buying shares,","In his ""Mad Money"" show Friday night, Jim Cramer welcomed back Doug Parker, chairman and CEO of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) , which just posted a mixed quarter, but still saw its shares rise 4.9% by the close Friday. Parker explained that American has invested $31 billion to upgrade and modernize its fleet, and that it now has the youngest fleet in the business. Those investment costs will be dropping off quickly, he noted, which will be a big boost to cash flows. When asked about the competitive environment, Parker said the airline business is always competitive. Consumer demand remains strong, he said. Finally, Parker spoke about Boeing's (BA) 737 Max. He said Boeing failed to deliver on their promises and the $540 million loss American has suffered should not be paid by American's shareholders. When asked about the plans to return the aircraft to service, Parker said American's pilots are heavily involved with both Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, and when American Airlines' pilots say the plane is safe, it will be safe. Let's check and see if the charts are safe for purchase. In this daily bar chart of AAL, below, we can see that prices and the indicators have improved significantly this month. Prices are trading above the now rising 50-day moving average line and above the still declining 200-day line. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line moved above its September peak to make a higher high and start an uptrend. A rising OBV line tells us that buyers are more aggressive, which is different than the declining pattern we have seen since November. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator just moved above the zero-line for an outright go-long signal.  In this weekly bar chart of AAL, below, we can see that prices have been in a decline from early 2018. We can now see a small double-bottom around $25, and that prices are testing the underside of the bottoming 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line shows a similar double-bottom, and the weekly MACD oscillator crossed to the upside from below the zero-line for a cover shorts buy signal.  In this Point and Figure chart of AAL, below, we can see that an upside price target of $36 is projected.

The Google parent fell more than 2% after the bell Monday after posting $10.12 in profit for the third quarter, $2.34 less than expected. However, the third FANG name to report remains the best performer this month, rising more than 6% and besting gains in Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. “I actually used that strength … to add to my portfolio last week,” Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Monday before the release. “We’ve just been bumping up against this $1300 region and the rest of the FANGs have not.

5,Thank these five stocks as S&P 500 reaches new record - BNN Bloomberg,. BNN. OPINION. OPINION. Investing. News Wire. Thank these five stocks as S&P 500 reaches new record. . Opinion. ,"    Oct 28, 2019  Robert Burgess, Bloomberg News (Bloomberg Opinion) -- If someone woke from a coma and saw that the S&P 500 Index was up 21 per cent for the year and reaching a new record high on Monday, the immediate reaction would most likely be that everything is great. But that’s far from true. The list of reasons stocks should be down is much longer than the one for why they should be up. The economy has slowed, and a majority of chief financial officers anticipate a recession within a year. Earnings have stopped growing, and estimates are being cut. Stock valuations are high. The U.S.-China trade war has not been resolved. Congress has started an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy, but that’s only because the outlook has deteriorated. So why are equities roaring ahead? The answer comes down to a handful of stocks: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Oracle Corp. Those five companies account for half of the S&P 500 tech sector, which has surged 30.2 per cent for the year. Exclude that sector and the S&P 500 would be up only about 14 per cent, according to DataTrek Research. That’s still good but nothing special when compared with the returns in the rest of the world, with the MSCI All-Country World Index excluding the U.S. having gained 12 per cent. Therein lies the hidden risk embedded in the market, which is that any missteps by any of these highfliers could spell doom for equities more broadly. It also underscores just how lacking in breadth this latest leg up has been. For one, the percentage of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange closing above their 200-day moving averages has dropped to 53 per cent from 59 per cent in mid-September. Not only that, but the spread between the share of S&P 500 members closing at 52-week highs and the share at 52-week lows has been in a general downtrend since June. To be sure, it’s not unusual that a handful of stocks have led the broader market higher. Before this year, it was the FAANG group of stocks: Facebook Inc., Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and a few others.

6,Avianca Holdings S.A. (AVH) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock? | Nasdaq,Avianca Holdings S.A. (AVH) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?. TRENDING TOPICS. TRENDING ARTICLES. OTHER TOPICS.,"A
vianca Holdings S.A. (AVH) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Avianca Holdings S.A. basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. For Avianca Holdings S.A. rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks","Oct 28, 2019",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/avianca-holdings-s.a.-avh-upgraded-to-buy%3A-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-2019-10-28

PaulSh. .," I always think it best to understand what the enemy are thinking – and understand when they’ve got a point. I don’t think it unreasonable to say that if you are a private investor you might assume that most Marxists can be regarded as the enemy. Their view of capitalism is necessarily negative, and they tend to assume that the financialisation of most assets, allowing their stocks and bonds to be traded, is a very bad thing that needs to be stopped. Just in case you think I’m being judgemental one could point at the returns from investing in stocks in Marxist or socialist countries, which are, to put it mildly, pretty terrible. But modern communists have cottoned on to something terrifically important – the rise of abundance and the race to zero. A growing number of communist thinkers reckon that capitalism may be working towards its own extinction by turning once expensive things into freely available, abundant resources. This thinking was kick-started in the world of the internet where the price of many valuable things is already close to or next to zero. Their core argument is that innovation and competition is pushing the marginal cost of producing many public goods inexorably down and that this is a good thing that can be expanded into areas. Maybe one should add investing to this list! I jest not. Perhaps the most fascinating development of the last few years has been the race to zero involving fund management fees and broking charges. As competition has intensified, fees have collapsed and we are now approaching what I think could be a crucial turning point. Early in October the US broking giant Charles Schwab announced that it was reducing its broking charges to zero.  Sadly, we’re still a long way from this communist fee-free nirvana for broking fees in the UK but I smell change in the wind. Freetrade is already offering, guess what, free share trades and another fintech unicorn Revolut has also started offering fee-free access to a limited number of US shares. In the next few weeks we’ll also see a new service launched by Australian outfit Stake which will offer fee-free, full access to US shares without any restrictions.

8,Spirit Airlines Sticks With the Airbus A320neo for Growth | The Motley Fool,"Spirit Airlines Sticks With the Airbus A320neo for Growth. After flirting with several other aircraft types, the budget carrier decided","   More than three years ago, Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) began planning for its next major aircraft order. Notably, the company -- which for many years has only operated Airbus (OTC:EADSY) A320-family aircraft -- strongly considered adding a smaller aircraft type to its fleet: either the Airbus A220, formerly known as the Bombardier CSeries, or the Embraer E2-series jets. It even evaluated adding the Boeing 737 MAX to its fleet mix. In the end, all of the drama was for nothing. Last week, Spirit Airlines and Airbus announced that the carrier had signed a memorandum of understanding to buy 100 A320neo family jets, maintaining its strategy of operating a single fleet type. Currently, Spirit Airlines' order book only runs through 2021. It calls for the carrier to end that year with 193 planes in its fleet: 31 A319s, 64 A320s, 68 A320neos, and 30 A321s. This is significant because Airbus ended last month with more than 5,700 firm orders for A320-family jets in its backlog. It is building fewer than 700 per year and has limited flexibility to increase production in the near future. As a result, Airbus is mostly sold out of delivery slots until 2024. Meanwhile, to maintain its planned double-digit capacity growth rate, Spirit Airlines will need dozens of aircraft deliveries each year. SPIRIT AIRLINES PLANS TO ORDER AT LEAST 100 AIRBUS A320NEO-FAMILY JETS. IMAGE SOURCE: AIRBUS. Airbus does reserve some delivery slots for important customers, and it's generally possible to line up aircraft from leasing companies with only a year or two of notice. Nevertheless, given the scale of Spirit's likely aircraft purchase needs, the airline has been running out of time to make a decision. According to the agreement announced on Wednesday, Spirit Airlines will place a firm order for 100 A320neo-family jets. It plans to take a mix of A319neos, A320neos, and A321neos, with deliveries between 2022 and 2027. The airline will also have options for another 50 aircraft. Spirit will have substitution rights between the three models, so it can choose which specific models to receive based on demand and other business considerations. It also has the right to switch some orders to the smaller A220 family, but CFO Scott Haralson told investors during the company's Q3 earnings call on Thursday morning that the carrier has no intention of doing so. Haralson also acknowledged that this 100-aircraft order doesn't cover Spirit's full","Oct 27, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/27/spirit-airlines-sticks-with-the-airbus-a320neo-for.aspx

Just Recorded A 13% EPS Beat: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Next. The Bottom Line. Discounted cash,"It's been a good week for Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest third-quarter results, and the shares gained 6.1% to US$56.74. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$5.6b were in line with what analysts predicted, Southwest Airlines surprised by delivering a profit of US$1.23 per share, a notable 13% above expectations. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what top analysts are forecasting for next year, and see whether the latest forecasts would suggest a change of heart on the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest forecasts to see what analysts are expecting for next year. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines Following the latest results, Southwest Airlines's 18 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$24b in 2020. This would be a modest 6.9% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Earnings per share are expected to step up 14% to US$5.08. In the lead-up to this report, analysts had been modelling revenues of US$24b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.15 in 2020. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates. Analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$60.21, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Southwest Airlines at US$67.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$48.00. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view. One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. It's clear from the latest estimates that Southwest Airlines's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with forecast 6.9% revenue growth noticeably faster than its historical growth of 3.8%p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same market, which are forecast to grow their","Oct 28, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-luv/southwest-airlines/news/southwest-airlines-co-just-recorded-a-13-eps-beat-heres-what-analysts-are-forecasting-next

The Wall Street expectations game has created an artificially low hurdle for companies to clear every earnings quarter. Case in point: Corporate America is back in a technical earnings recession, yet stocks are pushing record highs again. U.S. stocks raced toward record highs on Monday after a pair of earnings reports from Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA) and AT&T (NYSE:T) came in better than expected. Earnings-inspired gains have been going on for a couple of weeks now, with investors rallying behind positive headlines from big banks and technology juggernauts. The problem with this picture is that corporate earnings have been poor when compared to last year. By Friday’s close, 40% of the companies in the S&P 500 reported third-quarter results. Their blended earnings decline for the quarter is 3.7%. according to FactSet. In other words, earnings are down nearly 4% compared with a year ago. If the trend continues (and it looks like it will), Q3 2019 would mark the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profit declines – the longest stretch in three-and-a-half years. Despite the downtrend, FactSet says 80% of companies to have reported so far have exceeded Wall Street’s profit expectations. Nearly two-thirds (64%) have produced stronger than expected revenues. Perhaps investors haven’t clued in to the artificially low hurdle the Wall Street expectations game has created. As FactSet data clearly show, generating earnings that are ‘higher than expected’ doesn’t take very much.

Messamore | Email | Leave a comment Bill Gates briefly ranked as the world’s richest person again after Amazon’s stock took a tumble this week. That temporarily brought Jeff Bezos’ nearly 24-month reign at the top of the rich list to an end. Bezos’ divorce earlier this year and an Amazon stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) slump delivered the one-two punch that knocked him down to second place. As the Amazon founder’s fortunes declined in 2019, Bill Gates enjoyed a substantial increase in personal wealth. One reason for that is a blowout year for Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT). But another is Gates’ smart investments in other companies. With 60% of his portfolio in equities, Bill Gates is very much a stock market bull. Gates was the richest person in the world for 18 out of the 22 years from 1995 through 2017. In 2009, he partnered with another person to hold the distinction, Warren Buffett, to create the Giving Pledge. Together the duo has amassed billions of dollars for philanthropy, and Gates is very deliberate in how he invests the money.   The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation invests tens of billions of dollars in equities to grow its funds for global health, farming, and sanitation initiatives.

In 2016, JetBlue took an unusual step for an airline: establishing a hub in Silicon Valley to invest in startups that bring fresh ideas to air travel. JetBlue Technology Ventures is working with the startups on technologies for better customer service, a smoother overall travel experience and timely plane maintenance. Since its launch, the venture operation has scanned around 3,000 companies and invested in 28. The airline sees technology as a way to attract and retain passengers in a market driven by pricing. For instance, the airline is testing a better way of predicting airport weather to help redirect flights and notify customers of possible delays, and personalizing travel by remembering where passengers left off in a movie or show between flights. Another focus is on automating check-in, bag drop and boarding via biometrics, such as facial recognition.

Rather than a traditional IPO or a direct listing, it instead merged with publicly traded Social Capital Hedosophia, which took a 49% stake in the merged company. Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and a venture capital investor, founded that company in 2017 as a special-purpose acquisition company. Its stock price, trading under the ticker IPOA, ended at $11.79 Friday, up 20% in the past year. Shares in the new company, with the ticker SPCE, opened at $12.34 and ended down 0.3% from IPOA’s price, at $11.75 each, with a market cap of about $1 billion. Virgin Galactic’s private market valuation, according to Pitchbook, was at one point $1.7 billion. Completing the deal, which was initially announced in July, will net Virgin Galactic about $450 million in primary proceeds, money that it will use to begin its commercial operations, which is expected to happen in 2020. Earlier this year, the company successfully flew its spacecraft to suborbital space, and in August the company unveiled its commercial spaceport terminal in New Mexico. The company has already sold over 600 tickets for flights on its spacecraft, representing over $120 million in potential revenue. After finalizing the merger, Virgin Galactic’s existing shareholders will own about 59% of the combined company. The company’s existing management will remain in place, with SCH directors Adam Bain and James Ryans joining the board. Palihapitiya will be the new chairman of the company. In a statement, Branson expressed his enthusiasm for his company going public. “I believe Virgin Galactic is ideally positioned to capitalize on the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar commercial space market and ultimately open space to thousands of new astronauts,” he said.

Public debut of ThaiBev affiliate pushes market cap","At least 40 companies in pipeline, led by real estate, retail and food SINGAPORE -- Stock listings in Southeast Asia grew 13% in the year through September, bucking a global downtrend and with several high-profile initial public offerings still to hit the market before the end of 2019. Data from consultancy firm EY showed that there were 89 IPOs in Southeast Asia in the year to end-September that raised total proceeds of $4.8 billion, up 1% from the same period a year ago. Globally, there were 768 listings that raised proceeds of $114 billion. Those figures marked falls of 26% and 25%, respectively, as U.S.-China trade tensions, Brexit and other global uncertainties put a lid on IPOs. EY sees this trend in Southeast Asia playing out over the rest of the year. ""Despite ongoing geopolitical and economic challenges, there is still a pipeline of IPO aspirants in Southeast Asia looking for an opportune time to tap the market,"" Max Loh, EY's ASEAN IPO leader, told the Nikkei Asian Review. ""We expect that the surge in activity in the third quarter [of 2019] to spill into the fourth quarter as IPO activity in the region focuses on the Southeast Asian consumption growth story."" Siam Cement Group, a Thai industrial conglomerate, has started the process to list its packaging subsidiary on the Stock Exchange of Thailand to raise funds for expansion, said Roongrote Rangsiyopash, president and CEO of the group on Monday. He said the company’s board of directors approved on Monday the plan to issue new ordinary shares of its subsidiary SCG Packaging, although he declined to comment on when the company would file for the IPO. Two market sources said that SCG is expected to raise at least 30 billion baht ($1 billion) from the IPO. Among other listings in the pipeline is that of Central Retail, a core retail unit of Thailand's major conglomerate Central Group. Central Retail has department stores and other retail outlets in Thailand, and it is also increasing its presence in Vietnam. Through this what is likely to be a billion-dollar IPO, the company aims to expand branches domestically and overseas. The company has filed its prospectus with the SET. Canned tuna producer Thai Union Group's subsidiary Thai Union Feedmill, producer of shrimp and fish feed, has also filed for an IPO. It plans to expand the feed producing business in Indonesia and other countries.","Oct 28, 2019",https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/Southeast-Asia-defies-global-IPO-slump-thanks-to-old-economy-stocks
