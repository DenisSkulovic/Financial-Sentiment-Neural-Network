4,"Forget Airline Stocks, Buy Aerospace Suppliers Instead | The Motley Fool","Forget Airline Stocks, Buy Aerospace Suppliers Instead. Raytheon Technologies, Honeywell, and Heico are probably safer ways to play a recovery","   The commercial aviation industry has obviously taken a major hit from the COVID-19 pandemic and it appears that getting back to 2019 levels is going to be a multi-year event. That said, every stock has its price, and it's no surprise that value investors have been buying airline stocks with an aim of playing the recovery. However, from a historical perspective, it makes more sense to buy the commercial aviation suppliers, like Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), or Heico (NYSE:HEI). Here's why. Companies exist to generate returns for equity investors, but first they are obliged to pay back debtholders. That's a key point to understand with airline stocks, because historically speaking, the airline industry has been good for bondholders, but until recently, not so good for equity holders. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. A look at airline industry profitability and return on invested capital over the years tends to confirm the view the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expressed in a report: ""On average, during previous business cycles, the airline industry has been able to generate enough revenue to pay its suppliers' bills and service its debt."" However, it's only in recent years that ""equity owners have been rewarded adequately for risking their capital in some regions but not all of them"" according to the report. Debtholders are seen as willing to lend to airlines because if it all goes wrong, the physical assets of the airlines (mainly the planes) can be sold off in order to pay the creditors first, while the shareholders are the last in line to be paid. On a historical basis, the big winners from the airline industry have been the debtholders and the aviation suppliers. In fact, it was only in 2015 that the worldwide airline industry started to generate the adequate return on investment necessary to cover their cost of capital -- around 2013 if you are just looking at airlines in North America. With the theory explanation out of the way, here are some specific stock names. Heico, Honeywell, and Raytheon Technologies' Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace businesses are three suppliers who have done well over time.  First, here's a look at the stock prices of aerospace suppliers Heico, TransDigm (another pure play aerospace company) and Honeywell in the years before 2013.

5,Stock Market Wrap-Up: The Airline Rally Could Be Over | The Motley Fool,Stock Market Wrap-Up: The Airline Rally Could Be Over. Large airline stock reversals infer that prices will stay volatile.. Today's,"   Stocks largely gave up ground on Tuesday, falling back but giving up only a small portion of their recent gains over the past couple of weeks. Some market participants are waiting to see whether the Federal Reserve will signal any change in policy when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday, especially in light of the massive rebound in stocks that paints an optimistic picture of the economy's future. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) were both down as much as 1%, but the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) managed to buck the downtrend and gain ground. Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow (1.09%) (300) S&P 500 (0.78%) (25) Nasdaq Composite 0.29% 29 DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. Some of the hardest-hit stocks on Tuesday were those that had performed the best in the recent rally. Airlines were among the biggest decliners, and some industry watchers fear that even though their stocks remain well below where they were before the coronavirus pandemic struck, it could be tough for air carriers to make a lot more progress from here in the short run. The losses for airline stocks spanned the entire industry. Among major carriers, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) saw the biggest drop at 9%, but United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) had to deal with 8% declines. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) saw its stock fall 6%. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. Smaller carriers saw losses in generally the same neighborhood. Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) got hit especially hard with an 11% drop, but other stocks were generally down 7% to 9% on the day. It's important to put today's move in the context of the huge gains that airline stocks have posted lately. On the positive side, the number of travelers taking to the skies has started to move higher, allowing companies to start offering more flights and expand their schedules to some extent. Signs of increased future demand are also making shareholders of airlines more optimistic about their ability to rebound over the long run. Yet today's move seemed to recognize the harsh reality for airlines. Even with recent improvements, travel isn't likely to get anywhere close to where it was before the pandemic in the near future. Some analysts believe it could take years for traffic levels to regain their lost ground. The bigger question is what air travel is going to look like","Jun 9, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/09/stock-market-wrap-up-the-airline-rally-could-be-ov.aspx
6,"Airline Stocks - A Great Buy, or A Lot of Hot Air? | InvestorPlace","Airline Stocks – A Great Buy, or A Lot of Hot Air?. Airlines are still well off the highs. But","   A month ago, airline stocks were struggling…to put it mildly. Six weeks into their sell-off, the group was still hovering around the March lows – after COVID-19 grounded flights and caused the industry basket, U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS), to shed half its value in 11 trading days. Frankly, airlines are still down in the dumps, compared to where they were as recently as February. But the situation is evolving rapidly. So, with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) leading the way back into the skies – and back into stock portfolios – let’s take a look through the same lens I scrutinize any stock before it makes it onto, say, my Growth Investor Buy List. In early May, some analysts argued that first-quarter results were “largely irrelevant.” I countered that, even before they released those earnings, major airlines were already a “Sell” in my Portfolio Grader. That includes Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV): a company I’ve generally admired, and which once brought me a 194% profit thanks to my stock-picking system. Life is starting to resume, and that’s a huge relief. But from a public health perspective, COVID-19 is still out there…and it’s hard enough to keep from getting sick on a crowded flight, with everyone breathing recycled air. So, we’ve got to balance the bullish case – flights restarting, government bailouts – with the not-so-bullish: risk of further outbreaks, and oftentimes, mediocre fundamentals to begin with! Earnings are, well, the bottom line. The great buys I’m finding now are the companies growing earnings – and really “earning” them, by growing sales first – AND doing this over the long haul. Otherwise, the stock is best avoided. Plus, there’s another often-neglected factor that’s becoming increasingly important in the “COVID economy.” Let’s take a look with my Portfolio Grader:  I run my Portfolio Grader scans each Saturday. That way, I get a week’s worth of market data before making the latest call: Buy, Sell or Hold. So, this latest scan on June 6 included a sharp two-day rally among airlines. By Thursday, June 4, the four biggest U.S. airlines (UAL, AAL, DAL and LUV) had announced at least 25% more flights in June than in May. That day alone, airline stocks jumped 15% — even 41%, in the case of AAL, which is ramping up the most. And, even so, all of these airline stocks earned a “D” for their Quantitative","Jun 10, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/06/airline-stocks-a-great-buy-or-a-lot-of-hot-air/
7,LUV Stock Is Still the Strongest of the Airline Stocks | InvestorPlace,Southwest Air Is Still the Strongest Airline Stock. Southwest entered the pandemic the strongest of the airlines and is leaving," Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) entered the COVID-19 era as the strongest of the airline stocks. LUV stock still is.  Southwest opens for trade June 10 at about $36 a share. That’s down almost 30% for the year. But Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NYSE:AAL) and United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) are all down more. Speculators are already making money on the stock, following a bottom below $24 in mid-May. Southwest took $3.2 billion from the CARES Act, including a loan of nearly $1 billion with warrants on 2.6 million shares. So far it has received 70% of the money. The warrants represent a stake of about 3%. With its survival practically assured, assuming the pandemic ends in 2020, Southwest is now planning to ramp up its full schedule by December. Southwest’s plans put it ahead of its rivals with increased flights into Denver, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Nashville, while others are cutting back. It’s still cutting 111 routes, mostly cross-country runs and planes out of Ft. Lauderdale. There it competes with Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ:SAVE) and JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU). While Southwest didn’t do any layoffs during the pandemic lock down, it cut 30% of its positions through buyouts and temporary leaves. In addition to adding routes, Southwest is rejoining part of the booking mainstream. Travel agents on Sabre and Apollo will be able to book Southwest’s U.S. flights as they do other airlines through the Global Distribution Network. U.S. booking will still be handled exclusively by Southwest’s SWABIZ system.  All this has brought Wall Street back to Southwest’s side. UBS recently upgraded it to “buy.” While Southwest is returning to service and passenger traffic is growing, there’s still a question of how far and how fast people return.

While some passengers will jump onto planes quickly, others may wait for a vaccine. (I’m one of them.) The current quarter is expected to be the airline’s low point.

8,Airline Stocks are Rallying and Earning the U.S. Treasury a $300 Million Profit | Aviation Pros,Airline Stocks are Rallying and Earning the U.S. Treasury a $300 Million Profit. AviationPros Podcast: The Year in Review and,"Airline stocks have surged in the last week after optimistic trends in travelers since Memorial Day weekend and steps by carriers to boost schedules. As much as airlines are enjoying the upswing in value, the U.S. Treasury Department may be among the biggest winners after getting concessions during stimulus negotiations that included more than 32 million shares in publicly traded airlines. By mid-day Monday, those “warrants” would net the federal government about a $300 million profit if the Treasury cashed out now. The warrants give the Treasury the right to buy stock for a price agreed to in early April, the worst period for airline traffic and stock prices. Those warrants were among the conditions airlines agreed to in order to get the cash needed to survive, along with agreements to not pay dividends or buy back shares, limits on executive pay and a prohibition from laying off or furloughing employees or cutting pay. As the stock market creeps back towards record territory thanks to a recent rally, airlines have been amongst the biggest winners after falling to historic lows during the last two months with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing carriers to fight for their financial lives. Fort Worth-based American Airlines’ stock started the year around $29 a share but fell as low as $9.04 on May 15 as concerns about high debt levels and a long road to recovery. Some analysts and industry insiders wondered if American Airlines would have to file for bankruptcy. Berkshire Hathaway, which owned about 10% of the shares in the biggest carriers, dumped all of its airline stock in late April. Since then, airlines have gained strength on Wall Street as bankruptcy concerns have dwindled. On Monday, American Airlines’ stock price peaked at about $20 a share for the first time since February after reporting that it was increasing its flight schedule for July. That’s added more than $4 billion in value back to the company’s public evaluation. It’s also made the U.S. Treasury Department look like a wise investor. As part of the $5.8 billion in grants and $1.7 billion in loans given to American in April, the carrier agreed to hand over what amounts to stock options on 13.7 million shares of American Airlines. The Treasury Department has the right to exercise those options at any point during the next five years at $12.51 a share. That’s about a 58% gain and","Jun 9, 2020",https://www.aviationpros.com/airlines/news/21141430/airline-stocks-are-rallying-and-earning-the-us-treasury-a-300-million-profit

BTC-USD.,"                                                   In the past week, American Airlines AAL became the primary newsmaker as it decided to boost its capacity for July owing to improving trends for air-travel demand. Management stated that it intends to operate 55% of its scheduled domestic flights next month compared with the level recorded last July.

American Airlines’ bullish update buoyed the entire space leading the NYSE Airline Index gaining, as was the case in the previous week. Reviewing the past week’s developments, Delta Air Lines DAL too grabbed headlines when it announced an 85% reduction in its schedule for the June quarter. Per a Reuters report, United Airlines UAL will be closing three of its four international bases for flight attendants with air-travel demand dropping to unprecedented levels, especially on the international front. In the past week, May traffic reports were also available from Latin American carriers Gol Linhas GOL and Azul AZUL.  Wrap-Up on the Past Week’s Key Headlines 1. With passenger demand slowly returning to normalcy, Vasu Raja, American Airlines’ senior vice president of Network Strategy, said that “We’re seeing a slow but steady rise in domestic demand”. Evidently, the company flew nearly 110,000 passengers per day on average in the last week of May. The reading reflects a 71% surge from the total passenger count of 32,000 carried per day on average in April. As a result of this spike in traffic, the load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) soared to 55% in the last week of May from a mere 15% in April. The carrier also aims to operate nearly 20% of its international flights scheduled for July compared with the capacity registered in July 2019. The move to drive its domestic as well as international capacity will in turn expand the carrier’s systemwide capacity for July, which will be roughly 40% of last year’s level. 2.

11,Cramer urges investors to be wary of airline and cruise stocks — buy these 5 winners instead,. Cramer urges investors to be wary of airline and cruise stocks — buy these 5 winners instead. News Tips.,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Tuesday urged investors to be wary of piling into airline and cruise stocks, two sectors that have been surging as the U.S. economy reopens from coronavirus-related closures.  Instead, the “Mad Money” host said, people should look to companies that are less dependent on a smooth economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis, such as Facebook, Amazon and AMD.  Cramer said he understands investors may feel the U.S. economy has reached its lowest virus-era level, but argued that airlines, in particular, will struggle to get back to meaningful revenues to justify their soaring stocks.  The NYSE Arca Airline Index, which tracks 16 airlines that mostly are in the U.S., closed more than 7% lower Tuesday but remains up more than 30% in the last five trading sessions. It’s up about 67% in the last month.  “When all your planes are full, man, you’re making a fortune. But when you’re in a recession — even if you’re coming out of a recession — you don’t see tons of full planes,” Cramer said. “And that’s before we even account for the impact of the virus, which will have a chilling effect on air travel until we get the vaccine.”  But Cramer said it is a different picture for the likes of Facebook, Amazon and AMD, as well as Apple and Nvidia.  These five companies have “powerful internal engines that will let them sail without a tailwind,” he said. “You want the stock equivalent of a steamship, not a sailboat that’s at the mercy of the economic weather.”  Shares of Facebook rose more than 3% on Tuesday, a continuation of a strong run for the stock since the company announced Facebook Shops last month, Cramer said.  “At a time when people are understandably reluctant to shop in person, making it easier to sell things via Facebook and Instagram was a brilliant move,” said Cramer, who noted he has been a fan of the company since it began to cater more to the small- and medium-sized businesses that use its services.  In a similar way, Cramer said, Apple set a new all-time high Tuesday for reasons unrelated to the economic reopening or growing sales in China. Rather, he said the usage of Apple Pay has taken off due to the pandemic as people want contact-less payments.  “At the same time, Apple’s service","Jun 9, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/cramer-urges-investors-to-be-wary-of-airline-and-cruise-stocks-buy-these-5-winners-instead.html

You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work, and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. A global pandemic is a tough environment for any business. Lockdown closes off traditional sales channels and “normal” activity is put on hold. For travel companies, however, the pain is much more extreme as even the virtual route followed by some vendors is not viable. No one is going to pay an airline to show them a video of a beach. Around the world, tour operators and airlines are dramatically drawing in their expenditure as trade volumes have collapsed. In March, the UK’s aviation industry saw its economic output fall by almost 50%, according to the Office of National Statistics. The picture for April and May is likely to be no better — and could be dramatically worse.   British Airways, Ryanair and other international carriers have already announced tens of thousands of job cuts between them, with Virgin and Lufthansa also asking for state aid, to get them through the current crisis.  But easyJet, which arguably led the charge into fast, cheap European travel seems to have additional woes to contend with. Towards the end of May, the airline announced it had been the victim of a cyberhack, which had stolen the travel plans of thousands of its passengers. While no credit card or passport details were accessed, the company said, the event posed uncomfortable questions around its ability to withstand modern digital threats. Shareholders may have already been reeling from the £60m paid in dividends to the founder – Stelios Haji-Ioannou – and his family as the size of the Covid-19 impact was coming into view, with another argument brewing between him and the company directors over a contract with Airbus to supply more than 100 new aircraft. Since February – when global stock markets hit their heights – easyJet’s share price has more than halved, threatening to take it out of the FTSE100 index, which tracks the largest UK companies. This would also mean it is automatically sold by many investors choosing to commit their capital to just the largest (and therefore, supposedly robust) UK listed businesses.

14,Warren Buffett Was Wrong: 3 Airline Stocks to Buy as Americans Fly Again – 24/7 Wall St.,. . . . . Warren Buffett Was Wrong: 3 Airline Stocks to Buy as Americans Fly Again. Alaska Air.,"Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors in the history of the stock market. There is absolutely no doubting that claim. However, over the bull market that ran from 2009 until earlier this year, the Oracle of Omaha’s flagship investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&P 500 on a total return basis, which includes reinvested dividends. Buffett stunned the investing community at Berkshire’s May 2 annual meeting, when he said his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate had in April sold its roughly $6 billion of stock in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines. This is not the same Buffett that scooped up bank shares in 2008 and 2009 as they plunged to the lowest levels in years. For a man that usually maintains that betting against the United States is a lousy trade, he sure strayed from his long-time playbook. We screened the BofA Securities airline stock universe looking for Buy-rated companies that make sense for investors now. We found three that are solid ideas for long-term growth investors. This company has a big west coast exposure and continues to rank high on Wall Street. Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE: ALK) is the parent company of Alaska Airlines. The company serves more than 100 cities through an expansive network in Alaska, the Lower 48 states, Hawaii, Canada and Mexico. Despite recent challenges by other carriers for superiority in the Northwest, the company has strong customer loyalty, which has contributed to outstanding earnings and revenue growth. Alaska Air focuses on point-to-point traffic in the Pacific Northwest. However, about 20% of its traffic connects over its hubs in Anchorage, Seattle and, to a lesser extent, Portland. By developing transcontinental markets, and more recently Hawaii, the company has transformed from a largely north-south directional carrier to one with a more balanced network. The BofA Securities team just upgraded the shares to a Buy rating and noted this in a report: Alaska Air is an exceptionally well-run airline, in our view, with strong free cash flow generation and an improving balance sheet. The company is also returning to its low cost roots with solid cost controls, which should help the company in a recovery. Further, we believe Alaska Air is well positioned for a recovery in airline demand as we expect domestic travel and leisure travel to recover first.

15,Are Airline Stocks Too Risky to Buy Right Now? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Are Airline Stocks Too Risky to Buy Right Now?. The case for,"      Victoria Hetherington | June 10, 2020 | More on: AC Airlines are a classic play right now for contrarian opportunities in chewed-up sectors. But what risks are there in this space, and are there hidden dangers that the headline blur fails to recognize? Canadians are likely to take to the skies en masse as soon as it is proven to be safe to do so. Indeed, even with the middle rows of flights off-limits to reduce transmission of COVID-19, airlines are likely to see some improvement this year in terms of bookings. Next year could see a continuation of this recovery, while a successful vaccine would help put airlines back on a flight path to profits. Even then, several restrictions are likely to impact this space, making airlines a weak play for profitability in the near to mid-term. With around 20% of fleets potentially remaining tarmac-bound for approximately three to five years, capacity is likely to be a hot issue for airlines. As with other areas of the economy, a balance of caution is key. Wherever the line between transmission rates and economic recovery is drawn, growth will have to be achieved fast in order to capitalize on a sudden return to air travel. In order to do so, airlines will have to contend with flights operating below capacity. Investors looking for a classic contrarian play should consider Air Canada (TSX:AC), the country’s leading airline stock. A lower-risk play exists in Onex, which bought out WestJet last year for $3.5 billion. The asset management firm has ditched just 6.6% in the last three months, in contrast to Air Canada’s plunge of 32%. However, with greater downside comes greater momentum potential: Air Canada was riding a five-day bounce of 35% at the start of the week. Air Canada has generated a mountain of stenography in the last couple of months. And for good reason: This is Canada’s most prolific airline, after all. But is its stock too much of a risk right now in a portfolio built around sustainable growth? The question hinges on one thing – reaching the bottom. Until Air Canada stops being a falling knife, the downside risk in this name is too great to ignore. But investors intent on adding Air Canada to a stock portfolio may find that they miss out on value opportunities by trying to time the market.","Jun 10, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/06/10/are-airline-stocks-too-risky-to-buy-right-now/
