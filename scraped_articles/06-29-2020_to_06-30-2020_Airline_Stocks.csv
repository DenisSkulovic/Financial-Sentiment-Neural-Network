0,Airline Stocks: Should You Buy or Sell Now?,. . . . . . . . Airline Stocks: Should You Buy or Sell Now?. Should you buy or,"      Adam Othman | June 30, 2020 | More on: AC After going through the mills and raising enough cash to survive, despite the constant bleeding, Air Canada (TSX:AC) has opened a new wound itself. The company recently announced a change in refund policy (which previously was no refund at all), to allow travelers from the E.U. (not the other around) to recoup their cash. This decision is most likely the result of months of the backlash of consumers whose travel plans were disrupted because of the pandemic. Another reason might be WestJet offering a comprehensive refund policy earlier this month. Many people claim that Air Canada’s refunds are still not completely in line with the European Commission regulations. It’s yet to be seen how big a dent it would put on Air Canada’s rapidly depleting treasure chest. But that’s sure to weaken Air Canada’s liquidity, at least on a fractional level. Air Canada’s price has been weakening for a few weeks now. The company is criticizing the government’s restrictions, saying that they are not in coherence with what the rest of the world is doing, and it’s making it harder for the airline industry to recover any sense of normalcy. In Europe, many people are anticipating a second wave of the coronavirus. Some European countries are considering barring American travelers, seeing as it has become the new hot spot of the pandemic, and a wave of travelers can certainly augment the rekindling of the second wave of the pandemic. None of these factors bode well for the airlines. But selling at the current valuation would be folly, especially for people who’d bought into the company at its pre-pandemic prices. They have already lost the bulk of their portfolio growth, and even if it’s a coin-toss between holding on to it at the risk of losing it all and selling at a massive loss, the former might be the more pragmatic choice. As for buying, neither Air Canada nor other airline stocks can be pegged for a sure and swift recovery. Air Canada’s chances of recovering are the best, but it will be a very long and bumpy road. And you can put your money on much better stocks. The best course of action might be to hold on to the crashing giant. Currently, the scale is tipped more towards slow, eventual recovery than a","Jun 30, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/06/30/airline-stocks-should-you-buy-or-sell-now/
1,Airline Stocks Improved in June amid Easing Lockdowns,Airline Stocks Improved in June amid Easing Lockdowns. What happened in June in the US airline sector?. Southwest Airlines got,"UPDATED 6 MONTHS AGO So far, airline companies have struggled in 2020. The sector took a hard hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Air travel halted completely amid lockdowns. Air travel picked up slightly in June when the lockdown restrictions started easing. With the slight uptick in demand, most airline companies made their own growth strategies and plans for the coming months. Many airlines including Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are still struggling. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) are in a better place. With lockdowns restrictions easing in the US, June saw a slight uptick in air travel demand. Business travel and leisure travel hasn’t resumed yet. However, people visiting family and friends boosted air travel demand. Challenges still remain for companies that depend on international travel. Airlines that focus more on domestic routes have seen an improvement. Recently, American Airlines announced its plans to burn zero cash by the end of 2020. The company reduced its cash burn forecast from $50 million to $40 million. Airlines expect a better capacity schedule in July. Meanwhile, United expects to fly 25% of its domestic flight schedule in July. United wants to improve its liquidity position. The company estimates to have available liquidity of around $17 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2020. The airline plans to arrange financing from its loyalty program, MileagePlus. United Airlines has also adopted various cost-cutting measures. Talking about cost-cutting measures, Alaska Air plans to cut 3,000 jobs next year from its existing workforce of 23,000. The airline also adopted various other strategies to conserve cash and survive the pandemic. Delta Air Lines plans to notify around 2,500 pilots about possible furloughs. The company intends to send out notices under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act by next week. To learn more read, Delta Air Lines Warns Pilots about Possible Furloughs. Amid the struggles, JetBlue Airways announced growth plans to better its cash position. The company intends to add 30 domestic routes between July and October.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   In the past week, American Airlines AAL grabbed headlines by virtue of its announcement that flights will be operated to full capacity beginning Jul 1. The decision, which implies that the practice of safe distancing while aboard will no longer be followed amid the rising coronavirus cases, drew flak from multiple corners. Meanwhile, United Airlines UAL, which too is booking flights to 100% capacity, announced plans to resume services to China.  Effective Jul 8, the carrier will reinitiate its China services with twice-weekly flights between San Francisco and Shanghai's Pudong International Airport via Seoul's Incheon International Airport. United Airlines’ decision follows that of Delta Air Lines DAL, which was announced in the previous week. With air-travel demand still remaining way below the pre-coronavirus levels, despite the recent improvement, Delta intends to notify its pilots about possible furloughs by sending them notices later this week. Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1.  American Airlines’ decision to sell every ticket available means that the carrier’s policy (effective since April) of curtailing bookings to about 85% of a plane's capacity will stand invalid. Although this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier has a number of measures in place complying with anti-pandemic directives like cleaning and sanitizing planes with extra care and requiring passengers to wear face masks throughout their journey at most of its hub airports, its resolve to load the entire plane amid the ongoing pandemic crisis invited criticisms from many quarters. Evidently, travel analyst Henry Harteveldt expressed his disappointment over the issue and said that the carrier “is clearly putting its profitability ahead” of the health of both passengers and its own employees. However, airlines like Delta, Southwest Airlines LUV and JetBlue JBLU are still adhering to the rule of restrictive seating capacity, thereby ensuring social distancing.

3,BA: 2 Airline Stocks Worth a Look,2 Airline Stocks Worth a Look. . . About the Author: Patrick Ryan. More Resources for the Stocks in this,"  BA – The Boeing Company (BA) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) shares rose with the market. Are they worth a second look. Jun 30, 2020  The market bounced back from its dip Friday, posting a 580.25 point gain to start the week. Two stocks shined bright: The Boeing Company (BA) and Southwest Airlines (LUV). Let’s take a look at the news, which helped these airline stocks move higher immediately after a significant market pullback. The Boeing Company (BA) BA is well-known as one of the leading manufacturers of passenger jets and aircraft systems used for national defense. BA is so massive that it has become the largest component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. BA clients include our federal government and airlines in the United States and abroad. Also, some commercial communication companies rely on BA in tech systems. 7 Best ETFs for the NEXT Bull Market The stock climbed higher Monday as its 737 Max certification flights received approval. Reuters officially broke the good news on Sunday, announcing the FAA approved the Max plane’s test flights, which had been sidelined since 2019 following two deadly accidents. The certification approval will lead to a resumption of 737 Max flights soon. BA shares rose nearly 8% as a result of the news. The stock has bounced back quite nicely since reaching its floor of $97.71 following the initial spread of COVID-19. As long as the 737 Max pass muster during its certification flights, it should return to the air, helping BA’s stock move even higher. Although the demand for air travel is no longer as robust as it was in years past, BA is likely to trend upward if the 737 Max is proven safe. No one is quite sure what level of demand there will be for the 737 Max in the years to come. Some investors will likely scoop up the stock and possibly hold it for years, assuming air travel will normalize in time. BA has an average analyst price target of $191.31 and a high target of $277, so there is still some room for upward movement. BA returned 3% in 2019 and 11.50% in 2018.

4,AAL Stock: The Party's Over; Sell American Airlines Now | InvestorPlace,"The Party’s Over; Sell American Airlines Stock Now. With new coronavirus cases it's time to run, not walk, from airline"," The last time I weighed in on American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock and its peers,  I said, “The party is over for airlines, especially with ‘second wave’ coronavirus fears making the rounds.” That was on June 11. And, unfortunately, I was right. Most of the top airlines have just begun to fall out of the sky again, including AAL, which just dropped from $22.80 to $13.16. Should the coronavirus ground airlines again, and we begin to see new travel restrictions, AAL stock could easily retest a low of $8.25. While I wish it weren’t true, the party is over for airlines – again. All thanks to that pesky coronavirus that just will not go away. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said parts of the U.S. are seeing a “disturbing surge” in coronavirus infections. In fact, according to CNBC, cases are growing by 5% or more in 26 states, including Arizona, Texas, Florida and Oklahoma. Coronavirus hospitalizations are on the rise as well. Worse, according to former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, some states may be “on the cusp of losing control.” As the situation grows dire again, we could see states and countries close up shop again. We may not be left with much choice. After all, the virus is still infecting about 40,000 people in the U.S. every day. At the same time, it could result in decreased air travel, and a decrease in popular travel destinations. Both could give airlines a big black eye. “There is a new wave coming in parts of the country,” Eric Toner, a senior scholar for Health Security said, as quoted by Bloomberg. “It’s small and it’s distant so far, but it’s coming.” While American Airlines did see some upside in recent weeks, as the global economy reopened, the good times are fading fast. For one, the company is scrambling to raise cash again. That’s why it priced new debt and equity offerings, which will raise $2 billion in additional capital. CEO Doug Parker quelled bankruptcy rumors, noting, “Bankruptcy is failure. We’re not going to do that. I don’t think you’ll see any airline go by the wayside as a result of this crisis.” Unfortunately, a second round of the coronavirus could force it to file anyway. AAL has a shaky liquidity position, says Daren Fonda, a contributor at Barrons. “The airline is adding","Jun 30, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/06/aal-stock-sell-american-airlines-now/

Here’s BofA’s List of,"    Southwest Airlines shares are soaring 7.5% after a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs, amid hopes that testing could help travelers feel safer at airports even as record numbers of new coronavirus infections limit travel. Analyst Catherine O’Brien boosted her rating on Southwest (LUV) to Buy from Sell. She raised her target for the stock price to $47 from $35, writing that she expects the airline’s “primarily domestic network and industry-leading balance sheet to drive a relatively faster and stronger recovery from the COVID-19-driven downturn in demand for air travel.” O’Brien was less upbeat about the airline sector as a whole. On the positive side, she said, passenger numbers have been rising from their April lows, showing pent-up desire to travel. And airlines have done better than she anticipated at reducing the rate at which they are burning through cash. Still, fewer people are traveling than she had anticipated for June, the start of the key summer travel season. Coronavirus cases are spiking in many parts of the country and some states have introduced new quarantine measures for travelers. The upshot is that O’Brien is now predicting “a significantly less steep recovery to 2019 levels of demand” especially for corporate and international travel, leading her to “materially reduce” her earnings-per-share estimates through 2022. “That said, we still are of the view that the industry has restructured over the last 10 years and the earnings power of our airlines coverage will not be permanently impacted post-Covid-19,” she wrote. Her estimates for 2023 and beyond reflect more normal conditions. Southwest was up 7.5% to $34.37 in early afternoon trading. The news comes the same day that Boeing (BA) said regulators would begin testing the 737 MAX aircraft, which has been out of commission for more than a year, and Centogene (CNTG) announced it had agreed to enter exclusive partnerships with Lufthansa and the operator of the Frankfurt airport to make Covid testing available to travelers.  “This partnerships creates the first ‘walk-in’ testing offering in Germany, and is expected to serve as an avenue to help open international borders,” wrote SVBLeerink analyst Puneet Souda. Quick tests by Centogene or other firms, potentially producing results in as little as three hours, could go a long way toward making fliers feel more comfortable.

American Airlines to Start Selling to,"American Airlines  (AAL) - Get Report has been a trading vehicle for a number of investors and speculators over the past few months. Shares were obliterated as the coronavirus swept across the globe, shuttering businesses and nearly grounding airline traffic. American Airlines came into 2020 under pressure already but still fell more than 73% from its February high to the May low. The stunning fall wasn’t reserved for just American, either. Delta Air Lines  (DAL) - Get Report, Southwest Airlines  (LUV) - Get Report and United Airlines  (UAL) - Get Report all felt the pinch too. It didn’t help that Warren Buffett was selling his firm’s stake in all four. In any regard, the airline’s stunning decline enticed some investors to buy, even if the stock caught a $1 price target from one analyst. American went on to rally more than 170% in just a few weeks, rewarding speculators who bought low and sold into resistance. Now what? Daily chart of American Airlines stock. Chart courtesy of Stockcharts.com On the daily chart above, it clearly shows American Airlines stock rallying up to the 200-day moving average, before being rejected from this clear level of resistance. Since then, it has put in a series of lower highs, as downtrend resistance (blue line) squeezes the share price lower. Now though, down 46% from the June highs, bulls may have a solid risk-reward opportunity. Specifically, American Airlines stock has corrected down to the 50-day moving average. Further, the $12.50 area was one of resistance for several months. Seeing this level act as support alongside a key moving average and amid such a swift decline would be bullish. The reason the trade seems attractive though is the limited risk. A close below $12 is enough reason for bulls to cut their losses, as it becomes clear that support, in theory, is not supported in practice. If support holds, look for a move up through the 23.6% retracement, at $13.57. Above that puts downtrend resistance in play, followed by a possible test of the 20-day moving average currently near $15.40. American Airlines stock may very well fail to put together a decent bounce, but the risk/reward is there for aggressive traders.

Kontakt. Newsletter abonnieren. Haftungsdachhinweis," CLAUSIUS 30. JUNI 2020  Issued by Xuemin Jia, Msc, Seahawk Investments GmbH Executive summary: COVID-19 has thrown the global airline industry into the darkest period in history – due to the rapid, massive spread of the virus, almost all countries have imposed lockdown and travel restrictions starting from end of January in China, to mid-March in the U.S. and Europe, until mid-May. As a result, over 80% of global fleets have been grounded in March, airlines have been burning cash every day, airline stocks have been slashed to half of pre-crisis level since then. This pandemic brought a drastic short-term impact on air traffic demand. At present, flight bookings are slowly recovering as the virus spread is fairly under control by now, but it could alter people’s travel behaviour and public health policies – social distancing will become a new normal. Looking back, airlines have experienced some good years as a result of the fast globalization development, the rapidly growing Asian aviation market growth and increasing global GDP growth. Global commercial airline revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% after the global financial crisis. As compared to previous years, airlines in general had lower debt levels and stronger liquidity positions in 2019 which enabled a softer landing during the crisis. We expect low cost carriers (LCC) to get through this crisis in better shape. LCCs are able to operate more efficiently due to their competitive cost structure, smaller scale, lower exposure to international routes and stronger balance sheets. Once travel demand starts to pick up, we expect them to recover at a faster speed to the pre-crisis level. In contrast, many full-service carriers (FSC) had to rely on government aid to survive, which translates into elevated debt and equity dilution. Some flagship carriers have to experience a costly recapitalization before they start to generate profit again. Strings attached to government rescue packages are normally associated with suspended share buybacks, suspended dividends which make their stocks less lucrative. Empirically, airlines needed at least one year after material disruptions to reach operational profitability. Examples are the 2008 financial crisis or the 2003 SARS pandemic. When the lockdown has ended and economies have slowly reopened, domestic air traffic in the US has initially picked up quicker than expected. Market sentiment has suddenly turned very optimistic. However, evaluating the fundamentals of the airline equity market, we believe","Jun 30, 2020",https://www.seahawk-investments.com/2020/06/30/global-airline-outlook-are-airlines-investable-post-covid-19/
9,How COVID-19 has changed investment strategies and the stock market,. . . . COVID-19: stock trading in the new normal. Coronavirus and the stock market: an uncertain recovery. Coronavirus,"Signup  Coronavirus has changed stock trading for the foreseeable future, and investment strategies need to reflect an equities market scarred by crisis June 29, 2020 Hugh Wilson In early-May legendary investor Warren Buffett dumped his entire holding of US airline stocks, booking significant losses and claiming “the world has changed”. Air passenger numbers had been growing by 5 per cent a year before the coronavirus pandemic, but here was the Sage of Omaha backing out of “business as usual”. Was this a taste of the new normal for COVID-19 and the stock market? Not every analyst agreed with Buffett. Governments wouldn’t let airlines fail, they said. Airline stocks had enjoyed an extended bounce after previous financial crises. The hope that history would repeat itself tempted some investors to leap on the shares Buffett unloaded. After all, the worst thing any investor can do is panic, whatever the extremes of short-term price fluctuations. Who will be proved right? The problem for the average stock trader is that everything from March onwards is guesswork. Nobody has experienced a problem like COVID-19. Jeremy Cheah, associate professor of cryptofinance and digital investment at Nottingham Business School, thinks Buffett probably called it right. “Until and unless there is massive restructuring in the airlines industry, it might make a lot of sense to give airline stocks a miss,” he says. “However, the decline is just the tip of the iceberg and symptomatic of what is happening in the wider economy.” Indeed, who would want a portfolio packed with airline, hospitality or travel stocks now? Rupert Thompson, chief investment officer at Kingswood Group, believes that the bricks-and-mortar retail sector is more vulnerable still. “The travel and hospitality sectors have been devastated by COVID-19, but unlike retail they were not in structural decline before and their long-term prognosis depends on whether a vaccine is found.” Which is the fundamental question regarding COVID-19 and the stock market. When might medicine bring normality back? And how can stock trading happen with any degree of confidence when the long-term health of the global economy rests on something which could happen in six, twelve or twenty-four months’ time, or not at all? Without people being willing to work, travel and consume without fear, the economic recovery from COVID-19 could be “L” or “U” shaped, rather than the hoped for “V” graph.

The bank pushed its forecast for a complete airline-industry rebound to 2023 from 2022, citing weakened demand and significant damage to the international travel market. Airlines with more exposure to global travel will see a slower revenue bounce-back, whereas domestic-focused firms will broadly outperform. Southwest Airlines is one of the companies best positioned for the prolonged downturn, the team of analysts led by Catherine O'Brien wrote in a note to clients. Goldman upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""sell"" on Friday and boosted its price target to $47 from $35. The new level implies a 47% from Southwest's Friday closing price.  The firm's domestic network and ""industry-leading"" balance sheet are poised to fuel a quick rebound from coronavirus-induced lows compared to peer airlines, the team said. Though Goldman previously viewed Southwest as lacking the technology needed to outperform, it now sees the business's healthy cash flow as crucial to surviving the pandemic and its economic toll.

The airline's domestic focus and efficient fleet ""will drive a faster recovery to pre-COVID-19 profitability,"" but current share prices don't reflect an appropriate risk/reward for a ""buy"" rating, Goldman said. Of the Big 3 airlines — United, Delta, and American — United is the only to maintain its ""buy"" rating from the firm. The industry leaders will take a hit from their international exposure, and their ties to Boeing's troubled 737 MAX pose additional risks, Goldman said. Yet United pulled off a ""competitive response to growth plans"" following the coronavirus outbreak and doesn't face the same aircraft delivery and maintenance risks seen by its rivals, according to Goldman.
