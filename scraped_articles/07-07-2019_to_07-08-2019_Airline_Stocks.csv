CNBC","Stocks’ record run has hit a wall over the Independence Day holiday stretch. The and Dow retreated for a second trading day in a row Monday after a massive advance in June. The markets could still have more room to run before hitting their next level of resistance, said Mark Newton, technical analyst at Newton Advisors. “We certainly have stretched the upper end of it. But I do think we can make a bit more progress over the next four to six weeks,” Newton said Friday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “I’m still bullish on the S&P. I think we likely get up to 3,040 to 3,070 or so before we stall out.” The S&P 500 would need to rally another 3% to reach the upper end of that range at 3,070. Any move over 2,996 would mark an all-time high. Lagging sectors joining in on the recent move higher also give Newton hope that the rally can continue through the summer. “You look at financials starting to participate. That’s a big plus for stocks being that they’re almost 13% of the S&P. Health care and transports have also been coming back so those are all encouraging signs,” Newton said. “Near term I do think it’s right to bet on higher prices in July and into August before we see any real slowdown,” he said. Mark Tepper, president of Strategic Wealth Partners, said easing monetary policy should support the stock market this year, even if the Federal Reserve does not come out quite as dovish as expected. “The market was basically expecting a 50 basis point cut this month, it’s probably going to be more like 25 basis points so I do believe the Fed is going to cut so the cut is not off the table. It’s just probably going to be a little bit smaller,” Tepper said during the same segment. A strong June jobs report released Friday tempered expectations for multiple rate cuts this year. The current chances of a 25 basis point rate cut at the July meeting sits at 93%, according to CME Group fed funds futures. “The market is going to trade sideways and range-bound through the rest of the year so what should you be doing as an investor? I think it makes sense to have dry powder if you have it.

1,Dow laggard UnitedHealth is a good second-half play: Technical analyst,Bet on this Dow laggard as a second-half play: Technical analyst. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"The prognosis is positive on UnitedHealth Group. That’s at least according to technical analyst Mark Newton, founder of Newton Advisors. With UnitedHealth shares down nearly 14% from their 52-week highs made in December, Newton said Friday that this Dow dud is poised for a breakout. “It’s not always smart to look for laggards and think you’re going to see immediate mean reversion,” he told CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” But UnitedHealth is “starting to show real progress” based on its technical charts, the analyst said.  “I think we’re starting to [see] increasing signs of this stock breaking downtrends from last year, [and we’re] heading into a very seasonally bullish time for this stock, so I do like UnitedHealth,” Newton said. “I think this is one to bet on for the second half of 2019.” Goldman Sachs, down 15% from the 52-week high it reached last August, is also ready to turn, according to Newton. “The financials are starting to show recent evidence of outperformance in the last few days and now evidence of, potentially, yields bottoming out and some signs that the economy might be OK in the short run,” he said. “You’ve seen breakouts in [the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund] and, of course, Goldman Sachs has just also broken out of a downtrend and potentially could close at the highest level of the year this week. All in all, Newton predicted “further progress in the weeks and the months ahead” for UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs, and Strategic Wealth Partners President and CEO Mark Tepper was with him on the former. “UnitedHealth is definitely my favorite pick here,” Tepper said in the same “Trading Nation” interview. “You’ve got a company with unbelievable fundamentals that’s being punished because of all this political noise. There’s this possibility of Medicare for All becoming reality, but, quite frankly, I think the likelihood of that happening is very, very low. I mean, we’re talking ... less than 10% or so. You’d have to see a full-blown Democratic sweep in the election next year.” In Tepper’s view, investors with a longer-term time horizon would do well to buy shares of UnitedHealth, the country’s largest private health insurer. “What you’re able to get here, if you can ride out the next year and a half or so, is a really solid company on sale,” he said. “You’re getting, basically, the industry leader in the managed-care space.

4,British Airways share price hit after record data theft fine | Aviation News | Al Jazeera,British Airways share price hit after record data theft fine. Deterrent. Shares. US Congress to work through weekend on $900bn,"Half a million customers of “the world’s favourite airline” had personal data stolen during a hack of the BA website. British Airways owner IAG is facing a record $230 million fine after half a million customers had their data stolen from its website. BA, whose slogan is “the world’s favourite airline”, plans to appeal against the fine, equivalent to 1.5 percent of the airline’s 2017 worldwide turnover. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said the hack had exposed poor security arrangements at the airline. European data protection rules – known to millions of website users as GDPR – came into force in 2018, and allow regulators to fine companies up to four percent of their global turnover for data protection failures. The attack involved traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site, where customer details such as log in, payment card and travel booking details – as well as names and addresses – were harvested, the ICO said. “People’s personal data is just that – personal,” said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “When an organisation fails to protect it from loss, damage or theft it is more than an inconvenience. That’s why the law is clear – when you are entrusted with personal data you must look after it.” BA’s chairman and chief executive Alex Cruz said he was “surprised and disappointed” by the proposed penalty. “British Airways responded quickly to a criminal act to steal customers’ data,” he said.       “We have found no evidence of fraud/fraudulent activity on accounts linked to the theft.” Professor Karen Yeung, a data governance expert at Birmingham University, said other companies would take notice of the size of the penalty. “This very substantial fine sends a clear and important message to firms of all shapes and sizes about the critical importance of ensuring that they have effective systems in place to comply with data protection laws,” she told Al Jazeera. “Although the basic principles of European data protection law were largely preserved in the GDPR, one of its most significant changes was the introduction of much more powerful enforcement and sanctioning powers for European data protection authorities. “Until the GDPR took effect, it has been too easy for organisations to overlook the importance of complying with data protection laws. This is partly because the tangible harm following a violation, such as a major data breach,","Jul 8, 2019",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/7/8/british-airways-share-price-hit-after-record-data-theft-fine

They also service 120 markets, 31 countries, and 23 currencies using one account login. Interested in buying foreign stocks, and Japanese stocks in particular? There are several different approaches you can take to buy Japanese stock. Read on so you’ll know exactly how to make it happen. Contents Japan’s principal stock exchange is the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The TSE was founded in 1878 and is currently the world’s third largest stock market by market capitalization,  approximately $5.37 trillion as of June 2019.  The TSE combined with 10 other Japanese stock exchanges in 1943 to become the Japanese Stock Exchange, which was closed and restructured after the end of World War II. The Tokyo Stock Exchange officially reopened in May 1949.   During the 1980s, the Japanese stock market dominated other world stock markets and rose notably for 9 years. At one point, it even accounted for as much as 60% of the global stock market capitalization. This almost exponential rally in the Japanese stock market was known as the Japanese asset price bubble.  The Nikkei 225 Index, the main Japanese stock index, traded at 92.50 after the exchange reopened in 1950. By 1980, the index had reached 6,649.50 and on December 29, 1989, at the top of the Japanese asset price bubble, it closed at 38,915.87, which remains the index’s all-time high.  The index then fell precipitously from its high point. It has since traded under 8,000 twice, first in 2003 and then in 2009. The Nikkei 225 index has recovered substantially since the latest dip in 2009 and currently trades at 21,746.38. The TSE merged with the Osaka Stock Exchange in 2012, which resulted in the creation of the Japan Exchange Group (JPX). The JPX currently has 4,004 listings and is a publicly traded Japanese company.  American depositary receipts (ADRs) of JPX trade on the U.S. OTC Markets Group platform (OTCMKTS) under the symbol JPXGY. They can be traded through any U.S. broker with access to OTC Markets’ OTCQX and OTCQB, where many foreign stocks’ ADRs can be traded.  According to Japan’s Financial Instruments Trading Act, Japanese stock exchanges must self-regulate. Japan Exchange Regulation (JPX-R) regulates both the TSE and the Osaka Stock Exchange.

Private,"Some people may give you flack for asking the question, but if you've got disposable dollars to spend on air travel, it's worth considering. Whether it's a business trip or a vacation, a chartered jet allows you to maximize your time at your destination and minimize the number of hours you spend traveling. On the other hand, first class is also a luxurious way to travel, even if it means you have to put up with crowds at airport security and other discomforts of commercial flights. So, which factors determine whether it's better for you to fly first class or charter a private jet? There’s no reason to consider both options if you can only afford one, so let’s get the financial elephant in the room out of the way. A private jet is more expensive than a first-class seat, which can run anywhere from $800 to thousands of dollars. According to Greg Richman, president of on-demand charter service Skyjet, price depends on the plane size, “Light Jets start at $2,800 per hour. Mid-Size Jets start at $3,800 per hour. Super Mid-Size Jets start at $4,500 per hour. Large Cabin Jets start at $6,500 per hour.” On a commercial aircraft, you rent a seat. If you want to bring somebody with you, you rent two seats and pay double the cost. If you want to bring seven other people on a trip from Los Angeles to Vegas, which takes about an hour, you pay up to $8,000 to fly first class on a commercial jet with eight people.

11,What Strategies Do Companies Employ to Increase Market Share?,What Strategies Do Companies Employ to Increase Market Share?. . What Is Market Share?. Understanding Market Share. How Can Companies,"Companies increase market share through innovation, strengthening customer relationships, smart hiring practices, and acquiring competitors. A company's market share is the percentage it controls the total market for its products and services. Market share is calculated by measuring the percentage of sales or percentage of units a company has in the overall market. Using the percentage of sales method, if a company has $1 million in annual sales and the total sales for the year in its industry is $100 million, the company's market share is 1%. Under the percentage of units method, a company that sells 50,000 units annually in an industry where 5 million units are sold per year also has a market share of 1%. A higher market share puts companies at a competitive advantage. Companies with high market share often receive better prices from suppliers, as their larger order volumes increase their buying power. Also, increased market share and greater production go hand-in-hand, with the latter decreasing a company's cost to produce an individual unit due to economies of scale. Innovation is one method by which a company may increase market share. When a firm brings to market a new technology its competitors have yet to offer, consumers wishing to own the technology buy it from that company, even if they previously did business with a competitor. Many of those consumers become loyal customers, which adds to the company's market share and decreases market share for the company from which they switched. By strengthening customer relationships, companies protect their existing market share by preventing current customers from jumping ship when a competitor rolls out a hot new offer. Better still, companies can grow market share using the same simple tactic, as satisfied customers frequently speak of their positive experience to friends and relatives who then become new customers. Gaining market share via word of mouth increases a company's revenues without concomitant increases in marketing expenses. Companies with the highest market share in their industries almost invariably have the most skilled and dedicated employees. Bringing the best employees on board reduces expenses related to turnover and training, and enables companies to devote more resources to focusing on their core competencies. Offering competitive salaries and benefits is one proven way to attract the best employees; however, employees in the 21st century also seek intangible benefits such as flexible schedules and casual work environments.

13,Why the Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue for American Airlines (AAL),. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"                                 If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider American Airlines (AAL). This company, which is in the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, shows potential for another earnings beat. When looking at the last two reports, this world's largest airline has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 1.96%, on average, in the last two quarters. For the most recent quarter, American Airlines was expected to post earnings of $0.51 per share, but it reported $0.52 per share instead, representing a surprise of 1.96%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.02 per share, while it actually produced $1.04 per share, a surprise of 1.96%. Price and EPS Surprise Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for American Airlines lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. American Airlines currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.59%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.

Spot gold fell 0.4% to $1,390.21 per ounce at 10:42 a.m. EDT (1442 GMT). The session trough of $1,386.11 was its lowest since July 2. U.S. gold futures for August delivery shed 0.5% to $1,392.50 per ounce.

Powell's two-day testimony before the U.S. Congress starts on Wednesday. ""If Powell confirms a dovish view, we will see some renewed dollar weakness and support for gold; bond yields will also find some support,"" said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen. Otherwise, he said, gold ""could see some additional long liquidation."" Market expectations of a 25-basis-point cut were at 98%, with chances for a 50-basis-point cut reduced to 5.9% from 25% last week. Investors also think there is a higher chance the Fed will not cut rates in September. The dollar held near a three-week high versus a basket of major currencies, supported also by news the United States and China were set to relaunch trade talks this week. However, the outlook for gold remained positive, with analysts citing support from Middle East tensions, the trade war and buying by central banks. Top gold consumer China's reserves jumped to $87.27 billion from $79.83 billion at end-May. On the technical front, gold is consolidating around $1,400, plus or minus $20 per ounce, said Samson Li, a Hong Kong-based precious metals analyst at Refinitiv GFMS. Meanwhile, hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish stance in COMEX gold in the week to July 2.

Any change in the short term outlook could have a negative impact on prices","Jul 8, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-edges-lower-dollar-firms-044509249.html

Related Stocks.","   (RTTNews) - Low-cost airline flyadeal, a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Airlines, cancelled an order for 30 Boeing 737 Max aircraft after two fatal crashes involving the jets in Ethiopia and Indonesia as well as other safety risks identified recently. The provisional order for the narrow-body aircraft was announced by Boeing in December last year. The deal, valued at up to $5.9 billion at list price, also included an additional option to purchase 20 more 737 Max aircraft. flyadeal selected the 737 MAX 8 as it has capacity for 189 passengers in a one-class configuration. Compared to flyadeal's current fleet of A320s, the MAX 8 carries 12 more passengers and provides 8 percent lower operating costs per seat. Boeing has been reeling under the impact of two deadly crashes of its 737 Max aircraft within a short span of five months that killed a total of 346 people. The 737 MAX 8 is Boeing's best-selling aircraft. Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded globally on safety concerns following the Ethiopian Airlines crash in the outskirts of Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa in March that killed all 157 people on board. It was the 737 Max's second disaster, after 189 people were killed on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October last year.  While Boeing is working hard with regulators to get the 737 MAXs back in the air, flyadeal has switched sides to its competitor Airbus to announce a similar deal for 30 A320 NEO aircraft and options for a further 20 A320 NEO family aircraft. Deliveries of the flyadeal aircraft will commence in 2021. flyadeal said the order is in response to continuing growth in passenger demand across domestic, regional and international routes. This order will result in flyadeal operating an all- Airbus A320 fleet in the future. The Airbus order is also part of an agreement signed with Saudi Arabian Airlines Corp. (SAUDIA) during the Paris Air Show in June this year for a total of 100 aircraft. The additional aircraft are part of the dual brand strategy of the Saudi Arabian Airlines where flyadeal serves the price conscious customer that is seeking Everyday Low Fares. flyadeal, which began operation in September 2017 to serve domestic destinations, currently operates a fleet of 11 Airbus A320-200 aircraft.","Jul 8, 2019",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/boeing-loses-saudi-airline-s-737-max-contract-to-airbus-1028335124
