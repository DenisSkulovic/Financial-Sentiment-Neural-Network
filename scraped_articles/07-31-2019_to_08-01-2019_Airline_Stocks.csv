1,7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends | InvestorPlace,7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends. These stocks will likely go higher even if economic growth doesn't.," Source: Shutterstock [Editor’s note: This story was previously published in April 2019. It has since been updated and republished.] If you’ve been worrying about whether the boom already is over or when it will end, it might be time to start looking for some recession-proof stocks to buy to get you through the lean times. Even if you don’t believe those times are not here yet, they very well soon could be. Consider this: The March 2009 low of the S&P 500 occurred more than ten years ago. Since 1945, the average economic expansion has lasted just under five years. This factor in itself should indicate the economy is currently in the late stages of the current economic expansion. For this reason, investors should have a plan in place to invest in defensive stocks. While such a shift will likely bring the S&P 500 down, some investors become wealthier in such conditions. Contrary to popular belief, some stocks move higher during economic downturns as changing consumer habits create opportunity. These seven companies should prosper in such times. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  Costco (NASDAQ:COST) offers much to consumers during hard economic times. With the need to save money, people will dine in more. They will often buy in bulk and will still prefer high-quality goods. All of these factors work in Costco’s favor. Moreover, while other retailers have struggled, Costco’s growth continues. Same-store sales increased by 5.5% during the fiscal third quarter of 2019. However, this number matters little to the bottom line. Due to its pricing, nearly all of Costco’s profit comes from its memberships. Membership renewal rates have held at around 90% despite 2018’s membership price increase. Further, with new locations opening and expansion into China underway, membership increases will continue. In 2017, the sentiment that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would take over retail hit Costco and other retailers hard. However Costco had a pretty good 2018 and the stock has seen steady growth. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  With millions facing unemployment or underemployment during downturns, people find themselves with more free time. This creates an opportunity for Disney (NYSE:DIS) to serve as one of the downturn stocks to buy as they provide low-cost entertainment. Many regard its content library as the best available. This coincides well with the coming launch of Disney’s streaming service. Disney","Aug 1, 2019",https://investorplace.com/2019/08/7-downturn-stocks-buy-boom-ends/

8,The Customer Experience Provided by Budget Airlines - Cxceed,. The Customer Experience Provided by Budget Airlines. . The Experience. . Ryanair. . Wizz Air. . easyJet. . Jet2.,"Travelling for business, having elderly parents living abroad and the odd holiday overseas means that I regularly fly short-haul. The air miles quickly mount up, and in the past year, I've caught 26 flights - all with budget airlines. I'm a simple man, the cheapest airlines will do for me. Flying so often with Wizz Air, Ryanair, Jet2 and easyJet, I've noticed quite a lot of differences between them and the customer experience (CX) they deliver. Plenty of blogs out there discuss the baggage allowances each airline allows but I'm going to miss that out. Instead, I'm going to give you an airline comparison focusing on the customer service each provides and how much I enjoy traveling with them. Each airline has a different feel about it; if they were all flying the same route, I would choose them in this order: 1. Jet2
2. easyJet
3. Wizz Air
4. If you were forcing me, Ryanair Let's do an airline comparison to see why. Starting on a positive note; Ryanair's coffee is superb. They serve you Lavazza filter coffee in clever meshed lid cup which allows you to drink from them, without taking the lid off. The planes are always modern, but the legroom is just OK (bear in mind, I'm 6 foot). It's one of the cheapest airlines if you're flying light. Now the negatives. They fly to some second-tier airports that are not even close to the cities that bear their name, such as Frankfurt-Hahn Airport which is a 77-mile drive to Frankfurt City Centre. I'm always on edge when booking Ryanair. They appear to delight in catching people out and making them pay a fine. The staff always appear tired, their uniforms look like they have seen better days, and many of them give the impression that they are looking forward to their shift finishing. Despite the great coffee, you can never relax, with more announcements than a racecourse blasting over the tannoy, and they are always trying to sell you something, such as their ""charity"" scratch-cards (which according to The Sun, you have a 1.2 Billion to 1 chance of winning the jackpot, and they give just 0.3% of the profits to charity). Ryanair seems to love treating people poorly, and I've met plenty of people who refuse to fly with them.   Wizz Air is an Eastern European airline whom I would describe as professional and functional.","Aug 1, 2019",https://www.cxceed.com/the-customer-experience-provided-by-budget-airlines/
9,Why American Airlines Group Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAL) Use Of Investor Capital Doesn’t Look Great - Simply Wall St News,Why American Airlines Group Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAL) Use Of Investor Capital Doesn’t Look Great. Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is,"Today we'll evaluate American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) to determine whether it could have potential as an investment idea. To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business. Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE. ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.' The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) Or for American Airlines Group: 0.088 = US$3.7b ÷ (US$62b - US$20b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.) Therefore, American Airlines Group has an ROCE of 8.8%. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group When making comparisons between similar businesses, investors may find ROCE useful. Using our data, American Airlines Group's ROCE appears to be significantly below the 12% average in the Airlines industry. This could be seen as a negative, as it suggests some competitors may be employing their capital more efficiently. Separate from how American Airlines Group stacks up against its industry, its ROCE in absolute terms is mediocre; relative to the returns on government bonds. It is possible that there are more rewarding investments out there. American Airlines Group's current ROCE of 8.8% is lower than 3 years ago, when the company reported a 19% ROCE. This makes us wonder if the business is facing new challenges. It is important to remember that ROCE shows past performance, and is not necessarily predictive. Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company. Liabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be","Aug 1, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group/news/why-american-airlines-group-inc-s-nasdaqaal-use-of-investor-capital-doesnt-look-great

USD/JPY.,"                                                   (Adds OSC's response) By Shanti S Nair Aug 1 (Reuters) - The Ontario Securities Commission has opened an investigation into CannTrust Holdings Inc, the cannabis producer said on Thursday, less than a month after the health regulator found unlicensed pot cultivation by the company. CannTrust said the inventory and biological assets affected by Health Canada's action to be about C$51 million as at June 30. This is the first time that the company has provided an estimate. The company said it would miss the deadline to file its interim results for the three and six months ended June 30 due to the ""significant uncertainty"" on the valuation of its inventory, assets and revenue recognition related to Health Canada's pending decisions. Health Canada had placed a hold on about 5,200 kg of dried cannabis harvested in the five unlicensed rooms, while CannTrust put a voluntary hold on 7,500 kg of inventory produced in the rooms. The company, which is exploring a possible sale, said while the potential impact of the violations were still unknown, it may force restatement of some of its historical financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the periods ended Dec. 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019. The company suspended the sale and shipment of all its cannabis products on July 11. The Joint Serious Offences Team (JSOT), a partnership of the OSC and police formed to target fraud, market manipulation and other such offenses, will handle the investigation. The company, which fired its chief executive officer and chairman, also said it had applied for a management cease trade order until it files the financial statements. An order will prevent trading in the company's securities by the CEO, CFO, directors or other persons who had or may have access to material information not publicly disclosed. The OSC confirmed it had an active JSOT investigation without providing further details.

13,Air India flyers can now travel seamlessly to Fiji from 3 Indian cities - The Financial Express,"Air India flyers can now travel seamlessly to Fiji from 3 Indian cities. In simple terms, passengers of the Air","Air India passengers can now fly seamlessly from Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai to Fiji via Hong Kong or Singapore. A codeshare pact has been inked between the national carrier of India and flag carrier of Fiji, Fiji Airways.

(BBDb.TO) plunged after lowering its 2019 financial forecasts because of new costs in its troubled rail-equipment division. Additional outlays of as much as $300 million are needed to complete late-stage train projects and meet delivery schedules, Bombardier said in an earnings release Thursday. The company predicted free cash flow usage of $500 million, burning twice as much as the worst-case scenario in the previous forecast. Bombardier is struggling to right its rail business, which already prompted the company to cut its 2019 outlook in April. The latest woes are marring Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare’s turnaround effort, in which he is exiting commercial-aircraft manufacturing to focus on making private jets and trains. “It appears that the stock is not quite done with noisy quarters,” Stephen Trent, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in a note to clients. He called Bombardier’s second-quarter results and weaker outlook “disappointing.” The shares dropped 19 per cent to $1.84 at 9:32 a.m. in Toronto after sliding as much as 22 per cent for the biggest intraday drop in three months. Bombardier advanced 12 per cent this year through Wednesday, trailing the 22 per cent gain of a Standard & Poor’s index of Canadian industrial stocks.
