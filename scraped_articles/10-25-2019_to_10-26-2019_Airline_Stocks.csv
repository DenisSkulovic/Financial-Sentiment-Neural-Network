1,Investors are hoping stocks can beat the Fed meeting curse this time,Investors are hoping stocks can beat the Fed meeting curse this time. Why the sell-off?. Will stocks fall again?. ‘Mid-cycle,"(This story is part of the Weekend Brief edition of the Evening Brief newsletter. To sign up for CNBC’s Evening Brief, click here.) We’ve been here before – several times, and not long ago. A plodding but steady rally is drawing the S&P 500 toward a new record high as investors lean on modest interest rates and firm credit conditions to support the market as corporate profits flatten out. Near the crest of a rally, a Federal Reserve policy meeting awaits. This captures the current market field position, with the S&P 500 just a hair below a record high after a nearly 7% rebound from its August low as a Fed decision awaits on Wednesday. It also describes the setup ahead of each of the last five Fed meetings dating back to March. Within days of each of those prior meetings, the S&P 500 entered a pullback of between 2% and 7% over the subsequent weeks. The most severe of those drops, at more than 6% each, came after the May 1 and July 31 meetings, which like the upcoming meeting were about halfway through an earnings-reporting season in which investors were placated by better-than-feared results.  The retreats in stocks coinciding with earlier Fed meetings were not particularly violent or long-lasting. And they were not hostile reactions to any Fed surprise: The decision in each case was as anticipated, with more dovish language leading to quarter-point rate cuts both in July and September. Another quarter-point cut is generally expected for next week as well, though beyond that the outlook is less clear. It seems the Fed news this year simply concentrated attention on what has been an uncomfortable perceived trade-off between economic growth and easier Fed policy, with significant concern in past months that the central bank was at risk of acting too slowly or ineffectively to support the economy given the unpredictable pressure of a trade-war being felt. After each Fed meeting this year, too, the 10-year Treasury yield declined, at least initially, which has served as a restraint on equities. Stock investors have preferred higher yields as a sign the economy is holding up well and risk appetites are recovering. The 10-year Treasury has moved up appreciably from its August and early-October lows near 1.5%, settling Friday at 1.80%. This has rebuilt a positive spread between long- and short-term Treasuries, undoing the inverted yield curve which crystallized","Oct 26, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/26/investors-are-hoping-stocks-can-beat-the-fed-meeting-curse-this-time.html
2,Southwest Airlines Reports Record Earnings Despite 737 MAX Headwinds | The Motley Fool,Southwest Airlines Reports Record Earnings Despite 737 MAX Headwinds. The cost of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding continues to add,"   The grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX has been extremely costly for a slew of airlines around the globe. As the largest operator of 737s in the world -- and the launch customer for the 737 MAX -- Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has experienced some of the biggest impacts. The carrier expected to have 75 737 MAX jets operating by the end of 2019, but it will instead have none, having canceled all 737 MAX flights through Feb. 8, 2020. The resulting fleet shortage has already cost Southwest hundreds of millions of dollars, and the tally of damages keeps growing. However, Southwest Airlines has been able to overcome this obstacle and post strong earnings results throughout 2019. That trend continued last quarter. Entering Q3, Southwest Airlines expected adjusted nonfuel unit costs to surge 9% to 11% in the quarter, driven almost entirely by the impact of the 737 MAX grounding. As Southwest's management has noted repeatedly this year, the company's costs are largely fixed once it sets its initial schedule for any period. On the plus side, Southwest expected to achieve a solid 3% to 5% increase in revenue per available seat mile (RASM) in the third quarter. Additionally, it projected that fuel costs would decline to between $2.05 per gallon and $2.15 per gallon, down from $2.25 per gallon a year earlier, partially offsetting its nonfuel cost headwinds. Altogether, this forecast suggested that earnings per share would be roughly flat year over year in Q3. Fortunately, Southwest Airlines reduced its nonfuel unit cost forecast by 1 percentage point last month. And on Thursday, the company reported that it beat its updated guidance, as adjusted nonfuel unit costs increased 7.6% for the quarter, largely due to lower-than-expected airport costs. Fuel costs also came in near the low end of the company's guidance range, at $2.07 per gallon. THE BOEING 737 MAX GROUNDING IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON SOUTHWEST'S UNIT COSTS. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. Meanwhile, RASM increased 4.2% last quarter, edging in just ahead of the midpoint of Southwest's guidance. The net result was that the carrier's operating margin ticked up slightly on a year-over-year basis and EPS rose 14% to $1.23, blowing past the average analyst estimate of $1.08. Excluding a $0.05 benefit from favorable tax adjustments in the quarter, Southwest still would have posted a solid 9% EPS gain.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   The Renault Formula 1 team acknowledges its now-illegal braking system was a driver aid but was ""absolutely convinced"" of its legitimacy because it was introduced before this season. Renault was disqualified from the Japanese Grand Prix after a detailed investigation by the FIA led to a decision this week that the team was utilising a braking system that adhered to technical regulations but combined to facilitate a sporting regulations breach. The French manufacturer opted not to appeal the decision but stands by the system, and team boss Cyril Abiteboul explained Renault had not sought clearance from the FIA for the design itself because ""it's a technology that's been used for a while"". ""Another party [Racing Point] has decided to ask for an opinion,"" he said. ""The normal course would have been to ask the FIA to issue a technical directive, or to engage a discussion with us directly, not in the context of a race, not through the stewards. In that case we could have the opportunity to change. ""Before that event of Suzuka, there was never such discussion or speculation regarding the legality of our system. ""[Approaching the FIA] is not something we've done because we were absolutely convinced, as further demonstrated, that we were legal. ""And we were legal from a technical perspective."" Abiteboul accepted that ""it is a driver aid, but a number of things are a driver aid"", highlighting automatic energy recovery system deployment as an example. ""At some point you need to accept there is an element of subjectivity [in the rules],"" he added. ""It's been used since so many years that we never thought it could be put into question until what happened presently."" Asked specifically how long Renault has used the system, he replied: ""I don't want to go into details but it's not from this season. ""It's from before.""

4,"Age tells; maintenance costs mar IndiGo Q2 results, stock down 9%","Age tells; maintenance costs mar IndiGo Q2 results, stock down 9%. . ","  MUMBAI : InterGlobe Aviation Ltd’s reported loss of over Rs1,000 crore for the seasonally weak September quarter was way larger than what investors expected. One reason for this massive loss was because the airline had to make a provision worth Rs320 crore towards maintenance on its older A320ceo aircrafts, resulting in a sharp spike in maintenance costs. InterGlobe runs the IndiGo airline, India’s largest by market share. On the National Stock Exchange, shares of InterGlobe Aviation were down 9% at ₹1,516 in early deals on Friday. While the surge in maintenance cost was an unpleasant surprise, it is not a one-quarter phenomena. Higher maintenance costs are here to stay. . “This cost should continue to be in similar range for the next couple of quarters. This maintenance cost should eventually go away around 2022 as the neos become a larger portion of our fleet and these older ceo planes are redelivered,"" said Aditya Pande, IndiGo’s new chief financial officer, in a results earnings conference call on Thursday.  That apart, employee costs jumped as well, hurting profitability. This comes at a time when IndiGo’s revenues increased by a robust 31% year-on-year, helped by better yields and capacity expansion. Poor earnings show has led to a swift cut in earnings estimates by analysts. “Although the deterioration in cost structure is not structural, it could remain elevated till Airbus is able to expedite deliveries to replace IndiGo’s older fleet. Given the weak performance we recalibrate earnings resulting in 41%/9% cut in our FY20/FY21e earnings per share,"" said SBICAP Securities in a report on 24 October. Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd has cut IndiGo’s FY20 & FY21 Ebitdar by 30.3% & 22%, respectively and downgraded its rating on the stock from BUY to HOLD. “This is owing to the increase in maintenance cost due to re-assessment of maintenance contracts of older A320ceo, cut in FY20 capacity addition guidance from 30% to 25%, weak domestic yield environment and overhang of ongoing promoter feud,"" wrote Paarth Gala of Prabhudas Lilladher in a report on 24 October. Ebitdar is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and lease rentals - a key measure of profitability for airlines. To be sure, IndiGo was expected to post a loss for July-September period, which as mentioned earlier is a seasonally weak quarter. However, estimates for loss were quite low.

5,4 investing lessons from the Yes Bank debacle,. . . . 4 investing lessons from the Yes Bank debacle. Recent in Library. Emerging Markets Outlook 2021. How,"Yes Bank investors are a bruised lot. Thanks to the bank’s aggressive lending strategy and concentrated exposures, the quality of its loan book deteriorated. The bank then erred by trying to hide the stress using technicalities. And the downfall was rapid. In hindsight, all of us are smart. Yet, there are valuable lessons we can all learn from this saga. Stock and Ladder tackles this by looking at the red flags that were evident all along. 1) Promoter feuds spell trouble Make no mistake about it: a management’s acumen, foresight, integrity, and motivation all make a huge difference in shareholder returns. - Seth Klarman The management plays a pivotal role in investor’s wealth creation. Corporate history is replete with examples of feuding promoter families involved in boardroom battles , public spats and an “open war” to wrest the management control. Not only does this tarnish the company’s image, but diverts the attention of the management towards managing the adverse PR and firefighting, when it actually should be focused on strategizing and overseeing the direction of the company. Needless to say, over time this could lead to destruction of shareholder wealth. Something similar happened in Yes Bank’s case too. The differences among promoter families (Kapur Vs Kapoor) began as early as 2009 when Ashok Kapur met with an untimely death. Ever since, his wife Madhu Kapur has been fighting the Kapoor’s in the court. You can read some background on it here. LESSON: Promoter infighting is a red flag. There is no one-size-fits-all formula. Do a careful analysis with the available information before deciding the next move. 2) Corporate governance matters Managers that always promise to ‘make the numbers’ will at some point be tempted to make up the numbers.- Warren Buffett Minority “outsider” shareholders are mostly at the mercy of the “insider” management when it comes to shareholder wealth creation. Managements perceived to be honest with a history of actions supporting their integrity are usually rewarded with a premium by the market. The opposite is also mostly true. Does the mention of Satyam, Kingfisher airlines, Fortis, Ricoh India ring a bell? All had issues of corporate governance to outright fraud which resulted in massive destruction of shareholder wealth. In the case of Yes Bank, the massive under-reporting of non-performing assets to the tune of Rs 6,355 crores in 2016-17 should have been a case for concern.

Moreover, it cut its capacity expansion targets for 2019-20 by 5 percentage points. The country's biggest airline by market share reported a surprise loss on the back of higher maintenance costs and mark-to-market losses. The company had a loss of Rs 651.5 crore in the same period a year ago. ""In a historically weak quarter, we registered a negative profit before tax margin of 12. 7 per cent compared to 16 per cent margin loss registered in the same quarter last year.

Maintenance costs spiked as IndiGo was forced to reassess the expense of leasing and maintaining older Airbus A320ceo planes to fill a gap caused by the grounding of newer A320neo aircraft due to engine issues, Chief Financial Officer Aditya Pande said on a call with analysts on Thursday, Reuters reported.

Is Copa Holdings still cheap?.","Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA), which is in the airlines business, and is based in Panama, saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Copa Holdings’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Copa Holdings Good news, investors! Copa Holdings is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $201.08, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Copa Holdings’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity. Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Copa Holdings. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? Since CPA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CPA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock.

12,Twitter (TWTR) Stock's Massive Dump Puts It Dangerously Close to IPO Price,Twitter (TWTR) Stock’s Massive Dump Puts It Dangerously Close to IPO Price. Hedge Fund Manager: Dump Is an ‘Overreaction’. Will,"By: Kiril Nikolaev | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. The U.S. tech industry is having a less than stellar 2019. This year, unicorn companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Slack have failed to live up to expectations. On top of those firms, shares of other newcomers such as Pinterest, Fiverr, Peloton, and Zoom have tanked over the last few months. Speaking of tanking shares, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) appears to be following the trend. Shares of the microblogging social media platform took a nosedive Thursday, declining over 20% after the company released its Q3 earnings report. The Jack Dorsey-led company missed Wall Street estimates on profits and revenues. The company generated $824 million in revenues, which is lower than consensus expectations of $837.9 million. In addition, Twitter posted an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.05, which is far from analysts expectations of $0.20 per share. As a result, the tech company had to lower guidance for its fourth quarter. Twitter expects revenues between $940 million and $1.01 billion, which is below forecasts of $1.06 billion. Although the Q3 earnings report had elements that made Twitter look bad, it also delivered solid news that can help the company get out of the rut. For instance, Twitter’s monetizable daily active users (mDAU) climbed from 124 million last year to 145 million this year to reflect a 17% year-over-year growth. This is an indication of the company’s accelerating global growth. The chart above reveals that Twitter’s mDAU has been steadily growing over the last four quarters. This is an indication that the company is growing its revenue base which it can leverage later on. Perhaps, this is one of the reasons why Douglas Kass, a hedge fund manager, believes that the 20% plunge was unreasonable. Douglas Kass is not the only hedge fund manager who’s bullish on the stock. Will Meade, also a hedge fund manager, believes that Twitter will bottom out and surge in 2020 because of the presidential elections. Mr. Meade is not alone in his view that Twitter is close to bottoming out. The widely-followed Trader Stewie also believes that the price will stabilize soon as it approaches a strong support area between $28-$30. We also talked to Ian McMillan, CMT, a market technician at ClientFirst/Adaptive. He also sees a solid support around $30.

14,Parents: Pay for Your Child’s Education With This 1 Stock! - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Parents: Pay for Your Child’s Education With This 1 Stock!. List of,"      Chen Liu | October 26, 2019 | More on: CAE CAE With a market capitalization just $200 million apart, Beyond Meat and CAE (TSX:CAE)(NYSE:CAE) are somewhat similar. Luckily for investors, the similarities end there. Beyond Meat’s stock price has increased 120% since its IPO in May 2019. CAE’s stock price has increased 799% since its IPO in 1995. In my opinion, Beyond Meat’s stock is overvalued with revenues of $88 million at year-end 2018, despite having a market capitalization of $8.85 billion. At a more realistic market capitalization of $8.69 billion with $3.3 billion in revenues, CAE clearly has a more proportionate valuation. CAE is a global company that offers training for civil aviation, defence, security, and healthcare. It specializes in simulators and synthetic exercises that are alternatives to real life training. Air Canada is one of its clients, and the benefits from using the simulator include saving on fuel that would be used for training purposes as well as preventing a real plane from crashing in the event that the student pilot makes an error. CAE is a worthwhile investment due to its list of clients and increasing operating incomes The beauty of CAE is its leading market position in the simulation industry. In addition to partnering with Air Canada for its flight training needs, it is also engaged in joint ventures with some of the world’s largest companies. In its airline division, the company partners with China Eastern, Emirates, IndiGo, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa, and Singapore Airlines, just to name a few.

15,IndiGo’s Shares Fall Over 9% After Airline Posts Surprise Q2 Loss - Goodreturns,"JUST IN. DON'T MISS. SPONSORED CONTENT. IndiGo’s Shares Fall Over 9% After Airline Posts Surprise Q2 Loss. More INDIGO News
","Shares of InterGlobe Aviation, the parent company of IndiGo Airlines, fell by as much as 9.3 percent on Friday to Rs 1,507.30 as they reacted to the budget carrier posting its biggest-ever quarterly loss. On Thursday, the budget airline reported a surprise quarterly loss due to higher maintenance costs. It also cut its capacity expansion targets amid slowing passenger growth in the industry and a sluggish economy.  InterGlobe's net loss was at Rs 1,062 crore for the September-ended quarter. This is the second time that the airline as reported losses for a quarter. In the same period of the previous year, it had reported a loss of Rs 651.5 crore. IndiGo's maintenance costs spiked in the quarter under review as it said that it was forced to reassess the expense of leasing and maintaining older Airbus A320ceo planes to fill a gap caused by the grounding of newer A320neo aircraft due to engine issues, said Chief Financial Officer Aditya Pande on a call with analysts on Thursday, according to a Reuters report. The company cut its expectations for capacity expansion for 2019-20 to 25 percent from 30 percent as it blamed it on the 3-4 month delay in aircraft deliveries by Airbus. For 2020-21, the capacity growth is projected at 25 percent. Even as IndiGo flew more customers on a year-on-year basis, the overall domestic passenger traffic in India rose only 1.2 percent from the same period a year ago, the slowest increase since March and the second worst pace in at least five years. The results come against the backdrop of an escalating tussle between the co-founders of IndiGo and top two shareholders Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia over corporate governance issues and future strategy.

Airline Travel Insurance vs. Independent Travel Insurance: Which,"   SHOW MORE  Many or all of the products featured here are from our partners who compensate us. This may influence which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Note: The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted existing and future travel plans, and turned greater attention to trip insurance. Read our take on specific information concerning travel insurance and COVID-19, or see our comprehensive guide to managing your finances during COVID-19. You’ve planned your travel, found a flight, and can’t wait to book the trip on the airline’s website. But right before you hit the payment button, you have one seemingly simple question to answer: Do you want to add travel insurance? It’s a booking option that has stumped many a traveler. You may think you need it, but what does that airline insurance even cover? And would it be better to purchase separate travel insurance from an independent company instead? Here, we’ll help you break down that decision and figure out which one is right for you. For starters, every airline’s travel protection coverage is different. Some airlines, like Southwest, don’t offer any sort of trip protection for purchase with regular flights, but they do have an insurance option for Southwest Vacations. United, on the other hand, offers full travel insurance through a partnership with AIG, while British Airways offers protection with Allianz. So be aware that while you may purchase insurance through the airline, your policy is likely underwritten by a third-party insurer. Airlines offer a wide variety of travel insurance policies with varying benefits, so ensure you read the fine print to understand your specific coverage. Here are some examples: Trip cancellation or interruption, meaning you’ll get a refund of whatever you have paid (up to a certain amount) if you have to cancel or postpone your trip due to a covered reason. Reimbursement for lost or delayed baggage. Emergency medical coverage and/or assistance while traveling. And coverage isn’t the only thing that can vary; so does price. One airline might sell a policy for less than $15, while others may be more than five times that amount. This is another instance in which it’s critical to compare the details of what you’re actually getting. Here are two example policies we found for sale via United and","Oct 25, 2019",https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/airline-travel-insurance-vs-independent-travel-insurance-which-is-right-for-you
