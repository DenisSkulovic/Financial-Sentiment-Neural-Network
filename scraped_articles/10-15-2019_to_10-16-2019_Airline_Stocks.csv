3,United Airlines Vs American Airlines Stock: Which Is Best? - Financhill,. United Airlines Vs American Airlines Stock: Which Is Best?. United Airlines Burning Cash To Stay Alive. American Airlines $35M/Day,"United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) are two of the biggest airlines in the country. Both fell off the cliff during the stock market nosedive following the pandemic as global lockdown orders and travel restrictions halted regular life. The U.S. government stepped in with pandemic bailouts, but neither company fully recovered from the crash. This leaves a discounted investment opportunity for anyone willing to brave those dark skies. But which is the better investment between United Airlines stock vs American Airlines? Each must deal with different challenges while overcoming the same problem. Holiday travel is picking up, and there are strong social distancing guidelines in place that limited passenger capacity. Major business events and conferences went virtual, and it’s unclear when travel will fully return to normal. So what’s next for these former high fliers? United Airlines stock hit a cruising altitude between $80 and $100 per share before the coronavirus sent it crashing to $17.80. The airline’s approximately $10 billion market capitalization is less than half what it was before the pandemic travel restrictions shut down airports around the world. At $35 per share, UAL is a bargain for bullish investors who believe in the rebirth of the airline industry.  The company’s October earnings report undercut analyst estimates of -$7.63 earnings per share (EPS), losing -$8.16 per adjusted share. United’s $2.49 billion quarterly revenue was 78.1 percent lower than the same period in 2019 and not enough to offset its operating costs. This led to a $1.8 billion net loss for the third quarter. However, it’s not all doom and gloom, as air travel is reopened in time for the holiday season. Holiday travel is common around the country, and United hopes to capitalize by cutting its $25 million daily cash burn and bringing in passengers. Travel numbers are going up, but they’re still not where they were prior to the pandemic and quarantines. The government’s $5 billion coronavirus bailout ran out by October, and it could be several years before it climbs back to its previous trading price range. If United can’t stop its cash burn, it could be in trouble. American Airlines (AAL) also received a government bailout, to the tune of $5.8 billion from the CARES Act. It reached its highest trading point near $60 in early 2018 and was already on the downswing before the virus hit.

4,American Airlines Lifts Its Q3 Forecast | The Motley Fool,American Airlines Lifts Its Q3 Forecast. The airline is on track to report earnings in the upper half of its,"   American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) investors have endured lots of disappointment over the past several years. They have faced more of the same in 2019, with labor strife and the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX weighing heavily on the company's profitability. Whereas American Airlines entered the year expecting to produce adjusted earnings per share between $5.50 and $7.50, analysts now expect EPS to come in around the $5 mark. Fortunately, American Airlines did offer some good news in an investor update posted last week. The airline giant said that it expects its third-quarter pre-tax margin to reach the upper half of the guidance range it had provided in late July. This suggests that American finally may be close to stabilizing its business. Back in July, American Airlines projected that revenue per available seat mile (RASM) would rise 1% to 3% in the third quarter, roughly in line with the 2.1% RASM gain it achieved in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, the company said that adjusted nonfuel unit costs would rise 4% to 6% year over year, partly because it was forced to reduce its capacity growth due to the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. Lower fuel prices are offsetting some of this cost pressure. Factoring in all of those elements, American's initial forecast called for a Q3 pre-tax margin between 5.5% and 7.5%. For comparison, the carrier posted a 6% pre-tax margin in the prior-year period. Last Wednesday, American narrowed its revenue guidance range. It said that RASM rose 1.5% to 2.5% last quarter, despite the negative impact of Hurricane Dorian, which hit Florida on Labor Day weekend. The company left its nonfuel cost guidance intact and reduced its fuel cost estimate by $0.02 per gallon. As a result, American Airlines now expects its adjusted pre-tax margin to come in between 6.5% and 7.5% for the quarter. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. American Airlines had to cancel 9,475 flights last quarter, due to the grounding of its 24 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and the delayed delivery of the 16 additional 737 MAX jets it was supposed to receive in 2019. The company estimates that this reduced its pre-tax profit by about $140 million last quarter. This brings the running tally of the 737 MAX grounding's cost to $395 million. Additionally, the airline pushed back its estimate for the Boeing 737 MAX's return to service to Jan. 16,","Oct 16, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/16/american-airlines-lifts-its-q3-forecast.aspx
5,United Airlines Reports Another Excellent Quarter -- but Momentum Is Slowing | The Motley Fool,United Airlines Reports Another Excellent Quarter -- but Momentum Is Slowing. The airline giant's adjusted earnings per share soared by,"   United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) posted stellar earnings growth in the first half of 2019, as solid demand and lower fuel prices allowed the airline to expand its adjusted pre-tax margin to 8.6% from 6.5% a year earlier. As a result, adjusted earnings per share soared 45% year over year, to $5.32. On Tuesday afternoon, United Airlines reported that earnings continued to grow at a rapid rate in the third quarter, surpassing management's initial forecast for the quarter. The company also raised its full-year guidance. That said, there are growing signs that United's earnings momentum is starting to peter out. Entering the third quarter, United Airlines projected that passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) would increase 0.5% to 2.5% year over year, while adjusted nonfuel unit costs would rise 1% to 2%. Meanwhile, the company expected to pay between $2.12 and $2.22 per gallon for jet fuel, down from $2.32 per gallon a year earlier. Due primarily to this expected drop in fuel costs, United estimated that its pre-tax margin would widen to between 10% and 12% in the third quarter, up from 9.6% in Q3 2018. Ultimately, United's adjusted pre-tax margin reached 12.1% in the third quarter. As a result, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surpassed the average analyst estimate at $4.07 -- up 33% year over year -- on revenue of $11.4 billion. UNITED AIRLINES REPORTED ANOTHER QUARTER OF STELLAR EPS GROWTH ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. That said, United Airlines needed a sharp drop in fuel prices to achieve this earnings beat. PRASM rose 1.7% last quarter -- in line with United's forecast -- with strong performance in most regions of the world offsetting weakness in China. However, nonfuel unit costs rose slightly more than expected, increasing 2.1% year over year. Fortunately, United's average fuel price came in at $2.02 per gallon, $0.15 per gallon below the midpoint of its guidance range. This boosted its pre-tax margin by approximately 1.5 percentage points, driving about half of the company's earnings growth for the quarter. In conjunction with its Q3 earnings report, United Airlines raised its full-year earnings guidance. It now expects to produce adjusted EPS between $11.25 and $12.25 this year, compared to its previous forecast range of $10.50 to $12. However, for the fourth quarter specifically, the airline expects PRASM to grow just 0% to 2% year over year, while nonfuel unit costs","Oct 16, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/16/united-airlines-reports-another-excellent-quarter.aspx

Shania Twain references iconic song","In the past week, Delta Air Lines DAL initiated third-quarter 2019 earnings season for the airline space. The carrier delivered better-than-expected earnings while revenues lagged expectations. More than the revenue miss, it was the below-par fourth-quarter 2019 earnings per share guidance that disappointed investors. Consequently, this Atlanta, GA-based airline’s shares declined on Oct 10 despite the earnings beat. Like Delta, United Airlines Holdings UAL beat on earnings while it missed on the revenue front in the third quarter. However, shares of this Chicago-based carrier appreciated following its earnings outperformance on Oct 15 as well as the raised current-year earnings guidance. For 2019, the company now expects earnings between $11.25 and $12.25 compared with $10.5-$12 expected earlier. The mid-point of the newly guided range ($11.75 per share) is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.81. Following the bottom-line outperformance, the carrier’s CEO Oscar Munoz stated that the company was “ahead of pace’’ to achieve its earnings per share target (between $11 and $13) by 2020 end. Spirit Airlines SAVE was another major newsmaker over the past week. This low-cost carrier provided an encouraging guidance with respect to third-quarter 2019 unit revenues as the impact of Hurricane Dorian on forward bookings was not as severe as anticipated initially. The airline expects to release its detailed results for third-quarter 2019 on Oct 23. Furthermore, JetBlue Airways JBLU and Alaska Air Group ALK released the respective September traffic report over the past week. (Read the Last Airline Stock Roundup here). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Delta’s third-quarter 2019 earnings per share (excluding 1 cent from non-recurring items) of $2.32 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. The bottom line also improved 28.9% on a year-over-year basis, mainly owing to low fuel costs. However, operating revenues in the quarter under review came in at $12,560 million, marginally missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. But the top line increased year over year. Delta expects fourth-quarter earnings between $1.20 and $1.50 per share. (Read more: Delta Beats on Q3 Earnings, Stock Down on Dull Q4 View).

11,These 4 Measures Indicate That Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) Is Using Debt Extensively - Simply Wall St News,These 4 Measures Indicate That Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) Is Using Debt Extensively. Why Does Debt Bring Risk?. How Much Debt,"Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders? Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Spirit Airlines The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2019 Spirit Airlines had debt of US$2.20b, up from US$1.88b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$1.22b in cash leading to net debt of about US$984.2m. The latest balance sheet data shows that Spirit Airlines had liabilities of US$1.21b due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.36b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.22b as well as receivables valued at US$78.1m due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$3.27b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables. Given this deficit is actually higher than the company's market capitalization of US$2.45b, we think shareholders really should watch Spirit Airlines's debt levels, like a parent watching their child ride a bike for the first time. In the scenario where the company had to clean up its balance sheet quickly, it seems likely shareholders would suffer extensive dilution. We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or","Oct 15, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-save/spirit-airlines/news/these-4-measures-indicate-that-spirit-airlines-nysesave-is-using-debt-extensively
12,So you want to invest in the stock market: what will it cost?,"So you want to invest in the stock market: what will it cost?. Whatever way you choose to invest, you","    Getting your savings to grow has never been tougher. Bank deposit rates are on the floor and that means people are having to take on more risk than they might normally be comfortable with in search of return. That could mean trading foreign currencies, investing in bonds or taking a punt on the stock market. Whatever you choose, you will have to go through a broker – in person or online. In Ireland, there are a very small number of stockbroking firms. Merger, mishap and competition has seen the number of options for domestic investors reduce. And it could get worse. Davy, the largest player in the domestic market, is currently looking to acquire the next biggest broker, Goodbody, which is currently on the market. At the same time, a number of online brokers have entered the fray, offering extremely competitive rates. But how do you choose between one and the other, how much will they charge and what are the options for holding stocks or bonds? For brokers, the market is undoubtedly becoming more difficult, as the recent departure of industry stalwart Campbell O’Connor indicates. It blamed its decision to close down on the “ever-increasing complexity of doing business in a changing regulatory landscape, which does not favour smaller firms”. David Quinn, managing director of Investwise, only sees the situation getting worse. “I would say that it’s a concern that there is massive consolidation. We may only end up with two or three firms by the end of next year,” he said, mentioning that possible merger of Davy and Goodbody. “Internationally, the competition and downward pressure on fees is ferocious,” he explained, referencing the online operators. So what are the ever fewer number of stockbrokers offering by way of products? Customers can choose first to have either a discretionary account – where the broker makes investment decisions on their behalf – or an advisory account – where the broker advises them on what stocks to buy or sell, but the customer makes the decision. Then there is the ever more popular option of the execution-only account, where the broker simply buys or sells shares that you have chosen yourself without offering advice. How much you pay for the service will depend on which approach you choose. And that will largely be determined by how confident you are with stock investments.

IN JUST 5 MINUTES.
EVERY SATURDAY MORNING.  Widely recognized investor predicted the top tech stock on the S&P 500
In the last three of four years... See his next prediction here! Sponsored While technical warning signs for the stock market have taken something of a backseat to the daily parade of geopolitical headlines, concerns about market breadth have been bubbling under the surface for some time now. The percentage of S&P 500 Index (SPX) stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages has rebounded from recent lows, but remained south of the 50% threshold as of Friday afternoon. In fact, about a month ago, this indicator's own 50-day moving average completed a bearish cross with its 200-day counterpart for the first time since October 2018. Similarly, the number of New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) securities hitting new 52-week highs has dwindled to around 143 -- down sharply from highs of 576 around early July. So, even as major equity indexes trade within striking distance of new record peaks, the underlying worry is that the weight of the rally is being shouldered by an increasingly slim number of equities, and may subsequently be on its ""last legs."" With that context in mind, our focus this week is on the percentage of Nasdaq stocks trading above their 200-day moving averages -- a somewhat broader and more generous version of the S&P 50-day metric mentioned above. After a quick surge up to 55% recently, this metric has cratered all the way down to the upper 30s, with the majority of Nasdaq-listed names now trading on the south side of their 200-day moving averages. And, as with the S&P indicator mentioned above, the percentage of Nasdaq stocks trading above their 200-day moving average has now broken below its own 200-day moving average, which hasn't happened since the late-May/early June lows. Furthermore, after tumbling below this trendline, the indicator was subsequently rejected at its 200-day moving average, and jolted lower again. The break of the 200-day moving average here isn't necessarily devastating for the Nasdaq; in fact, this indicator has repeatedly bottomed in 2019 around the 35% neighborhood, which just happens to be a few notches below both its current level and the 200-day trendline. Previously, during the fourth-quarter 2018 sell-off, the 35% level is where this indicator found resistance on a couple of occasions before bottoming out.

Aviation authorities forced airlines to take the Boeing 737 Max aircraft BA, -0.67%  out of service earlier this year after the plane was implicated in two separate disasters. Issues with the aircraft’s software likely contributed to the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which resulted in the deaths of 346 people. Some analysts have suggested that the aircraft may never resume service. (Boeing did not immediately return a request for comment.) Many airlines that include the 737 Max aircraft in their fleet have opted to remove the planes from their schedules through to the early weeks of 2020. As a result, airlines have had to re-book passengers on other flights and cancel some planned trips entirely. ‘The odds that fares will come down around popular holiday travel dates are even slimmer this year.’ Most people will be aiming to travel on just a handful of dates during the holiday season. “They’re left operating at reduced capacity and, with seat supply diminished at a time when demand is highest, fares will go up,” said Tracy Stewart, content editor at airfare deal site Airfarewatchdog.com.

Previously, Southwest Airlines LUV, -0.78%  said it was pulling Max flights from its schedule through Jan. 5, 2020. “The limited number of customers who have already booked their travel and will be affected by our amended schedule will be proactively notified of their re-accommodated travel plans, according to our flexible accommodation procedures,” the airline said. United Airlines UAL, -2.48%, meanwhile, has only pulled Max flights from its schedule through Dec. 19. “During this period, we’ll continue to take extraordinary steps to protect our customers’ travel plans,” the airline said. “Moving forward, we’ll continue to monitor the regulatory process and nimbly make the necessary adjustments to our operation and our schedule to benefit our customers who are traveling with us.” United previously said","Oct 15, 2019",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeing-737-max-grounding-puts-pressure-on-airlines-to-raise-prices-this-holiday-season-2019-10-11

17,Dow's 4th-Largest Stock Surges on Earnings Surprise,Dow’s 4th-Largest Stock Surges on Earnings Surprise. UnitedHealth to grow by ‘conservative’ double digits. Dow boosted by analyst-beating UNH earnings.,"By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH), the Dow’s fourth most heavily weighted component, shot up after the healthcare giant beat Wall Street’s current growth estimates. On Tuesday, the stock rose from Monday’s closing price of $222.07 to $239.84, a jump of 8%. The Dow 30 member has since pared some of the gains to trade at $238.20. The Minnetonka, Minnesota-based health giant disclosed in its third-quarter results that its 2019 earnings growth would come in between 13% and 16%. This was against Wall Street estimates of 11%. Full-year adjusted earnings forecasts are now expected to range between $14.90 and $15 per share. Previously, earnings had been estimated to come in between $14.70 and $14.90. Despite beating estimates, CEO David Wichmann still called the projections “conservative.” For the third quarter, UnitedHealth also posted numbers that beat Wall Street revenue projections. Revenues grew by 6.7% year-on-year or by $3.8 billion to reach $60.4 billion. This was the third consecutive quarter that the healthcare giant exceeded analyst expectations. And despite heading into the 2020 election with a stable of Democratic presidential candidates whose agendas could upend the private healthcare market, Wichmann gave assurances that UnitedHealth had the capacity to weather difficult operating environments. “We have a strong track record of thriving in fluid environments, similar to the one we find ourselves in today,” Wichmann said. “We are uniquely diverse with significant experience and weight in every aspect of health care.” Perhaps in an effort to preempt a radical shift in the US healthcare delivery system, the CEO of the company’s UnitedHealthcare division, Dirk McMahon, argued that increased access would be driven by lowering costs. In April, Wichmann warned that plans by Democrats to provide socialized medicine would “destabilize the nation’s health system.” Despite the optimism, UnitedHealth Group stock still trades well below its all-time high, and it’s also currently nearly 12% below the 2019 high it set in July. Nevertheless, UnitedHealth’s stellar earnings and projections helped launch the Dow Jones Industrial Average to gains of around 300 points. Other stocks that contributed to the upside alongside UnitedHealth include JPMorgan Chase, which rose by around 4%. Intel, Caterpillar, and Johnson & Johnson also boosted the index.
