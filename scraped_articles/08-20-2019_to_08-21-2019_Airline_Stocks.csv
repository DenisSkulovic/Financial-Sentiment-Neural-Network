0,Why Airline Stocks Are Underperforming the US Market,Why Airline Stocks Are Underperforming the US Market. External factors affecting Airline stocks. Internal factors,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO The year so far hasn’t gone well for airline stocks, as the majority have underperformed the broader markets. The US Global Jets ETF (JETS) is up just 1.2% YTD (year-to-date). The ETF invests in passenger and cargo airlines, airplane makers, and airport and terminal services companies. Its YTD return is significantly lower than the gains of major US indexes. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq are up 11.3%, 15.7%, and 19.8%, respectively, YTD. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) is the worst performer among major US air carriers. The stock has lost 33.4% of its value in the year so far. American Airlines (AAL), Hawaiian Holdings (HA), and Alaska Air Group (ALK) stocks have fallen 19.6%, 3.7%, and 1.2%, respectively. Nonetheless, Delta Air (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), and United Airlines (UAL) are the three carriers that have outperformed their peers. Shares of Delta and Southwest are up 15.6% and 7.6%, respectively, YTD. United Airlines stock has also managed to be in the positive with a YTD return of 0.4%. Several external and company-specific factors are responsible for the underperformance of the airline industry. Among the macroeconomic issues, uncertainty over US-China trade negotiations and global slowdown concerns have kept the entire broader market highly volatile this year. Weakened trade ties and economic slowdown don’t affect the airline industry directly. Instead, they have a long-term impact. Sluggish economic growth and tidy trade relations could lead to a gradual decline in business travelers’ traffic in the long run. An economic slowdown will negatively affect the job market, thereby preventing people from making vacation plans. Severe winter conditions and a partial government shutdown also hampered the operations of several airlines at the start of 2019. In an April 9 regulatory filing, American Airlines reported over 1,000 flight cancellations in the first quarter due to the partial US government shutdown in January. In a March 27 regulatory filing, Southwest revealed that it had recorded over 3,800 flight cancelations during the first quarter due to unfavorable weather conditions. Moreover, the government shutdown in January caused Southwest to delay its Hawaiian Islands expansion plan. All these external factors made investors susceptible to the airline industry’s near-term growth prospects. Most airlines remain saddled with several other company-specific issues. Excluding Delta, the top three US airlines are facing massive flight cancellations due to the worldwide grounding of Boeing’s (BA) 737 MAX planes.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   In the past week, Latin American carrier — LATAM Airlines LTM — reported a narrower-than-expected loss for second-quarter 2019. The quarterly loss also decreased on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by an uptick in passenger revenues, a decline in non-fuel unit costs and favorable foreign currency movements. On the non-earnings front, Delta Air Lines DAL grabbed headlines by virtue of the decision to bolster its 2020 capacity by 15% year over year between the UK and its coastal hubs in Boston and New York-JFK. Also, Delta’s partner Virgin Atlantic will introduce additional flights. Meanwhile, United Airlines UAL announced its decision to introduce flights connecting four of its U.S. hubs and Tokyo's Haneda International Airport from Mar 28, 2020.   An expansion-related update was also available from Southwest Airlines LUV, when it announced the decision to start operating additional flights to the Hawaiian Islands beginning next January. Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group’s ALK posted impressive July traffic numbers owing to robust demand for air travel. (Read the Last Airline Stock Roundup here). Recap of Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. LATAM Airlines’ second-quarter 2019 loss of 10 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 19 cents a year ago. Total revenues increased year over year to $2,288.9 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,376.2 million. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a 3.2% rise in passenger revenues, which accounted for 85.2% of the top line. During the quarter, more than 16.8 million passengers (up 8.3%) opted to fly with LATAM Airlines and its subsidiaries. The uptick can be attributed to strong performances at the carrier’s domestic markets. Cargo revenues, however, declined 10.2% in the quarter. Operating expenses increased 1.1% year over year. Moreover, fuel costs increased 5.2% owing to a 6.7% rise in fuel consumption. Excluding fuel costs, cost per available seat mile (CASK) declined 5.2% due to the company’s cost-reduction efforts. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 1.1 percentage points to 83.3% as consolidated traffic growth (7.1%)","Aug 20, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-stock-roundup-ltms-q2-143502941.html

3,Southwest Airlines Stock Is Merely Waiting for its Hawaiian Excursion | InvestorPlace,"Southwest Airlines Stock May Soon Chart a Golden Route. While the Max 8 grounding disproportionately hurt LUV stock, a return"," Although discount airliner Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is up nearly 11% year-to-date, this is a name that peaked too soon. At the beginning of February, the LUV stock price had gained 24% from January’s opening volley. However, shares spent much of the year mired in a bearish trend channel since then.   Of course, investors aren’t terribly surprised at the underperformance of Southwest Airlines stock. For starters, the U.S.-China trade war has weighed heavily on the markets. And though the ratcheting up of trade tensions don’t directly affect the airline, they do cloud consumer sentiment. Unfortunately, that does take a bite out of the broader transportation industry. Secondly, Southwest Airlines delivered a mixed earnings report for the second quarter of 2019. While the company delivered a beat on per-share profitability, it came up short on revenue. Against a consensus estimate of $5.93 billion, the airline rang up just under $5.91 billion. Wall Street didn’t care for the sales miss and the LUV stock price fell sharply after the disclosure. Adding to the woes was the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max 8 jetliner. After two fatal accidents involving the popular plane, a harsh spotlight glared on the once-respected company. At fault was a stabilization system that required grounding all Max 8 jets for inspection and repair. Boeing’s woes are particularly troublesome for Southwest Airlines stock because the underlying company is the world’s biggest operator of the Max 8, with 34 in its fleet of about 750 planes. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Air Canada (OTCMKTS:ACDVF) are tied for second place at 24 planes. With such dependency on a disgraced jetliner, does LUV stock offer a realistic chance to break out of its rut? I understand investors’ hesitation with Southwest Airlines stock. Not only is it heavily levered to the 737 Max 8, other airliners have outpaced it. For example, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) dealt with the same economic and geopolitical headwinds, yet its shares are up 20% YTD. In addition, trade tensions and other macro-headwinds have brought about fears of a wider correction or even a major tumble. Certainly, the present environment doesn’t inspire a risk on attitude. That said, I believe LUV stock offers a rational bull argument for the risk-tolerant speculator. Amid the mixed Q2 earnings report, management delivered a less ambiguous piece of good news: a resumption of their Hawaiian route expansion strategy.

4,6 electric aviation companies to watch | Greenbiz,6 electric aviation companies to watch. 1. Eviation . 2. magniX. 3. Pipistrel. 4. Ampaire. 5. Bye Aerospace. 6. Zunum,"By Shane Downing August 20, 2019 Although big-name organizations such as Boeing, JetBlue and NASA are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into electric aviation research and development, you won’t be able to fly across the United States on an all-electric commercial jumbo jet anytime soon. That technology is decades away, and while the number of electric aircraft programs in progress around the world could hit 200 by the end of the year, only a couple of small, short-range electric aircraft designs have taken to the skies. As more companies prepare to test prototypes by the end of 2019, three big hurdles remain: improving new technologies; navigating a lengthy and expensive certification process; and attracting (and maintaining good relationships with) deep-pocketed investors. And then there’s the obvious challenge of convincing fliers — frequent and infrequent — to embrace electric planes as ticket-purchasing passengers.  Although a day when travelers can crisscross the world in all-electric commercial jets may seem a lifetime away, roughly 45 percent of global flights are under 500 miles, putting almost half of all flights within the range of an electric motor. In a place such as the United States, where the aviation industry contributes 12 percent of all carbon emissions, that’s a big opportunity to reduce emissions. As the regional, ""middle-mile"" electric aviation industry continues to pick up speed, there are plenty of near-term opportunities for airports and airline companies to move the needle on the industry’s sustainability efforts. Whether eliminating single-use plastics, investing in renewable energy or switching to all-electric on-the-ground fleet vehicles, green airports have a better chance of getting off the ground well before large-scale electric commercial aviation gets some serious wind beneath its wings. In the meantime, here are six electric aviation companies to watch in the next 12 months.   Israeli startup Eviation stole the show at the 53rd International Paris Air Show in June, when it unveiled its battery-powered, all-electric nine-seater aircraft. The first-of-its-kind zero-emission plane, Alice, was built with regional aviation in mind. On a single charge, Alice can fly 650 miles at 10,000 feet with a cruising speed of 276 miles per hour. The estimated per-hour operating cost of Alice is $165, or roughly 7 cents per available seat mile. Even though the planes will be built from 95 percent lightweight composite materials, Eviation’s CEO, Omer Bar-Yohay, has described Alice as a ""huge battery with some plane","Aug 20, 2019",https://www.greenbiz.com/article/6-electric-aviation-companies-watch

Download our mobile,"Ryanair shares dipped slightly after its success in blocking a 48-hour strike by its Dublin-based pilots was followed by the British High Court giving the green-light for a potentially more damaging UK pilot strike. Ryanair shares dipped slightly after its success in blocking a 48-hour strike by its Dublin-based pilots was followed by the British High Court giving the green-light for a potentially more damaging UK pilot strike. Ryanair shares - already down around 20% since the turn of the year - initially rose as much as 2% on the Irish High Court ruling blocking this week's planned strike action of Irish-based pilots. However, they closed down just over 1% after the airline failed in a legal bid to prevent a strike by pilots in its biggest market of the UK. Britain's High Court refused to block the walkout, dismissing a request for a last-minute injunction against the action. The two-day walkout threatens services at London Stansted, Ryanair's largest hub. Airline stocks have had a turbulent year. Ryanair's share price has fallen by over 36% in the past 12 months; UK rival EasyJet's by 39% and Aer Lingus and British Airways-owner IAG's by 33%. Lufthansa has lost more than 40% of its share value in that time, with only Air France-KLM seeing an increase. One analyst said while issues with trade unions are never helpful to investor sentiment, the actual final impact on flights and passenger movement is a more accurate barometer than the basic threat of industrial action. Brexit is still outweighing strike threats as the main concern for airline investors, they said. Ryanair has been battling the threat of strike action in Ireland, Britain, Portugal and Spain of late. Spanish cabin crew are threatening to strike in September, while their Portuguese counterparts have begun a five-day strike over holiday pay. Ryanair said only a small number of fights from its Portuguese bases might be affected by minor schedule changes and that affected customers had been notified. No delays or cancellations have been reported at Ryanair's bases at Lisbon, Oporto and Faro. Ryanair said the UK strike only affects a minority of pilots and has pledged to operate a full schedule. Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said cancellations could be limited, though the airline may also suffer a longer-term impact on bookings. -additional reporting Bloomberg and Reuters MORE COURTS ARTICLES MORE IN THIS SECTION Our Covid-free newsletter brings together some","Aug 21, 2019",https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-30945382.html
6,Why Hawaiian Holdings Stock Dropped 5% Today | The Motley Fool,Why Hawaiian Holdings Stock Dropped 5% Today. Competition from Southwest is becoming a bigger issue for Hawaii's homegrown air carrier..,"   Shares of Hawaiian Airlines operator Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) dropped as much as 10% in reaction to a negative report out of investment bank Stifel this morning. That's the bad news. The good news is that the shares recovered somewhat in a generally ebullient stock market and ended the day down only 5.2%. IMAGE SOURCE: HAWAIIAN AIR. So what did Stifel have to say that so spooked investors? In a ""double downgrade,"" the analyst flipped all the way from buy to sell, citing ""a disconnect between PRASM [Passenger Revenue per Available Seat Mile]/EPS [earnings per share] expectations for HA into 2020."" Turns out, competitor Southwest's (NYSE:LUV) entry into the Hawaiian market, which was announced back in March, is turning into an even bigger problem for Hawaiian than originally anticipated. Last week, Southwest announced that in January 2020, it will be expanding its service flying from the mainland to the airports in both Lihue and Kona and start offering daily inter-island flights among Honolulu, Lihue, Hilo, Kona, and Kahului.  In total, Southwest says it will operate 18 flights between Hawaii and the continental U.S. and 34 inter-island flights daily. Stifel says the market took this news as ""neutral"" to Hawaiian Holdings -- indeed, Hawaiian stock actually rose in the days following Southwest's announcement. But in Stifel's view, it's a big negative for Hawaiian stock. Additionally, the analyst warned that ""U.S.-to-Hawaii PRASM trends are nearing an inflection point based on the historical relationship between Continental U.S.-to Hawaii PRASM and Continental U.S.-to-Continental U.S. PRASM."" What this basically just means is that Stifel thinks prices are going to fall -- and Hawaiian Holdings' profits along with them.

News,"Stocks are in limbo. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for the first time in four days on Tuesday as the market digested its recent swings, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also ticking lower. The move leaves investors and experts broadly uncertain about what’s next for global markets, with key Federal Reserve announcements set for this week and U.S.-China trade talks still ahead. Here’s what four market pros are watching: Jeff Saut, market strategist at Capital Wealth Planning, didn’t let last week’s volatility shake his bullish outlook: “I think we’re in the sixth inning. I think this market, the secular bull market that we’re in, … has years left to run, and I think that you should be pretty much fully invested here. It was about three weeks ago … that I said, ‘The market bottomed yesterday,’ and that was Aug. 5, with a 90% downside day, meaning 90% of the total volume traded came in on the downside. Since then, you’ve had another 90% downside day on Aug.14, and you’ve had two almost 90% upside days. That … is the way bottoms are made, so we think the lows are in. The market might be a little bit ahead of itself on a very short-term trading basis, but, again, I think the market’s going substantially higher.” Michael Tyler, Eastern Bank Wealth Management’s chief investment officer, was more inclined to wait for the outcome of U.S.-China trade discussions: “The interesting thing is that earnings are beginning to come in a little bit soft and we do have some signs that, if the next round of tariffs is implemented, a little in September and perhaps more in December depending on how the politics goes, that could really, meaningfully impact the consumer. Home Depot gave us a tiny touch of that this morning. And, if so, then we’ve got some real vulnerability, because the consumer has been the driving force for so long, and if that weakens, if consumers weaken, then we could have a fundamental problem. But for right now, rising valuations on low interest rates, even if earnings are a bit soft, I’d say Jeff is right: The market’s probably got a little bit more, at least a little bit more, to go this year.” Former Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota warned of a debilitating “fear factor” weighing on global markets: “I think the concern that you see","Aug 20, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/20/dow-drops-for-first-time-in-4-dayswhat-experts-see-ahead-for-markets.html
9,Why is Norwegian Air failing? — Quartz,Why Norwegian Air is failing. An airtight strategy?. Bad luck and Boeing. Holding out for a hero. RECOMMENDED STORIES,"   Reporter In his 2018 end-of-year letter to Norwegian Air shareholders, co-founder and then-CEO Bjørn Kjos made some bold predictions for his low-cost, long-haul airline. “This past year has marked a peak in the company’s growth,” he wrote. “We are now entering a new phase where there will be a clear return from our investments. The key priority for the entire organization is returning to profitability.” Eight months on, that “new phase” looks more remote than ever. Since the start of 2019, the airline has hit a near-constant spell of turbulence, including the surprise resignation of its CEO, the axing of key transatlantic routes, and multiple analyst downgrades. Norwegian’s rapid expansion since 2013 has stalled, while costs are piling up. With the company’s share price now down more than 75% from a year earlier, shareholders may be eyeing up the emergency exits. What went so wrong for the carrier—and is there any blue sky to be found? It is exceptionally difficult for low-cost carriers to be profitable. Between 1992 and 2012, more than 40 budget airlines launched in Europe—within a decade, all but 10 had failed. Short-haul carriers that have succeeded, such as easyJet and Ryanair, do so by keeping their planes in the air as much as they possibly can. Legacy carriers such as British Airways might get nine “block hours” a day from their aircraft. Successful low-cost competitors may squeeze out as many as 11. The flight-after-flight model simply doesn’t work for long haul operations: Norwegian’s plane usage, according to analyst firm Bernstein, is comparable to British Airways. Then, of course, there’s the simple fact that passengers aren’t always convinced of the value of sacrificing comfort for eight hours at a time. In January 2019, for instance, Ryanair managed to sell more than 90% of its tickets; Norwegian limped behind, with only three-quarters of its seats filled. Around the world, long-haul, low-cost airlines are barely getting by. In May, AirAsia X made a narrow return to profitability after a year of losses. To lift Eurowings out of the red, parent Lufthansa was forced to slash many of its long-haul routes. And in March, Iceland-based WoW air was forced to hang up its flying goggles for good after being declared bankrupt. Late last month, Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary predicted “more failures” in the low-cost sector by the end of the year.

13,More than Half of All Stock Buybacks are Now Financed by Debt. Here's Why That's a Problem | Fortune,More than Half of All Stock Buybacks are Now Financed by Debt. Here’s Why That’s a Problem. Why debt dominates.,"August 20, 2019 7:25 PM GMT+3         The era of cheap borrowing is fostering corporate America’s favorite investor-pleasing activity: Share buybacks. Indeed, more than half of all buybacks are now funded by debt. And while there's an argument that repurchases benefit share prices and investors, at least in the short run, it's questionable whether highly indebted companies should be doing this. Sort of like mortaging your house to the hilt, then using it to throw a lavish party.  Borrowing oodles of money to buy back shares at the end of an economic cycle, when share prices are near record highs, may seem especially dubious for highly indebted companies like AT&T and American Airlines. Buybacks per se are not inherently wrong-headed, wrote RIA Advisors Chief Investment Strategist Lance Roberts on the Seeking Alpha site, but ""when they are coupled with accounting gimmicks and massive levels of debt to fund them ... they become problematic."" Lower interest rates have been a big catalyst for buybacks for years, and further rate reductions can only fuel companies’ urge to gather in even more shares. The Federal Reserve last month decreased its benchmark for short-term rates by a quarter percentage point, and futures markets expect at least two more reductions in 2019. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which calls the tune for long-term corporate bonds, yields 1.59% annually, half of what it was last November. Disturbingly, companies are channeling more cash to investors than they are producing in free cash flow, the first time that has occurred since the Great Recession, according to Goldman Sachs. ""Unless earnings growth accelerates materially, companies will likely continue to fund spending by drawing down cash balances and increasing leverage,""  wrote David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. strategist, in a note to clients. Buybacks are a strong catalyst for the bull market. In fact, they are a more significant factor than economic growth, a study last year in the Financial Analysts Journal concluded. The research covered 43 nations over two decades. Buybacks last year hit a record in the U.S., reaching $806.4 billion for the S&P 500, besting the previous high point of $589.1 billion in 2007, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Goldman expects them to finish near $1 trillion in 2019. In this year’s first quarter, S&P 500 companies, which cover 80% of U.S. market valuation, bought back $205.1 billion,","Aug 20, 2019",https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/stock-buybacks-debt-financed/
14,How Risky Is Your Investment?,How Risky Is Your Investment?. Understanding The Types Of Risk In Finance. Standard Deviation. Semi-Deviation. Beta. Analysing Risk Using Risk-Adjusted,"                                        To many of us, the word “risk” has a negative connotation. We would much rather take less risky decisions than to take riskier ones and bear the chance of large negative consequences.  However, I would like to propose that risky situations provide opportunities as well. The Chinese characters for risk, “Wei Ji”, illustrates this connotation well. The character on the left, “Wei”, represents danger, while the character on the right, “Ji”, represents an opportunity. The juxtaposition of these two characters, tell us that danger and opportunity are always present in risky situations.  In finance and investing, we are faced with the same prospects too. The key is to navigate the investing landscape with both dangers and opportunities in mind.  Disclaimer: Opinions expressed in the article should not be taken as investment advice. Please do your own due diligence. In investing, there are different types of risk that we should take into account. Here, I will just share about 3 different forms of risk. For the treatment of other kinds of risks such as foreign exchange risk, default risk, etc, you can always visit our Seedly Q&A to ask your questions and learn more. The standard deviation of a stock’s returns represents the Chinese concept of “risk” well. Standard deviation measures the deviation of a stock’s returns from its expected returns.  In this case, if a stock performs well in the market above its expected or historical mean, the standard deviation of the stock increases. Hence, there is greater opportunity for investors to benefit from the above-expected results. Of course, “danger” also lies in the sense that the performance of the stock can be much worse than what is expected.  For many investors, the risk that they are concerned about is downside risk or the risk that a security can suffer a decline in value if market conditions change.  Unlike standard deviation, this measure of risk ignores volatility which leads to positive results, and only focuses on volatility that leads to negative results. The formula for Semi-Deviation is similar to that of Standard Deviation, but it uses a form of return threshold instead.

17,South Korea’s activist fund KCGI mulls Asiana Airlines takeover,"South Korea’s activist fund KCGI mulls Asiana Airlines takeover. Battle for control. World needs more freighters, can Boeing produce more","South Korea’s two largest carriers with, lately, not so shiny of a reputation, may now be joining forces. Activist fund KCGI, the no. 2 shareholder in parent company of national carrier Korean Air Lines, is reportedly considering taking over rival Asiana Airlines, local media sources indicate. KCGI (Korea Corporate Governance Improvement) CEO Kang Sung-boo has been cited by multiple sources as saying that the private equity fund ""received an Information Memorandum (IM) from Asiana Airlines and is reviewing its options"" for the potential acquisition of the carrier, The Korea Times reports. Asiana Airlines is majority owned by Kumho Asiana Group, one of South Korea’s largest conglomerates, which aims to sell its controlling 31% stake in the carrier. The airline’s holding company, Kumho Industrial, announced the decision on July 25, 2019. And it is not only Asiana Airlines that is ‘at stake’ here. Two of its budget subsidiaries – Air Seoul, which is wholly owned by the airline, and Air Busan, where Asiana has a minority stake (46%), are also included in the sale, as Korea Joongang Daily points out. Several domestic conglomerates have expressed interest in Asiana Airlines, but none have yet confirmed their intentions. KCGI is currently holding talks with local and overseas companies in order to form a consortium and join the bidding for Asiana Airlines, Reuters writes. Asiana expects to receive initial bids from prospective buyers in September 2019 with the main bidding to proceed in October 2019. KCGI is the second-largest shareholder of parent of Korean Air, Hanjin Group. Through its subsidiary Grace Holdings, the hedge fund owns a 15.98% stake in the Group’s holding company, Hanjin KAL. Why meddle with Asiana Airlines? First is the finances: aside of the debt-ridden Asiana, national carrier Korean Air also posted an operating loss for the second quarter of 2019 (April-June), compared to a year earlier. Korean Air reported an operating loss of $81.6 million in Q2, from an operating profit of $55.2 million from the previous year. The company recorded a net loss of $315.3 million in the second quarter 2019, The Korea Herald informs.  As for Asiana Airlines, earlier in March 2019, the carrier failed to obtain auditors’ signature on their annual financial report. Consequently, the trading of the airline's stocks were suspended from March 22 to 26, 2019. Two South Korean credit rating agencies threatened to downgrade its credit ratings. Later the company revised its","Aug 20, 2019",https://www.aerotime.aero/23839-south-korea-s-activist-fund-kcgi-mulls-asiana-airlines-takeover
