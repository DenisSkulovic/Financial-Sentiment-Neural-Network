2,3 Aerospace Stocks to Buy Right Now | The Motley Fool,"3 Aerospace Stocks to Buy Right Now. Air travel is down, but there are still opportunities in aerospace stocks.. Upending","   Aerospace may not seem like a great place for investors right now, given the virtual shutdown of most airline travel. But there are parts of the industry that will survive -- and even thrive -- in the long term.  If we think beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, I think Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE), Heico Corp (NYSE:HEI), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) have what it takes to survive this economic slump and come out healthy on the other side.  IMAGE SOURCE: VIRGIN GALACTIC. One aerospace company whose revenue hasn't been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic is Virgin Galactic -- and that's only because it had very little revenue to begin with. In 2019, the company had just $3.8 million in revenue as it invested in building and testing its spacecraft.  Virgin Galactic isn't being affected in the short term, and I don't think the company's long-term prospects have changed since COVID-19 began to spread. The company is still targeting commercial travel for multimillionaires and has received 7,957 reservations of interest as of Feb. 23, 2020.  What's appealing about Virgin Galactic is that its goal is to disrupt travel as we know it. A two-hour flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo, or a one-hour flight from New York to London are both possible with the company's spacecraft flying at Mach 5. Right now, given their $250,000 price tags, those tickets are only affordable for the ultrawealthy, but if ticket prices become affordable enough for (mere) millionaires, the business could disrupt the $900 billion commercial aviation market. And that's a disruptive business I want to be a part of for the long term.  Heico doesn't get the publicity of a growth stock like Virgin Galactic, but it's a critical supplier to the aviation industry and highly profitable for its investors. The company's flight support business makes replacement parts for aircraft, and its electronic technologies business make subcomponents and subsystems for aviation, defense, medical, and more.  Through a series of acquisitions and operational improvements, the company has nearly quadrupled its revenue in the past decade and seen net income jump nearly 700%.   HEI REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS. Heico's management has a long history of generating strong returns for investors, and I think that will continue once the COVID-19 pandemic passes.

4,Air Canada (TSX:AC): A Buy at $17? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Air Canada (TSX:AC): A Buy at $17?. Air Canada stock’s tailspin may,"      Joey Frenette | April 18, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) stock has been in focus ever since the coronavirus sent the airlines into a tailspin. Back in January, I’d urged investors to jump out of the stock while it was near its all-time highs, citing valuation concerns and the risk of the coronavirus, which I didn’t think was fully factored into the share price at the time. As it turned out, those who followed my recommendation saved themselves from a world of pain, as Air Canada stock proceeded to crash over 75% from peak to trough, as the negative headlines started rolling in. Even after Air Canada stock got slashed in half twice, investors shouldn’t expect the name not to get halved again, especially given the unprecedented revenue decline that’s to be expected for the coming quarter and the fact that the stock isn’t even at a three-year low yet! While most other stocks have bounced back (most stocks have recovered half the ground lost in the coronavirus crash, with some fully recovering), the most affected industries, including the airlines, have barely budged compared to the scale of their unprecedented declines from the top. To make matters worse, Warren Buffett’s recent airline share sales sent jitters down the spines of those investors who blindly followed the man into airline stocks. The charts of the airline stocks seem to imply that a bottom has formed and that it’s now safe to get back aboard the beaten-up airline stocks given the economy may be on the cusp of re-opening. However, Foolish investors should maintain cautious optimism and dollar-cost-average to build a position in the airlines. It’s easy to let greed take control of your investment decisions when everybody is trying to chase that elusive bottom, blowing every tiny news event out of proportion. I see the stock as tremendously undervalued at 1.1 times book, but beginner investors need to brace for turbulence, as the stock has suddenly become a trader’s playground. Even though you have the intention of holding for years or decades at a time, you should resist the urge to “chase” after +10% runs in airline stocks after any tiny bits of positive news. The magnitude of volatility in Air Canada stock is off the charts, and you should expect more of the same over the coming weeks and months, as","Apr 18, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/18/air-canada-tsxac-a-buy-at-17/
5,Stock Market Investors Are Too Optimistic - The Washington Post,Stock Market Investors Are Too Optimistic. Today’s Headlines. ,"There has been a V-shaped recovery; in the stock market, not in the economy. That is dividing opinion between the doomsayers who think this divergence makes no sense, and those who believe that the Federal Reserve and its central bank peers have this covered — and that they’ll restore the economy to its former state. That doyen of bargain hunters, Warren Buffett, has been conspicuous by his absence from the recent spate of share buying. Notably, he’s been a net seller of airline stocks. The S&P 500 lost one-third of its value between its record high on Feb. 19 and March 23. It has clawed back half of that as the Fed chucked out its rule book and went on a shopping spree for assets. Equities are pretty much the only type of security that it won’t be adding to its ballooning balance sheet, although a fresh bout of market mayhem might change that too. America’s central bank is already snapping up exchange-traded funds and junk bonds, after all. A 27% recovery in equities is surprising given that we still have no idea of the virus’s lasting impact on economic output, with only a very partial return to business activity planned and no vaccine in sight. The surge in jobless claims and companies furloughing staff makes forecasting more art than science, much like Covid-19 statistics. As Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank AG’s chief economist, points out, a decade of U.S. employment gains have been reversed in a month. The International Monetary Fund’s global economic predictions this week signaled the bleakest times since the 1930s. The monetary and fiscal response has been spectacular but can it prevent a permanent loss of growth if people’s consumption, travel and working practices have been altered fundamentally? A wave of defaults, credit downgrades into junk territory, bankruptcies and price drops in real assets such as aircraft and property would change the more positive stock market narrative quickly, as would a second wave of the virus. Parts of the world, Europe in particular, were at risk of recession before the outbreak. Crude oil prices below $20 per barrel don’t suggest global demand will come roaring back. The equity market is meant to reflect anticipated corporate earnings, and although it’s often given to wild optimism, this is an entirely new situation. How can anyone say with a straight face that they can estimate future earnings right now? There’s","Apr 19, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/stock-market-investors-are-too-optimistic/2020/04/17/2b5cd38c-8079-11ea-84c2-0792d8591911_story.html

Warren Buffett's financial crisis bailouts inspired the US government's 'big 4' airline rescue deals, Sen. Jack Reed says. SHARE","   AP Photo/Nati Harnik  Warren Buffett's corporate bailouts during the financial crisis inspired a key aspect of the US government's rescue deals with the ""big four"" airlines this week. The famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway boss handed billions to Goldman Sachs and General Electric in 2008, and Bank of America in 2011. His terms included warrants allowing him to buy their shares at a fixed price in the future. Buffett exercised the warrants years later after the companies' stock prices rebounded, raking in big profits.  Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told Business Insider that Buffett's dealmaking ""absolutely"" spurred him to write a warrant provision for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in response to the financial crisis, ""so that taxpayers might be able to profit should the firms flourish after selling their bad debts to the government."" Read more: A 47-year market vet explains why he sees the economy's 'super-cycle' hurtling towards depression — and lays out his case for an 80% stock plunge later this year Sen. Chuck Schumer highlighted Reed's proposal during the Senate debates on the bailout package in September 2008. He also pointed to one of Buffett's deals to justify the government seeking equity in return for aid. ""This morning, Warren Buffett got an equity share in Goldman Sachs and it didn't stop Goldman Sachs from making the deal with Warren Buffett,"" Schumer said. ""It seems only fair that we reward taxpayers, if, as we hope, this plan succeeds,"" he added.  Reed told Business Insider that the warrants generated a $10 billion profit for the US Treasury. Buoyed by the strategy's success, he penned a similar provision for the recently approved $2 trillion stimulus package in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak. The senator pointed to Buffett when he introduced the Protecting Taxpayers' Return on Investment Act last month. ""When Warren Buffett makes investments in struggling companies that eventually turn around, he is lauded as an astute investor and reaps billions in profits,"" Reed said.  ""Similarly, if taxpayer capital is needed, the terms must be fair to taxpayers, and they should be rewarded for helping struggling companies turn around,"" he added.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL) will sell and lease back 22 planes to Bank of China (BOC) Aviation, for an undisclosed sum. The deal comprises six Boeing 787-9 aircraft and 16 Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft from United Airlines, according to a Bank of China Aviation statement filed to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Sunday. According to the terms of the transaction, the planes will be leased back to United Airlines on long-term agreements. The deal is expected to close some time this year. Singapore-based BOC Aviation is a global aircraft operating leasing company with a fleet of 567 aircrafts as of 31 March 2020. As a result of the coronavirus-related lockdowns across many countries around the world, United Airlines flew less than 200,000 people in the first two weeks of April, a 97% drop from the more than 6 million people it flew during the same time in 2019. Since the start of the year, the U.S. airline has seen as much as 70% of its stock value drop. Shares traded up 3.1% on Friday to close at $29.08. Last week United Airlines said it had cut its flight schedule in May by 90% and expects similar cuts for June due to the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, the U.S. airline also announced that it will receive about $5 billion from the U.S. federal government to be used for the support of employees’ paychecks. In addition, the airline confirmed that there would be no forced furloughs or pay rate cuts for U.S. employees at least until September 30. Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent this month lowered the U.S. airline’s price target to $51 from $87 but maintained a Buy rating on the shares. While Trent expects airline capacity in the second quarter to be down 75% year-over-year, he sees demand declines stemming from the coronavirus pandemic outbreak starting to moderate in the third quarter. Overall, Wall Street analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating for United Airlines based on 6 Buys and 7 Holds.

It’s not all bad,"      Ryan Vanzo | April 19, 2020 | More on: CHR The market crash has created dozens of bargains. The airline industry in particular has been hit hard. Stocks like Chorus Aviation Inc (TSX:CHR.B) have shed nearly 70% of their value. If you’re looking for high-upside stock picks, pay close attention. The bear market has, of course, been spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, sending air traffic spiraling. Carriers like Delta Air Lines are reportedly burning $50 million every day. The entire industry will need a global bailout. But air traffic isn’t disappearing altogether. Population growth and rising incomes across large parts of the world still create a massive long-term growth headwind; more than 80% of the entire world’s population has never stepped foot on a plane. A few years from now, the airline industry could be bigger than ever. A decade from now, investors might wonder how they missed out on such a clear buying opportunity. If you’re willing to be patient, there could be plenty of long-term upside in air transport stocks, specifically Chorus Aviation. The airline industry has been a hot spot for difficult times. For nearly a century, it was investor suicide to touch these stocks. “It’s true that the airlines had a bad 20th century,” Warren Buffett told CNBC, “I think there have been almost 100 airline bankruptcies. I mean, that is a lot. It’s been a disaster for capital.” In a letter to investors in 2007, Buffett wrote, “If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.” But in 2017, Buffett started buying airline stocks. Today, he’s one of the top investors in four different airlines. “They’re like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way, I hope,” Buffett explained. What does Buffett see in the industry? “The hope is they will keep orders in reasonable relationship to potential demand,” he said. It’s actually a simple bet. For years, there were dozens of airliners competing heavily for each route. Aircraft utilization was quite low, pressuring profits. After a period of consolidation, Buffett is betting that the industry will operate rationally. The current pandemic could actually benefit airline stocks, especially companies like Chorus Aviation. That’s because many large competitors could go bankrupt, consolidating the industry even further, which could boost profits and","Apr 19, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/19/buy-alert-chorus-aviation-tsxchr-just-cratered-69/

A selection of cheap,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Matthew Dumigan | Saturday, 18th April, 2020 The stock market crash has caused the FTSE 100 to take a huge hit. The index has shed around 22% of its value since mid-February. While this has damaged share prices across the board, it means there are plenty of stocks trading on dirt-cheap valuations that look like bargains to me. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Be under no illusion, stocks may still have further to fall before the market bottoms out. But I’m confident that in five to 10 years’ time, investors will look back at today’s share prices and recognise many of them as bargains. One thing to be sure of is that the stock market will, as always, eventually recover. Before the stock market crash, two of my favourite FTSE 100 stocks were consumer staples giant Unilever and alcoholic beverages champion Diageo. I like them even more at their lower prices today. These two companies have established market-leading positions. What’s more, both have an impressive track record when it comes to financial performance over recent years. Housebuilding shares plunged in the wake of the market crash as a result of uncertainty caused by the outbreak of Covid-19. However, if lockdown restrictions ease up in the near future, stocks such as Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon could bounce back swiftly, delivering handsome returns for investors. More good news for housebuilders came last week when the government announced it may extend the help-to-buy scheme. If you happen to feel particularly bullish about the recovery of airline stocks, companies such as easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines Group would be my go-to. These two airline operators should have healthy enough balance sheets and sufficient cash reserves to see them through the crisis. Finally, I particularly like the look of Aviva and Legal & General, two outstanding UK insurers. Both firms posted impressive results last year and have cemented their positions in the insurance market.

Weirdest Economy Ever There is something refreshing during these insane times when a guy in his mid-90s who has seen it all and has been successful at navigating it, and who, during the last Financial Crisis, was buying stocks and entire companies hand over-fist, now says that he has never seen anything like this before, and that he doesn’t know what to do except to sit tight. And they’re not buying the rally, and they weren’t buying the crash. Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, was talking with The Wall Street Journal about the current situation and how he and Warren Buffett are looking at it. And they’re not buying. During the Financial Crisis, they were lending money to Goldman Sachs and GE and getting warrants too that turned out to be very profitable, and they bought stocks, and they bought BNSF outright after the partial stake they’d acquired before the Financial Crisis went sour. “Well, I would say basically we’re like the captain of a ship when the worst typhoon that’s ever happened comes,” he told The Wall Street Journal. “We just want to get through the typhoon, and we’d rather come out of it with a whole lot of liquidity. We’re not playing, ‘Oh goody, goody, everything’s going to hell, let’s plunge 100% of the reserves [into buying businesses].’” “We’re always going to be on the safe side. That doesn’t mean we couldn’t do something pretty aggressive or seize some opportunity. But basically, we will be fairly conservative. And we’ll emerge on the other side very strong.” And when the Journal asked him if executives of big companies aren’t now approaching Berkshire and asking capital – as they’d done during the Financial Crisis – he said, “No, they aren’t.” “The typical reaction is that people are frozen,” he said. “Take the airlines. They don’t know what the hell’s doing. They’re all negotiating with the government, but they’re not calling Warren. They’re frozen. They’ve never seen anything like it. Their playbook does not have this as a possibility.” “And the phone is not ringing off the hook,” he said. “Everybody’s just frozen in the position they’re in.” Airline stocks are revealing how the thinking of Munger and Buffett has changed about this crisis.

14,Canadian airlines wait for federal aid package to help travel industry survive COVID-19 | Financial Post,. Breadcrumb Trail Links. Canadian airlines wait for federal aid package to help travel industry survive COVID-19. Article Sidebar. .,"New estimates predict domestic air travel won’t recover until summer and international travel until the end of the year Canadian airlines are waiting for an industry-specific aid package promised by the Government of Canada, but in the meantime are adopting the emergency wage subsidy to help keep flight attendants and pilots on payroll even though the vast majority of flights have been cancelled until at least June. Airlines are grappling with an unprecedented drop in demand for passenger travel as the government fights the coronavirus by imposing travel restrictions and border closures. Passenger revenue is expected to drop by US$64 billion in North America and US$314 billion globally in 2020 compared to last year, according to updated estimates from the International Air Transportation Association, which represents 290 airlines comprising 82 per cent of global air traffic. With new estimates predicting domestic air travel won’t recover until summer and international travel until the end of the year, Canadian airlines are advocating behind the scenes for government aid — quickly. The National Airlines Council of Canada has been pressing for measures including liquidity, a break from fees such as airport rent and taxes, and updated regulatory measures that could simplify operations in the short term. The NACC, which represents Air Canada, WestJet Airlines Ltd., Transat AT and Jazz Aviation LP, has emphasized how critical air connections are, not only for transporting cargo during the pandemic but also for resuming the economy once the crisis abates. Individual airlines have been reluctant to discuss specific requests publicly lest they strike the wrong message with officials holding the purse strings. But the industry is eyeing the US$25 billion aid package the United States announced for 10 of its major carriers earlier this week. That relief package intends to cover salaries until September, includes grants, low-interest loans and equity warrants that give the government the option to buy the airlines’ stocks. Airlines have agreed not to cut jobs or pay for the duration of the aid. If Canada adopts a similar strategy, Air Canada could be eligible for more than $1 billion in aid on top of the wage subsidy, Scotiabank analyst Konark Gupta noted to clients this week. “We believe any substantial incremental financial aid, depending on the terms, could potentially lift investor sentiment as concerns have risen about AC’s balance sheet coming out of this downturn, particularly given uncertainty around the extent of COVID-19","Apr 19, 2020",https://financialpost.com/transportation/airlines/canadian-airlines-wait-for-federal-aid-package-to-help-travel-industry-survive-covid-19

17,The Pressure Facing Large Aircraft Lessors In 2020 - Simple Flying,The Pressure Facing Large Aircraft Lessors In 2020. About the industry. Mounting pressure. First warning signs. Karol Ciesluk. Related Articles:.," The coverage of the current aviation crisis has mainly focused on airlines and manufacturers. Without a doubt, these are the most severely impacted players in the industry. However, very soon, another vital component of the aviation industry might come under pressure. Aircraft lessors could face mounting financial pressures and significant disruption to their pre-pandemic activity; in fact, first signs of that are already evident. Last week, we wrote an introductory piece about aircraft leasing, where we explained the business concept and the various types of leases. Before we dive slightly more in-depth into the likely impact on aircraft lessors, it is worth taking a closer look at the key players within the industry. There are around 150 leasing companies globally, while the market is worth close to $300 bn. In 2019 the world’s five largest firms owned a total of over 3,860 planes. GECAS and AerCap are the most prominent players, both holding over a thousand airplanes. Other big names in the industry are Avolon, BBAM, Nordic Aviation Capital, and Air Lease Corporation. A few industry operational features are worth highlighting before we continue. Airplane lessors tend to have a diversified customer base; that is, they prefer to lease a smaller amount of planes to more airlines to mitigate the financial risk of their clients’ bankruptcies. They also tend to lease the same airplane to various airlines throughout their lifetime. That also reduces risk and increases flexibility to the prevailing market conditions. Furthermore, lessors finance airplane purchases with a mix of cash and loans. They are usually very indebted (80% debt to equity for Aercap, 75% for Air Lease, for example) and need the contractual payments from the airlines to fulfill their debt obligations. As airlines are contractually obliged to fulfill their leasing payments, even in past industry downturns, the leasing companies have performed well. This time, however, the scale of the problem is so much greater that no diversification nor financial engineering would have left them prepared. There are plenty of ways in which the revenue of aircraft lessors will be affected, for example: The biggest threat is the bankruptcy of a lessee. In such a case, the plane returns to the lessor for which it won’t receive the amount of money expected. That can create serious issues for these highly leveraged companies, as they stop receiving cash needed to cover the loans they obtained to buy the","Apr 19, 2020",https://simpleflying.com/aircraft-lessors-pressure/
