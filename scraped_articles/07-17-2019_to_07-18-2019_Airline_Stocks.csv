0,Airline Stocks Fly Above Resistance on United Earnings,Airline Stocks Fly Above Resistance After Upbeat United Earnings. United's quarterly profit more than doubled on strong travel demand. U.S.,"Airline stock returns have trailed the broader market year to date (YTD), mainly due to the ongoing grounding of The Boeing Company's (BA) fourth-generation 737 aircraft – the 737 Max. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prevented airlines from flying the popular jet in March after two fatal crashes, forcing thousands of canceled flights during the lucrative summer travel season. Despite this challenge, earnings from United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL) gave the sector a much needed lift after the Chicago-based airline reported that its second quarter (Q2) profit soared more than 50% from a year ago on strong travel demand. United's better-than-expected earnings came only days after Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) raised its 2019 profit outlook, noting increased demand for premium-class and corporate travel. From a technical standpoint, the airline industry's leading exchange-traded fund (ETF) – the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) – broke above a crucial resistance level in Monday's trading session that could trigger additional momentum-based buying. Traders who follow the sector should monitor Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK), which also broke above significant resistance yesterday ahead of its Q2 earnings on July 25. Taking off in 2015, the U.S. Global Jets ETF aims to track the performance of the U.S. Global Jets Index. The fund invests its $69.56 asset base in companies within the airline industry, which includes commercial airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airports. Both United and Delta feature prominently in the ETF's portfolio, with respective weightings of 12.53% and 12.76%. JETS has decent daily dollar volume liquidity of almost $1 million most days, although an average 0.20% spread may be too wide for scalping small intraday moves. A 0.50% dividend yield mostly offsets the fund's 0.60% annual management fee. JETS has returned 12.30% YTD, underperforming the Dow Jones Transportation Average by 5.41% over the same period as of July 17, 2019. The ETF's share price has oscillated within a $2.50 range between February and July, offering several high-probability trading opportunities from clearly defined support and resistance levels. United's better-than-expected earnings helped the ETF close convincingly above the trading range's upper trendline at $31.50 in Tuesday's trading session. The breakout may result in the price gaining more altitude and test the 52-week high at $33.21. Those who take a long position should protect their downside with a stop-loss order placed just beneath yesterday's low at $31.32 in case momentum stalls.

1,The 10 Cheapest Warren Buffett Stocks | Kiplinger,Save up to 67%. The 10 Cheapest Warren Buffett Stocks. . Data is as of July 17. Forward price-to-earnings ratios,"Getty Images Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), is renowned for his ability to find bargains, but with markets at record highs, cheap stocks are getting tougher and tougher to find. That’s true even within Berkshire Hathaway's own portfolio. Indeed, several Buffett stocks have gained some froth of their own. Many, however, still look plenty cheap for new money. After looking at where shares trade relative to expected earnings, in comparison to their own historical valuations, and vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, numerous Berkshire Hathaway holdings still appear downright cheap. We sorted through all 48 stocks in the Berkshire portfolio to find the biggest bargains left standing after the market’s amazing run so far in 2019. Here are the cheapest Warren Buffett stocks right now. 1 of 10 Getty Images Warren Buffett’s stocks have been increasingly peppered with banks over the past several quarters, but his interest in Bank of New York Mellon (BK, $44.12) dates back to 2010 and the early innings of the current economic expansion. Financial-sector stocks were generally cheap in the aftermath of the financial crisis. BK remains attractively priced to this day. Trading at just 10.4 times expected earnings, shares offer a discount of 23% to their own five-year average price-to-earnings ratio, according to data from StockReports+ from Refinitiv. But wait, there’s more. BK is almost 40% less expensive than the S&P 500 on an expected-earnings basis. (The S&P 500 currently goes for 17.2 times projected earnings, according to Refinitiv.) Warren Buffett last added to his BK stake in the fourth quarter of 2018 when he increased Berkshire Hathaway’s investment by 3%, or more than 3 million shares. With a total of 80.9 million shares, BRK.B owns 8.5% of all shares outstanding, making it BK’s largest investor by a decent margin, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. (Vanguard is No. 2 at 6.8%.) 2 of 10 Getty Images Warren Buffett caused something of a stir back in 2016 when he bought a quartet of airline stocks. The Oracle had long been an outspoken critic of the air-carrier industry, but times change. After a terrible 20th century, Buffett says he likes what airlines have to offer in the 21st. Its shares also happen to be something of a bargain. LUV trades at nearly a 19% discount to its own five-year average forward P/E ratio.

Oil prices inched up on Thursday, extending solid gains from the previous session on a fall in U.S. crude inventories and expected disruptions to supply from Iran and Venezuela, the Reuters report suggested. In past one month, airline stocks have underperformed the market by falling in the range of 8% to 25%, as compared to a 3% rise in the Sensex.

SpiceJet slipped 4% to Rs 78.15, trading close to its 52-week low of Rs 76.05 touched on Friday, August 24, 2018. Three aviation companies had reported a combined net loss of Rs 13.33 billion in April-June 2018 quarter (Q1FY19). These companies posted an aggregate net profit of Rs 10.37 billion in the same quarter last fiscal. The profitability was majorly impacted by the adverse impact of foreign exchange, high fuel prices and the competitive fare environment. “Sharp uptick in ATF prices (accounted for 40% of revenue in past) and INR depreciation (the bulk of the cost is USD denominated) will impact profitability given high price sensitivity of the Indian consumer leaving limited ability to pass on costs. Existing airports at Indian metros like Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata running at peak capacity could prove to be bottlenecks for growth,” analysts at Edelweiss Securities said in result update.

Last Updated at July 18, 2019 10:42 IST STOCK PRICE - CLICK HERE FOR MORE BSE 101.600.05 (0.05%) NSE 101.650.05 (0.05%) Shares of SpiceJet were trading higher for the seventh consecutive session, surging 9 per cent intra-day, to trade at Rs 144 apiece on the BSE on Wednesday supported by heavy volumes. During the past week, the airline's stock has rallied 23 per cent as against a per cent rise in the benchmark index. Jet Airways and InterGlobe Aviation (parent company of IndiGo), on the other hand, have tanked 20 per cent and 6 per cent respectively during the same period. “While SpiceJet is a key beneficiary of slots vacated by Jet Airways at the constrained airports, it would be interesting to see how it capitalizes on the same even as it has commenced operations on some of the highly competitive metro routes,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities said adding, ""Sector consolidation is an opportunity for the company to recoup lost market share but the ability to profitably deploy the massive increase in capacity will be the key to the stock’s performance”. It further added that substantial delays in resuming Max operations may impact capacity growth for the airline. For SpiceJet, early resolution on 737 Max is important to get the most out of its cost-reduction measures, it added. For the quarter ended June 2019 (Q1FY20), analysts at Edelweiss Securities expect SpiceJet to post six-fold year on year (YoY) jump in net profit at Rs 154 crore. It had profit of Rs 25 crore in a year ago quarter. “Yield expansion (+5 per cent YoY) would be lower than Indigo; however, coupled with robust PAX growth (+25 per cent YoY), revenue will increase by 36 per cent YoY. Lower aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices (- 1.2 per cent YoY) will lead to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (EBITDAR) close to doubling YoY.

Revenue was just above forecasts, with the bank’s results helped in part by stronger retail banking performance. Net interest income came in slightly below analysts’ forecasts, however. United Airlines – United earned an adjusted $4.21 per share for the second quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $4.09 a share. The airline’s revenue also beat estimates, and revenue per available seat mile rose 2.5%. United still expects profits to rise despite capacity cuts caused by the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jet. CSX – CSX came in 3 cents a share shy of forecasts, with quarterly profit of $1.08 per share. The rail operator’s revenue missed estimates, as well. CSX’s results were impacted by the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute, and the company also cut its full-year revenue forecast. PNC Financial – PNC beat estimates by 6 cents a share, with quarterly profit of $2.88 per share. Revenue was also slightly above Street forecasts, aided by a rise in interest income and in loan volume.

DOJ officials pointed to support for that move from the Energy and Defense Departments, which say it would be impossible to replace Qualcomm’s role in 5G technology.

7,Netflix stock is crashing – 7 experts explain what comes next,Netflix just had its worst day in three years – 7 experts on what comes next. MORE IN TRADING NATION.,"Netflix is not so chill right now. For the first time since 2011, Netflix reported a loss of 126,000 U.S. subscribers in its most recent three-month stretch. International subscribers increased by only 2.7 million, far below expectations of 5 million. Shares dropped more than 10% on Thursday, a day after the report came out. With a handful of other streaming services getting ready to compete for Netflix’s market share, there is a lot of uncertainty in how the ‘streaming wars’ play out. Here’s what seven experts think comes next. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, sees a bright future in the fourth quarter even after this disappointing earnings report. “To be fair, their subscription numbers often vary widely from estimates... Normally, they’re much better, so this is not great news. But, just a little-known fact [is] that the second-quarter earnings for Netflix have been historically the worst for the stock. It averages a decline of 6% when it reports second-quarter earnings. Fourth quarter is the best quarter for the stock... I think it’s seasonality... So, it’s a weak quarter, but in our survey work that we’ve done, we were interviewing consumers about this. 59% of Netflix subscribers have used it in the last 24 hours. So, it’s very sticky competition — they’re looking at Disney Plus as more of a compliment as opposed to competition for the service. And low single digits view “The Office” or “Friends” as a requirement for Netflix... I like to think of those things as the bread when you go out to a restaurant. It’s there, everybody eats it, but at the end of the day that’s not what you’re buying.” Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown says he doesn’t think Netflix can make up for the loss of big shows such as “Friends” and “The Office.” “Do you buy the argument that they’re going to free up budget and easily replace things like “Friends” and “The Office”? Because I got to tell you, those shows were made in a different era where you can reasonably produce 23 episodes a season, and do that for eight seasons. That is a lot of shows. The new Netflix shows, it’s like six episodes, they’re an hour long each — and they cost probably five times as much. So, I don’t know that you can just say, ‘Oh well, we’re not going to pay content and licensing","Jul 18, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/netflix-stock-is-crashing-7-experts-explain-what-comes-next.html

After they have traded all their time for all the money they are left with no time to enjoy the money.

This is liberating due to the simple fact that you can now earn an income now based on the task you are currently acting on but based on the systems you have set in place.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   American Airlines (AAL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This world's largest airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.6%. Revenues are expected to be $11.96 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Spirit Airlines Insider Transactions Over The Last","Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card! We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So before you buy or sell Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE), you may well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling. It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information. We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.' View our latest analysis for Spirit Airlines In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior VP & Chief Information Officer, Rocky Wiggins, sold US$228k worth of shares at a price of US$50.56 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$50.65. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 17.5% of Rocky Wiggins's stake. In the last twelve months insiders netted US$652k for 12266 shares sold. Insiders in Spirit Airlines didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! The last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Spirit Airlines shares. Specifically, Senior VP & Chief HR Officer Martha Villa ditched US$204k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever.
