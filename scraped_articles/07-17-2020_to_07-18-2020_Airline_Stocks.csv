1,Don't Expect Earnings to Provide a Reason to Own United Airlines Stock | InvestorPlace,Don’t Expect Earnings to Provide a Reason to Own United Airlines Stock. Q2 numbers will be ugly — but the," There is a case for airline stocks at the moment. But choosing United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) in that group seems potentially foolish. There’s just not a strong enough argument for United Airlines stock even for investors bullish on the sector. With United set to report second quarter earnings on Wednesday morning, some investors might hope that UAL stock is nearing another bottom. Indeed, airline stocks have caught a bounce in recent sessions, after fading from early June highs. From a short-term perspective, the rally may continue. Investors are getting earnings next week not just from United, but from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) on Thursday morning. The numbers are going to be ugly, as a report this week showed, but at this point any news might be considered good news. Taking the broader view, however, an investor choosing United Airlines stock now needs to believe the name will outperform. For several reasons, that seems doubtful. There are key concerns here, concerns that aren’t going to be fixed by earnings next week — or any time soon. We know United earnings are going to be historically awful. Obviously, the performance will have little, if anything, to do with United’s execution. With airports shut down and flights canceled worldwide, there simply was nothing United or its peers could do. We already got a preview this week as Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) reported its second-quarter earnings. Excluding its owned oil refinery, Delta’s revenue declined an incredible 91% year-over-year. Delta stock declined after the report, though it’s likely a headline earnings miss wasn’t the culprit. Rather, as I wrote before that release, Delta management needed to tell a story that could inspire confidence. Unsurprisingly, it wasn’t able to do so. It’s difficult to see how United can do any better. Its management credibility is far lower. Despite one of the industry’s highest debt loads, United made little effort to fix its balance sheet before the pandemic hit, despite an economic recovery that was the longest on record. In fact, its debt rose in recent years. Meanwhile, Delta already tamped down expectations. Its chief executive officer warned investors that it would be “more than two years” before the industry recovered. If United executives are more optimistic, I’m skeptical investors will listen. And that in turn suggests that United Airlines stock is going to have a hard time rallying.

2,Should you invest in aviation stocks? - Blog by Tickertape,Should you invest in aviation stocks?. . Broad Trends. Financial Analysis. Operating costs for airlines. Fuel cost. Foreign exchange expenditure.,"India’s first commercial air carrier started in 1932 and, a few years later, it was nationalised. Till the early 1990s, there were only two players in the market – Air India and Indian Airlines. However, post the Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation (LPG) reforms in the early 1990s, various players entered the industry, and the composition at present is as under:   Out of the players mentioned above, Indigo (Interglobe Aviation Ltd.) and SpiceJet (SpiceJet Ltd.) are listed on the stock exchange. The industry has promising growth due to the following factors:   Looking at the above, an initial reaction would likely be – why not invest in airline stocks? With Kingfisher shuttered and Jet Airways and Air India in a soup, Indigo and Spicejet have nothing prima facie that can stop them for soaring high in the sky (pun intended). Here’s the catch – a dominant force that sways the pendulum on the other side of the scale is the highly sensitive cost of operating for airlines in India. Before deep diving, here’s a snapshot of the Revenue and Net Profit (Profit After Tax) for Indigo and Spicejet for the last five years: In both the companies, though the Revenues are increasing Year-on-Year, the Net Profit is highly volatile. To understand the difference in the movements of both, let us first dissect the total costs incurred by airlines. Major cost components are fuel costs, aircraft rentals and foreign exchange expenses. A discussion on the same is hereunder: Indian airlines’ fuel cost as a percentage of total costs is among the highest in the world. Airlines require Aviation Turbine Fuel which is a derivative of crude oil. Here are the price movements of both in recent years. Just like any other commodity, the laws of demand and supply affect crude oil prices. The OPEC cartel also influences oil prices considerably as they control significant crude oil supply in the world. Now your question would be that crude oil, in turn, affects the prices of petrol, diesel and is a significant raw material for a lot of industries, then why this phenomenon is peculiar to the airlines industry? To answer this question, we will have to look at the changes in airfare in recent years: We don’t see the airfares increasing because the airlines are engaged in price wars. This means that they do not pass on the increase in","Jul 17, 2020",https://blog.tickertape.in/should-you-invest-in-aviation-stocks/
3,Delta Air Lines Just Showed Why You Should Sell Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock,. S&P/TSX. S&P 500. DOW. CAD/USD. CRUDE OIL. BTC-CAD. CMC Crypto 200. GOLD FUTURES. RUSSELL 2000. 10-Yr Bond. NASDAQ. VOLATILITY.," Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE:DAL) has some bad news. Only July 14, it posted a bigger-than-expected loss. Airline investors hoping for a return to normalcy were shocked. “We are now four months into the pandemic, and the nearly $4 billion pre-tax loss that we just posted, reflects the severe impact that COVID-19 is having on our company and our industry,” CEO Ed Bastian explained. Earlier this summer, many analysts expected a sharp uptick in airline traffic, buoyed by leisure travel and a rebound in business activity. The latest resurgence in case numbers threw cold water on those hopes. “We’re expecting our overall revenue for the September quarter will be only 20% to 25% of what we saw last summer,” Bastian warned. “And we’ve seen demand growth flattened recently with the rise in COVID-19 cases. We’re watching trends closely and have pared back our capacity plans for August.” Of course, Delta doesn’t operate in a bubble. None of its current challenges are unique to its particular business model. The entire industry is in turmoil. Nearly every operator is generating multi-million dollar losses on a daily basis. “In June, our daily cash burn for the month averaged $27 million a day,” Bastian revealed. This is actually a substantial improvement to the $100 million per day in cash burn that the company experienced in March. What does all of this mean for Canadian carriers like Air Canada? As you can imagine, the data is bleak For years, Air Canada (TSX:AC) was a special case. In 2012, shares were priced at $1. At the start of 2020, they surpassed $50. The reason for this spectacular rise was industry consolidation. Warren Buffett famously avoided the airline sector for decades due to overly-fierce competition. But in recent years, he was persuaded to invest. Before the COVID-19 crisis, he was a leading shareholder of four different airlines, including Delta. In 2012, Canada’s airline market was a mess. Fast forward to today, when Air Canada controls roughly half of the domestic market. This dominant position creates more rational pricing, a direct boon for profits.               These investments have paid off since March's meltdown. Here's why another correction will bring attractive prices.

4,Airline stocks hit by prolonged travel demand slump and state aid requirement claims,Airline stocks hit by prolonged travel demand slump and state aid requirement claims. Read More. Read More. . Revoiced Newsletter.,"Leading airline shares fell after it was claimed increased levels of government financial support will be needed to save carriers and demand for airline travel won’t return to pre-Covid crisis levels for another three and a half years. Global airline passenger demand won’t recover to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels until the end of 2023, and only then if effective vaccines and medicines are available, according to Moody’s Investors Service. On the back of that Aer Lingus and British Airways owner IAG fell 2.3%, Ryanair shed 2.6%, EasyJet fell by 3.2%, Air France-KLM tumbled by more than 3% and Lufthansa slipped 1.6%. The recovery for airlines and airports will be largely aligned, followed by aircraft lessors as carriers return fleets to service, Moody’s analysts said. Manufacturers - such as Boeing and Airbus - will be the last in the direct aviation industry to regain their 2019 footing, they said. Demand dropped by more than 90% within weeks of the onset of the pandemic, a slump that impacted a broad swathe of the global economy given that passenger airlines supported about 3% of world GDP in 2019, according to Moody’s. The development of a vaccine will be key in determining the industry’s recovery, both fundamentally and financially, while more government support will probably be necessary to ensure airlines survive, Moody’s said.   “With an effective coronavirus vaccine likely not available before well into 2021 – and likely longer to cover potential mutations of the virus and to ensure adequate dosage supply for the masses – additional government support will be required for the airline industry if employment levels are to be maintained near already reduced levels, and potentially to stave off additional airline restructurings and insolvency proceedings,” Moody’s said. British Airways, the world’s biggest operator of Boeing's 747 aircraft, is retiring its entire fleet of the jumbo jets with immediate effect because of the damage the coronavirus has done to air travel. “It is unlikely our magnificent ‘queen of the skies’ will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again due to the downturn in travel caused by the Covid-19 global pandemic,” the airline said. Meanwhile, Cathay Pacific has warned it is set to post a first-half net loss of about HK$9.9bn (€1.1bn) as the coronavirus decimates air travel, with the Hong Kong carrier flying less than 1% of its usual number of passengers in recent months.

Today's gains were driven by the healthcare sector; more than a dozen of the index's best-performers today included companies like Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN), Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), and Stryker Corp (NYSE:SYK), all up more than 3% to close out the week.  Asset management giant Blackrock Inc (NYSE:BLK) stock gained 4% today following the company's earnings report, on strong growth in demand for bonds during the recession.   IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. On the downside, investor worry over the tightening jobs market is taking some wind out of the sails for travel and leisure stocks, as well as oil stocks. Some of the day's biggest losers were MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Apache Corp (NASDAQ:APA), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), all down around 4% or more.  Today's worst-performing S&P 500 stock was Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). The streaming giant reported earnings after market close yesterday, and despite adding more new subscribers than expected, investors are selling en masse, sending the stock down nearly 7% today.  Investors in the streaming giant have enjoyed enormous long-term returns, as well as a big run-up on the stock recently as investors piled in during the weeks heading into earnings. In the first two weeks of July, shares surged up 24%, but the good run came to an end today as investors sold following yesterday evening's earnings results.  Netflix reported a great second quarter, adding a Q2-record 10.1 million subscribers. Revenue increased 25%, and operating profits doubled. But management rained on the parade with guidance that didn't make investors happy. CEO Reed Hastings (now co-CEO after the promotion of Ted Sarandos to share the big chair) said that because the company ""pulled forward"" so many new customers in the second quarter, management now expects to add only 2.5 million new subscribers in Q3.  Result? Investors who've done so well recently are taking their money and running today, despite the enormous financial improvements Netflix continues to deliver.  The healthcare sector delivered a great day for investors. The SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF (NYSEMKT:XHE) and SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF (NYSEMKT:XHS) subsector ETFs were big winners, up 2.6% and 1.2% to close out the week.

8,Why Virgin Galactic Stock Is Still Rocketing Higher Friday | The Motley Fool,Why Virgin Galactic Stock Is Still Rocketing Higher Friday. Virgin Galactic dreams of building a space entertainment empire.. What happened.,"   For the second day in a row, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock is rocking and rolling higher. After locking down a 13.6% gain Thursday on the back of news that it has hired a new CEO, Virgin Galactic shares are up another 9.4% as of 10:30 a.m. EDT Friday. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. There's no new news to explain the stock's rise, however. Logically, therefore, what we're seeing today is just a continuation of investors' enthusiasm over yesterday's appointment. On Thursday, Virgin Galactic tapped former Disney exec Michael Colglazier to replace current CEO George Whitesides. The change in management will take place on Monday. Investors may be taking this as a positive development for two reasons. On the surface, Virgin Galactic looks a bit like a low-margin airline stock (its immediate objective, after all, is to push people aboard space ""planes"" and fly them up, then fly them back down again). But at second glance it's potentially a higher-margin consumer goods stock. Once its spaceplanes begin flying, Virgin Galactic will be offering customers a unique entertainment experience including probably a week-long stay at its Spaceport America while they train to become astronauts, followed by the flight to space itself. That's an entertainment business, in my view, and who better than the former head of Disneyland to run it? At the same time, Virgin Galactic appears to be setting its sights higher than just operating a no-tracks-required rollercoaster ride to space and back. Instead of leaving the company, you see, Whitesides will take over the role of chief space officer at Virgin. In this capacity, he will continue to develop ""future business opportunities"" for Virgin, ""including point-to-point hypersonic travel and orbital space travel"" -- part of the reason that Morgan Stanley initially recommended Virgin Galactic stock in late 2019, lighting a fuse under Virgin Galactic shares that has yet to be extinguished. Incidentally, back then Morgan Stanley seemed to think its $22 price target on Virgin shares was a bit of a stretch. Today, those shares trade for $23 a share.

12,British Airways is grounding its fleet of 747 jets for good - BNN Bloomberg,. BNN. COMPANY NEWS. . COMPANY NEWS. News Wire. British Airways is grounding its fleet of 747 jets for good.,"  MORE  Latest Videos  Most Popular Content Jul 17, 2020  Will Davies, Bloomberg News A cyclist passes a passenger aircraft, operated by British Airways. , Simon Dawson/Bloomberg British Airways, the world’s biggest operator of Boeing Co. 747-400s, is retiring its entire fleet of the jumbo jets with immediate effect because of the damage the coronavirus has done to air travel. “It is unlikely our magnificent ‘queen of the skies’ will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again due to the downturn in travel caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic,” the airline, a unit of IAG SA, said in a statement. The carrier’s 31 Boeing 747-400 planes, which could sit 345 passengers in four classes, flew to destinations including Beijing, New York, San Francisco, Cape Town and Lagos, until COVID-19 struck and forced the airline to park them. British Airways had planned to finish phasing out the aircraft in 2024. The pandemic has devastated the aviation industry, with governments around the world imposing unprecedented travel restrictions to try to stop its spread. Airlines have grounded much or all of their fleets as they recalibrate to the slump in demand. They’re also assessing which aircraft will best suit their needs when the market recovers to pre-virus levels, something that’s not widely expected until at least 2023. Qantas Airways Ltd. is among other carriers to recently retire the 747, offering farewell “joy flights” above Australian cities earlier this week. A handful continue to operate the jumbo for passenger services, including Air China Ltd. and Korean Air Lines Co. “While the aircraft will always have a special place in our heart, as we head into the future we will be operating more flights on modern, fuel-efficient aircraft such as our new A350s and 787s, to help us achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” British Airways said. Boeing will stop making the 747 soon anyway, with the last likely to roll out of a Seattle-area factory in about two years, people familiar with the matter have said. Airbus SE is also moving on from its giant A380 double-decker jet, as airline customers turn in favor of twin-engine aircraft for long-range flights. British Airways has come under fire for its plans to eliminate 12,000 jobs, about 30 per cent of its workforce, while also tapping a state furlough initiative aimed at protecting employment.

16,American Airlines (AAL) Keeps Growing Against the Staff Reduction,American Airlines (AAL) Keeps Growing Against the Staff Reduction," American Airlines (AAL) might lay off 20,000 staff members. American Airlines (AAL) might temporarily lay off 20,000 employees.  The company informed its employees about the possibility of them being forced to take a leave without pay. Thus, American Airlines' employees should get prepared for a few layoffs in the fall.  It is important to mention that the U.S. labour law requires employers to give workers a notice of possibility of being dismissed no later than 60 days in advance. Another information to consider is that $25 billion were allocated to airlines to maintain jobs until October in the United States. However, the AAL stock seems to ignore the negative news around the company as the share has bounced off the support around $11 and about to retest the local resistance. Thus, the growth is accompanied by the trading volume, which means that it is unlikely to be a false breakout. If the growth continues, the asset may reach the zone of $15-$15.50 before the end of July 2020. Saad is an engineer with more than a decade of experience in FMCG companies.
