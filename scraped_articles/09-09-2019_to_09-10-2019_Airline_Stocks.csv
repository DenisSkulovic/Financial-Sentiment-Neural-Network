USD/JPY.,"                                                   In the past week, Spirit Airlines SAVE and JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU trimmed unit revenue projections for third-quarter 2019. Sprit Airlines went a step further and predicted higher non-fuel unit costs for the September quarter mainly due to Hurricane Dorian. Delta Air Lines DAL also featured in the headlines due to its encouraging traffic report for August, wherein load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion.  Additionally, at the Cowen and Company 12th Annual Global Transportation conference, the carrier reiterated its revenue and earnings guidance for the September quarter. Latin American carriers — GOL Linhas GOL and Azul — also reported an increase in load factor for August as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion owing to robust demand for air travel. Load factor also increased at Hawaiian Holdings' HA wholly owned subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, for the same month. Meanwhile, United Airlines UAL tweaked its third-quarter projection on passenger unit revenues. The Chicago-based carrier expects sluggish demand in China, including Hong Kong, to hurt third-quarter 2019 revenues. Also, Alaska Air Group ALK revised its guidance for third-quarter unit revenues. The carrier expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to improve in the 3-5% range year over year (the earlier guidance had projected an increase in the 2-5% range). Economic fuel cost is now projected to be $2.15 per gallon compared with the earlier projection of $2.21 per gallon.  (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here). Recap of Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Spirit Airlines, which cancelled 768 flights due to Hurricane Dorian, now anticipates total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) to decline 2.5-3.5% year over year in the September quarter. The low-cost carrier had previously anticipated TRASM to slide in the 1-2% range. Spirit expects an approximate $25-million revenue impact due to Hurricane Dorian. Adjusted non-fuel unit costs are expected to increase 9-10% year over year in the third quarter, reflecting a 200-basis points increase from the prior estimate. The adversity is due to reduced capacity and higher costs associated with Hurricane Dorian.","Sep 10, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-stock-roundup-save-jblus-152003803.html

CNBC Newsletters,"The market leaders are now lagging. Onetime leaders in the information technology and REITs sectors are now trailing the market. Meanwhile, energy and financials are the best performers so far this week after getting crushed earlier in the year. CNBC’s Jim Cramer and two other experts weigh in on the sector rotation. Dave Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, says the best tech stocks could still lead. “Look at some of the fundamentals as to where the economy is going. And some of the technology companies still remain growing more of the services-oriented [offerings] in terms of subscriptions and software as a service with some visible revenue growth … It’s a key attribute that portfolio managers at this juncture are really looking for in an uncertain environment … Where do you find investment opportunities? It tends to be where there’s more visible revenue growth.” Stephen Suttmeier, chief equity technical strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, sees this as just the beginning of a broader move. “Yesterday was the start of a rotation. I mean, you saw growth get trounced versus value. You saw defensives lose versus more cynical areas. So I mean, I don’t think that it’s the end of the world for technology, or you know, software names, but I think if, for instance, if people came in very pessimistic on equities they were pretty bullish on bonds, so yields are backed up so maybe there is a bid here for financials for a little while. That could pile all this higher.” Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” says even the outperformers in tech and other sectors are being swept up in a wave of selling. “Why not go back to value? The answer is because ... they’re now hitting even the companies that have been consistent. Procter has been a massive outperformer, and they’re getting hit. The companies, by the way, that are being hit almost entirely beat the market, beat their estimates, but no one really seems to care.” Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip?

Stay connected. Download our,"EasyJet could emerge as a surprise takeover target in an expected further wave of consolidation in the European airline sector, Davy Stockbrokers has said. EasyJet could emerge as a surprise takeover target in an expected further wave of consolidation in the European airline sector, Davy Stockbrokers has said. The Luton-based airline is the fifth largest European carrier and is second only to Ryanair in the low fares sector. ""We think industry consolidation is likely to continue and argue that even EasyJet could be a target over the medium term,"" Davy analysts Stephen Furlong and Ross Harvey said in a research note on the sector. ""We expect further consolidation to come from a mix of organic consolidation, M&A [mergers and acquisitions] and market exits/bankruptcies - perhaps quicker than the market would think,"" they said. ""It may not feel like it, but the structural underpinnings of the European airline sector continue to improve. Those that deliver - the five leading airlines - now control over 60% of intra-European capacity and almost 90% of profits. The rest - except for [Hungarian budget carrier] Wizz - are characterised by a long tail and are struggling,"" they said. EasyJet recently took an Austrian-based air operators' licence to protect its flying rights within the EU after Brexit. It is also majority owned by EU nationals, which also complys with EU ownership rules. Its shares were moderately down on a mixed day for airline stocks. But EasyJet and Ryanair, Aer Lingus and British Airways-owner IAG, and Lufthansa are all down between 29% and 33% in the last 12 months. EasyJet confirmed it is interested in the operations of Aigle Azur at Paris' Orly Airport. The French airline went into receivership last week, suspending flights and leaving 19,000 passengers stranded. Air France-KLM shares dropped by nearly 10% on the back of it saying last-minute demand in the crucial summer season has been disappointing and August passenger figures were mixed. Investors also reacted cooly to news of it being a likely bidder for the Aigle Azur business.

6,A Singaporean’s practical guide to buying stocks | DBS Singapore,Beginner’s guide to stock investing for Singaporeans. Step 1: Open a brokerage account. Step 2: Ensure you have a “safe”,"Stocks are a necessary part of any retirement plan. That’s because globally, equities/stocks vastly outperform bonds for investment returns over the long-term. Cash has been the standout loser, usually failing to keep up with inflation.

So, if you want to build up a significant retirement nest egg, get on with the task of investing in shares now. It’s really not as overwhelming as it seems. Start by opening an account with an investment platform. This platform executes your investment decisions for you – whether you want to buy or sell a specific stock. They would typically also offer you a range of related services, including: Here’s how you can test the quality of your investment platform  Whatever your choice, you’ll need to understand the system, the trade terminology and processes. That will allow you to make full use of the platform’s features. (If you’re trying to figure your way around a DBS Vickers Online Account, watch this video or download this user guide).  You’ll need somewhere to store your purchased stocks, ETFs, REITs, and bonds. When you buy Singapore stocks, your holdings are safe-kept in this storehouse. Similarly, when you sell your stocks, the shares are transferred from it to the buyer’s account. Easy peasy.

Some brokers provide this facility through their ‘custody service’. This means that your investments are stored in their storeroom for you.

Others offer pure brokerage services, which means you’ll need a CDP account to store the Singapore stocks that you’ve bought. And if your broker aims for a seamless experience like Vickers Online does, they’ll help you with all the paperwork. One less step for you. Most investors will say that their end goal is ""to make money"". But what’s also important is ‘how fast’: are you investing to make money gradually, or quickly?

If you’re in for quick winnings, you could be setting yourself up for disappointment. However, if you're about building patient wealth over the course of your life with long-term goals—your children's education, a comfortable retirement—let’s start.

In general, there are three kinds of players in the market: the long-term investor, the trader, and the victim. The long-term investor

7,Will Jet Airways ever fly again?,Will Jet Airways ever fly again?. Let’s see the timeline below to understand the takeoff and rough landing of the,"“India's aviation market is cut-throat and it is survival of the fittest. One needs not only deep pockets but a deep threshold for pain,” said Shukor Yusof, the head of the aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.  17th April, 2019 saw the temporary stoppage of operations of the oldest private airline, Jet Airways. Financial concerns and a cash-strapped situation forced Jet Airways to suspend all international and domestic flights. It was a step taken to prevent any bankruptcy situation affecting the aircraft, assets and the staff to get stranded elsewhere.  But doesn't it sound very shocking to think that an airline of such high stature crashed this badly! The start of Jet Airways: It began operations in 1992 and was founded as a public-private split between Naresh Goyal, Gulf Air, and Kuwait Airways. By 1996, the company gained a market share of 20% in India with possession of twelve aircraft, flying 83 daily flights across 23 destinations in India. However, all of this expansion was on the basis of foreign investment. When the government of India imposed no investment by foreign companies in the private airlines of India, Naresh Goyal purchased back the remaining 40% (the share of Gulf Air and Kuwait Airlines). Jet goes public: Jet Airways listed itself on the stock exchange of India to raise funds for its expansion in 2003. 20% of the company was offered to investors and it was enough to raise funds.
A green signal from the government to let private airlines fly everywhere in the world except the Middle East made the company use the earned money to secure slots and flying services between London Heathrow and other places. Not just that, the company acquired Sahara Airlines in 2007 for a lump-sum of Rs. 1450 crores.  Airline Price War: Jet Airways' success was temporary and the airline industry saw other competitors. The demand was falling and price competition was increasing because of other players who lowered their prices. This was the start of the death of Jet Airways. The company took to taking more debts and used its cash reserve to stay in the competition. 
The beginning of all financial problems: After 6 straight years of losses, Jet Airways finally struck profits in 2016. But, it was very short-lived. The company was surviving until its 25th anniversary in 2017 but saw a downward spiral encroaching at a rapid pace.

9,What Kind Of Shareholders Own American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL)? - Simply Wall St News,What Kind Of Shareholders Own American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL)?. What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Airlines,"If you want to know who really controls American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership. American Airlines Group has a market capitalization of US$12b, so it's too big to fly under the radar. We'd expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it's seems that institutions own shares in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about AAL. View our latest analysis for American Airlines Group Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors own 71% of American Airlines Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at American Airlines Group's earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in American Airlines Group. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in American Airlines Group Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$147m. I sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling.

10,Should Singapore Airlines Limited’s (SGX:C6L) Weak Investment Returns Worry You? - Simply Wall St News,Should Singapore Airlines Limited’s (SGX:C6L) Weak Investment Returns Worry You?. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE). How Do You Calculate,"Today we are going to look at Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) to see whether it might be an attractive investment prospect. Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires. Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE. ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'. Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) Or for Singapore Airlines: 0.045 = S$1.1b ÷ (S$32b - S$8.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.) So, Singapore Airlines has an ROCE of 4.5%. Check out our latest analysis for Singapore Airlines When making comparisons between similar businesses, investors may find ROCE useful. Using our data, Singapore Airlines's ROCE appears to be significantly below the 6.3% average in the Airlines industry. This performance could be negative if sustained, as it suggests the business may underperform its industry. Putting aside Singapore Airlines's performance relative to its industry, its ROCE in absolute terms is poor - considering the risk of owning stocks compared to government bonds. It is likely that there are more attractive prospects out there.  It is important to remember that ROCE shows past performance, and is not necessarily predictive. Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company. Current liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes","Sep 10, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/sg/transportation/sgx-c6l/singapore-airlines-shares/news/should-singapore-airlines-limiteds-sgxc6l-weak-investment-returns-worry-you-2
11,Investment Lessons 18 Years After the 9/11 Attacks - TheStreet,. . Investment Lessons 18 Years After the 9/11 Attacks. 10 Best Stocks in the Dow This Past Week: McDonald's,"iStock   I'm not faulting the more than 100 million U.S. residents who either hadn't even been born on that fateful day, or who were too young to be aware of what was happening. But the rest of us have no excuse. And it's inevitable that, someday, there will be another crisis of the magnitude of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  That's a remarkably quick recovery from one of the most traumatic events in U.S. history. But it is consistent with how the markets fared following prior geopolitical crises, according to analysis conducted by Ned Davis Research. The firm studied what it considered to be the 28 worst crises over the six decades prior to the 9/11 attacks, and found that, on average within six months, the Dow was higher than where it stood the day before those crises erupted. Perhaps the most remarkable illustration of this recovery phenomenon, though, is how the airline industry fared after the 9/11 attacks. That industry was perhaps the most impacted of any, with many people swearing off ever flying again. Many individual airlines were forced to rely on government bailouts or seek bankruptcy protection. Nevertheless, as you can see from the accompanying chart, the airline industry (as measured by the NYSE Arca Airline Index) by March 2002 was essentially back to where it stood on the day before the terrorist attacks. That's in just six months. To be sure, the markets don't always recover so quickly and impressively from a crisis. In nine of the 28 crises in the Ned Davis study, for example, the market in six months' time had failed to climb back to where it stood prior to the crisis. But even if a quick recovery is not guaranteed, you can be assured that selling into a market panic will secure you some of the worst possible sale prices. The best advice is that, if you didn't get out before the crisis hit the market, you should simply sit on your hands and wait. I acknowledge that it is unseemly to even be discussing your portfolio net worth in the context of a tragedy that led to immeasurable human loss and suffering. But think about it this way: You help no one during any crisis by thinking about your portfolio. And the message of history is that you don't have to.","Sep 10, 2019",https://www.thestreet.com/markets/investment-lessons-18-years-after-the-9-11-attacks-15083451

Kirkland Lake rose 2.8 per cent at 9:50 a.m. in Toronto after the announcement late Friday; Husky Energy Inc. was removed in the changes. S&P Dow Jones is still set to announce the changes for the TSX composite on Sept. 13.

Expect CannTrust Holdings Inc. to be among those ejected from the composite index after it fell beneath its listing price of $2.50. Kirkland Lake has soared 80 per cent this year amid gold’s safe-haven rally and is up 675 per cent over three years. Air Canada had climbed more than 300 per cent since 2016 and is the best-performing stock in the Bloomberg World Airlines Index this year. The carrier’s performance has been boosted this year by its planned acquisition of tour operator Transat AT, which will accelerate its global presence in the leisure industry.

Below, he explains why, despite its flaws, United is often his first choice. Related: TPG Special Report: The 2019 List of Best and Worst U.S. Airlines No airline is perfect — at home or abroad — but in my years of business travel, I’ve found more to like about United Airlines and the Star Alliance than the other major U.S. carriers and international groups. I’m not going to argue that United is the best U.S. airline, overall, but it has been the best fit for me. Most frequent flyers end up choosing an airline based primarily on convenience — proximity to the hub and nonstop destinations. When it comes to United, that’s been the most significant factor for me. As a Lower Manhattan resident, without traffic ahead of an early-morning flight, I can get to Terminal C in roughly 20 minutes, and once I’m there, I can get to most of the places I visit without a stop. And Terminal C is far more comfortable to travel through these days, especially if I have time for a pre-flight stop at Classified. Sure, there’s been some criticism of United’s new seat — it can feel a bit tight to larger flyers — but as a traveler of average size, I find it to",23 hours ago,https://thepointsguy.com/news/battle-airlines-why-united-airlines-is-the-best/

By: Josiah Wilmoth | Email | Leave a comment The Dow Jones Industrial Average lurched lower on Monday afternoon, erasing a triple-digit gain and placing its three-day winning streak at risk. The Dow had climbed as high as 26,900.83 during the morning session, leaving the stock market’s bellwether index less than 500 points away from setting a new all-time high. However, the DJIA swerved lower heading into midday, briefly sliding into decline before bouncing back above its previous session close. As of 2:01 pm ET, the Dow had gained 18.55 points or 0.07%. The index last traded at 26,816.01. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also turned negative – and stayed there – falling 0.11% to 2,975.27 and 0.41% to 8,069.82. There was no clear catalyst for the market’s downward swing, but the Dow’s bull case was not helped by weakness in its most heavily weighted stock: Boeing. The US aerospace giant abruptly halted testing of its 777X aircraft over the weekend, citing an “issue” during the plan’s final load testing. According to the Seattle Times, the 777X test model’s cargo door “exploded outward” during a high-pressure stress test on the ground. The 777X had already been delayed due to issues with its GE-9X engine, forcing it to remain grounded until 2020. With testing now suspended indefinitely, it’s unclear when the 777X will finally enter service. That’s terrible news for Boeing, which continues to suffer from the ongoing 737 MAX scandal. BA shares fell 0.9% to $359.58. Other major Dow stocks reporting significant declines","Sep 9, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/dow-lurches-lower-as-boeing-scandal-takes-explosive-twist/
