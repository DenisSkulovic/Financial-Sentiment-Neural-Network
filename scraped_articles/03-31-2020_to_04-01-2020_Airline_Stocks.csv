Here’s BofA’s List of 4 Enterprise Software,"  Airline stocks rallied last week on hopes that a bailout package will keep the industry aloft. Still, the industry is facing an unprecedented demand shock, and some analysts are warning of even more downside if travel doesn’t pick up soon. In fact, that selloff might have already begun. It’s certainly a bad day for airline stocks. Delta Air Lines (DAL) has dropped 12%, United Airlines Holdings (UAL) has fallen 11%, and American Airlines (AAL) has declined 8.6%. The shares of the three major airlines are down more than 55%... This has been a big year for software stocks, but there may well be further gains ahead.

2,3 Aviation Stocks to Put on the Radar,3 Aviation Stocks to Put on the Radar. Washington provides the industry a $50 billion bailout. American Airlines Group Inc.,"Strict social distancing measures coupled with a raft of state lockdowns aimed at reducing the spread of coronavirus have all but grounded the aviation industry. To combat plunging air travel demand, Washington has, so far, allocated the group over $50 billion in federal aid as part of the historic $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES). The aviation aid package provides $25 million in loans and secures thousands of jobs within the industry by giving airlines access to $25 billion in grants to pay workers through September. It also offers an additional $4 billion to freight carriers. ""Essentially, the U.S. government is providing funds to motivate airlines to continue air service and not involuntarily furlough any team members through a period of incredibly low demand for air travel,"" said American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) CEO Doug Parker, per usatoday.com. Although the three leading aviation stocks outlined below have had their wings severely clipped by the pandemic, a backstop of government assistance should ensure their future survival. Let's take a closer look at each name and analyze the charts to find suitable buying levels. With a market capitalization of $5.19 billion, American Airlines operates as a network air carrier, servicing more than 350 destinations in 50 countries. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline has cut its international flights by 75% and domestic services by 30% to combat the steep decline in passenger numbers. It has also grounded hundreds of its planes and asked employees to take up to 12 months of unpaid leave. The iconic carrier said that it is eligible for $12 billion of the $50 billion aviation aid package. As of April 1, 2020, American Airlines issues a 3.27% dividend yield and has crashed 57.15% year to date (YTD). Since breaking below crucial support in late February, the stock continued to move sharply lower in early March before staging an impressive 72% rally toward the end of the month. As prices retrace from this oversold bounce, investors should look for entry points near $10, where the previous low should provide key support. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States and globally, with the airline flying to over 325 locations in 60 countries. The Atlanta-based carrier has parked 600 planes and slashed its flight schedule by around 70% to help ride out the COVID-19 pandemic.

4,Why Shares of Airlines Are Climbing Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Shares of Airlines Are Climbing Today. With the bailout secured, investors aren't sure how to value airlines right now..","   Investors in airline stocks continue to waver on the industry following the passage of a $2 trillion economic stimulus bill that includes $50 billion for passenger carriers. The stocks rallied last week but were down on Monday, only to bounce back Tuesday as more details trickle out about how the airlines are going to cope with the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic-induced travel slowdown. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) led the way on Tuesday, up 10% at noon, with shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) all up more than 5%. The airline sector has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, with travel demand all but evaporating overnight. A Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spokesperson said Tuesday that on Monday, the agency screened 154,080 passengers nationwide, the lowest single day in 10 years. By comparison, on March 30, 2019, the TSA screened 2,360,053 people. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Most airline stocks lost more than half of their value in the first three weeks of March before stabilizing as lawmakers in Washington agreed on an assistance package that includes $25 billion in grants and $25 billion in loan guarantees to help get the industry through this slowdown. The airlines have until Friday to apply for the assistance, with American already telegraphing its intention to seek relief and other carriers expected to follow. Markets are now going back and forth on the sector, with investors both growing increasingly confident the airlines have the financial firepower to weather a multimonth storm but also worried about how quickly demand might return. United has warned workers that the assistance is likely only enough to get it through the summer, saying if demand doesn't return it would consider furloughs after Sept. 30. On Tuesday, the news flow was mostly positive, with the Department of Transportation signaling it will be flexible when enforcing rules requiring the airlines to sustain service to all markets in return for the assistance. The good news for investors is that after enduring weeks of seemingly daily double-digit declines, the stocks have stabilized somewhat. The bad news is that until the pandemic is under control and we have some idea of how quickly the economy will bounce back, and with it air travel, it is going to be hard for these stocks to really take off.

5,Why Airline Shares Are Down Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Down Today. How long will the travel slowdown last?. What happened. So what. Now what. Should,"   Shares of airlines are losing altitude again on Wednesday, under pressure following a somber news conference Tuesday night in which President Donald Trump warned of a long, drawn-out battle against the novel coronavirus. Time is of the essence for airlines now that the industry has won government support to tide it over until the fall. Shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) each traded down more than 10% at 11:30 a.m., with shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) all down more than 5%. The airline industry's woes are by now well known: The pandemic has brought global travel to a halt, starving these high-fixed-cost businesses of revenue for a long time. The U.S. government last week stepped in to help, providing up to $50 billion in support as part of the $2 trillion economic stimulus package. That buys the industry time, with United and American already telling employees the extra funding will allow them to avoid layoffs through September. But United did note that it can not sustain its current footprint indefinitely, with CEO Oscar Munoz saying in a letter to employees that ""if the recovery is as slow as we fear, it means our airline and our workforce will have to be smaller than it is today."" IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. With the assistance package in place, airline investors are now trying to figure out how long the pandemic will last and how long the economy will suffer. President Trump in comments Tuesday night doused hopes of a quick recovery, saying, ""This is going to be a painful two weeks."" Deborah Birx, one of the scientists on the White House coronavirus task force, during the same news conference said that more than 100,000 Americans could die from the virus even with the most stringent mitigation measures in place. Those estimates put the markets under pressure on Wednesday and had airline investors concerned there is little hope for a quick turnaround. It's a delicate time to be an airline investor. Thanks to the bailout package we can say with some certainty that there is not going to be a near-term U.S. bankruptcy, but there is significant uncertainty about what the future holds for the industry. I remain bullish about long-term travel trends, and optimistic that travel will at least return to more normal recessionary levels by","Apr 1, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/01/why-airline-shares-are-down-today.aspx
6,American Airlines Stock Is a Bargain Buy That Will Fly Again | InvestorPlace,"American Airlines Stock Is a Bargain Buy That Will Fly Again. The fleets won't be grounded forever, and AAL will"," Global markets are in the throes of the mother of all corrections. Stocks have never fallen so fast, or from such heights. And the airline industry is the poster child for this shake up of global economies. Airline stocks like American Airlines (NYSE:AAL) who were profitable just a few weeks ago, now are asking for handouts just to continue existing.  Through no fault of its own, AAL stock finds itself at 2008 levels , a dizzying 70% down from recent highs. But it isn’t alone: Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) are in a similar jam as travel around the globe freezes. Hardly anyone is flying now, so AAL’s income statement is essentially useless beyond the negative journal entries. But unlike in 2008, this is a self-imposed stop to travel that will be lifted soon. The freeze isn’t due to demand collapse but rather a halt by choice of quarantine. But you’ll need a stomach of steel to withstand the selling pressure that these stocks have been and will be suffering this year. The industry is suffering tremendous losses as their planes are grounded while the fixed operating costs pile up. Consequently, industry competitors are considering consolidating flights among airlines. Under normal circumstances this would be illegal but the authorities will look the other way if it comes to it. What investors want to know now is if this is an opportunity to buy into AAL stock. Looking long-term, yes. People will have to fly again, so buying this stock near 2008 levels is sane. The political debate is now over whether or not to bailout airlines. Their problems really started last year with the grounding of the Boeing’s (NYSE:BA) 737 Max model. American had already sidelined its Max models through June but this is an added wrinkle that extends to most of its fleet. So AAL stock will remain hobbled for months or until the virus goes into remission. These are great American companies and it would be shameful if the government will let them fail. While there is no imminent risk of that, the current situation doesn’t look like it’s going to end anytime soon. So there better be steps taken to avert the potential disaster. We don’t need a Lehman moment for the airline industry, and I think the authorities learned their lesson in 2008. Our government has already showed its commitment to","Mar 31, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/03/aal-stock-is-a-bargain-buy-that-will-fly-again/
7,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway took a $5 billion hit on its airline stocks last quarter | Markets Insider,. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway took a $5 billion hit on its airline stocks last quarter. SHARE THIS POST. Your,"   Getty Images / Bill Pugliano  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway probably saw $5 billion wiped off the value of its airline holdings in the first quarter as the novel coronavirus deterred people from flying and forced authorities to halt flights. The famed investor's conglomerate owns between 8% and 11% of the big four US airlines — American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines — assuming its holdings haven't changed since December 31, the date of its last portfolio disclosure. The quartet's market capitalizations fell by an average of 52% in the first three months of 2020. United stock plunged 65%, while American and Delta shares more than halved in value. Southwest, down 35%, was the relative outperformer.  Read more: Buy these 14 stocks flush with the cash reserves to survive a prolonged coronavirus crisis, BTIG says The declines slashed the value of Berkshire's airline holdings by $5 billion. The conglomerate lost $2 billion on Delta and more than $1 billion on both United and American. Buffett famously invests for the long term, so he's unlikely to be worried by the dramatic declines. In fact, he bought another $45 million worth of Delta stock in early March, after the airline's shares plunged 20% in the space of a week. The value investor may be looking to spend more of Berkshire's $128 billion cash pile on airlines.

8,Primecap Can Ride Out Its Airline Stocks' Turbulence | Morningstar,Primecap Can Ride Out Its Airline Stocks' Turbulence. SHARE THIS ARTICLE. Sponsor Center. Site Index,"The firm has been here before. The coronavirus’ economic fallout has hit investors in airline stocks especially hard, perhaps none more so than Pasadena-based Primecap Management Company. At year-end 2019, Primecap firmwide owned 14% to 16% of the shares outstanding in three different airlines and stakes in nine other air carriers. As Exhibit 1 shows, shares of each of these airlines shed between 40.7% and 76.1% during the depths of this still-unfolding bear market (Feb. 20, 2020, to March 23, 2020), versus a 33.8% drop for the S&P 500 index.  Not a single Primecap open-end fund escaped the carnage. All six had at least two airline stocks among its top 20 holdings at year-end 2019, with total exposure for each ranging from about 7% to 11%. The magnitude of Primecap's industry bet becomes apparent through the peer group comparisons depicted in Exhibit 2. Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth’s (POAGX) 10.75% stake, for example, was the highest out of roughly 180 mid-cap growth Morningstar Category peers and more than double its closest rival.  The funds owned some biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and food staples and retailing stocks that held up relatively well, and some even rose. For example, Primecap  Odyssey Aggressive Growth and Vanguard Capital Opportunity (VHCOX) both benefited from modest positions in the German biotech company BioNTech (BNTX), whose shares shot up 59.1% during the bear market so far, thanks to enthusiasm about its partnership with Pfizer (PFE) to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Yet Exhibit 3 shows that wasn’t enough to rescue the lineup from disappointing performance, which helpings of cruise lines like Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Carnival (CCL) exacerbated.  This rough patch hasn’t impaired the Primecap lineup’s long-term record, though. Over the trailing 15 years through March 27, 2020, each fund has outpaced most of its peers, and four of the six have beaten all relevant benchmarks, as have the two funds, Vanguard Primecap (VPMCX) and Vanguard Capital Opportunity, with 20-year track records.  Those 20-year records include three bear markets and periods when Primecap's long-standing penchant for airline stocks wreaked havoc on the firm’s results. Vanguard Primecap and Vanguard Capital Opportunity had 7.7% and 7.4% stakes, respectively, in several of the same airline companies or their predecessors before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which set many carriers on paths to bankruptcy. The managers sold two airline holdings then but held fast on the other positions,","Mar 31, 2020",https://www.morningstar.com/articles/975151/primecap-can-ride-out-its-airline-stocks-turbulence

EasyJet grounds entire fleet.,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Matthew Dumigan | Tuesday, 31st March, 2020 | More on: EZJ IAG As Covid-19 continues to lead countries around the world to place restrictions on international travel, air traffic has dried up. This spells disaster for airline stocks listed in the FTSE 100. As a result, budget airline operator easyJet (LSE: EZJ) took the decision to ground its entire fleet on Monday. Inevitably, the company’s share price took another hit as markets digested the news. This now amounts to around a 60% plummet in the share price since the start of the year. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Other airline stocks such as International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE: IAG), Ryanair, Wizz Air, and TUI AG have followed a similar path. Does this monumental price decrease signal that now is a good time to buy in? Last week The Financial Times reported that, according to the head of IAG, there’s no guarantee that many European airlines will survive this crisis. Income streams are beginning to dry up and more pressure is being placed on already strained cash flows to ensure survival. Companies will soon be in need of government support. In fact, Virgin Atlantic has already asked the government for a bailout. IATA, the industry association of the world’s airlines, has forecasted revenues will drop to nearly half in 2020. As a result of the unfolding pandemic, governments around the world will be called upon to save their crisis-hit airlines. With that in mind, no investor wants to pile into a company that’s about to go under. It’s for this reason that I’d exercise extreme caution when it comes to investing in airline stocks at the moment. The dirt-cheap valuations that the easyJet and IAG are trading on right now is an inviting prospect for value investors. Price-to-earnings ratios are at all-time lows in the FTSE 100 among the airline stocks.

T Sligo | Wednesday, 1st April, 2020 | More on: EZJ In an aviation industry that has been struggling for some time, easyJet (LSE: EZJ) looked different. Airlines like Flybmi and Wow Air failed, and the future for others in the industry was uncertain. In 2019, the easyJet share price rose roughly 24%. And then the coronavirus crisis happened.

According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Following this news, as you would expect, aviation stock prices were some of the hardest hit. International Consolidated Airlines‘ share price has slumped by roughly 65% in the year-to-date. By comparison, the FTSE 100 has fallen by 25% during the same period. As demand plummets, some airlines have taken to suspending flights. Contrarian investors may be thinking this is the time to buy big when it comes to airline stocks. They may sense that as people are fearful of buying these shares, now is the time to be greedy. Let’s take a look at one airline that could represent a great buying opportunity. As you can imagine, running an airline swallows a huge amount of capital. If the demand is not there, then the only realistic option is to ground the planes. Without cash flow, and with a large amount of expenditure, it does not make sense for some airlines to continue flying. This is the action that easyJet chose to take at the start of the week, by grounding its entire fleet of planes. easyJet announced that it had collaboratively come to an agreement with Unite, the union, on furlough arrangements for its cabin crew, effective from 1 April. This will be for a period of two months, and the group has announced that 80% of the crew’s average pay will be paid through the Government’s job retention scheme. No debt refinancing is due until 2022.

That goes for most of the travel and hospitality space as well. Even after its recent bounce, DAL stock is still 53% from its 52-week high. Source: NextNewMedia / Shutterstock.com At what point does all of this panic become an opportunity? For Delta and other airlines, that’s a very difficult question to answer because the situation continues to evolve. There are many unknowns and moving parts with the coronavirus and the airline sector. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 30 Stocks on a Deathwatch How will the former ultimately impact the economy? How will the latter look after federal aid relief? It’s not a secret to investors that the coronavirus has depressed global and domestic air travel. With President Donald Trump recently extending the social distancing guidelines until April 30 and with the U.S. now having the most COVID-19 cases, it’s unlikely consumers will be flocking to the airport anytime soon. Airlines have become easy for the public to attack. Because the industry spent so much of its free cash flow on buybacks (with some reports as high as 96%), it’s understandable why many don’t want them to be bailed out. Critics should be aware that, while the industry spent billions on buybacks, virtually no business was preparing for such a slowdown in such a short amount of time. Unlike a regular recession, the global economy did not ease on the brakes — it slammed on the brakes with both feet. That sudden disappearance of cash flow is dealing a swift blow to many companies, Delta included. At the end of the day, air travel isn’t going away. The industry will receive federal aid as a part of the $2.2 trillion stimulus plan signed on March 27. The move should ensure that the industry stays upright in these difficult times and ultimately removes some risk for the group.

GBP/USD. USD/JPY.,"                                                    By Tracy Rucinski CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc <AAL.O> is set to sharply increase the number of jets it is planning to retire beyond its announced plans as it accelerates a fleet transformation to respond to the coronavirus crisis, people familiar with the matter said. Some 4,700 jets have been parked globally as airlines slash operations due to travel restrictions, according to Ascend by Cirium fleet data, and American's decision confirms industry speculation that many of those older jets will not fly again. In addition to the retirement of 34 Boeing Co <BA.N> 757s and 17 Boeing 767s announced just two weeks ago, American now plans to also sunset a batch of 76 Boeing 737s it acquired between 1999 and 2001, nine Airbus SE <AIR.PA> A330-300s and 20 Embraer E190s, the people said. The plans were announced by President Robert Isom in a video Q&A with employees on Sunday, where he said the arrival of new Boeing 737 MAX jets, expected later this year after a prolonged global grounding, could help facilitate the retirement of older jets that would be in need of heavy maintenance. American is also considering retiring some of its 50-seat regional jets, he said. American said on March 12 it was accelerating the retirement of its remaining Boeing 757s and 767s as it looks at removing older, less fuel-efficient aircraft from its fleet. ""Decisions beyond the 757 and 767 have yet to be finalized, and we continue to make refinements to our overall fleet plan,"" American spokesman Ross Feinstein said, adding that decisions would be based on demand. Airlines around the world have slashed capacity and even the planes flying are nearly empty. Data firm OAG said the aviation industry was less than half the size it was in mid-January, just before countries started confirming coronavirus cases outside China. Aside from heavy maintenance needs on the A330-300s and some of the 737s, American was also facing retrofitting costs on some of the 737s.
