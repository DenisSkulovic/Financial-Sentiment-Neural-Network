0,Is American Airlines Stock a Buy? | The Motley Fool,Is American Airlines Stock a Buy?. Shares of American are down big in 2020. Does that make the stock a,"   It's been a tough year for airline stocks, and few carriers have experienced more turbulence than American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL). American shares lost 60% of their value during a five-week period beginning in mid-February, as COVID-19 fears swept the globe. The stock at times has acted like a volatile penny stock in the months since, as investors search for signs of a turnaround.  AMERICAN AIRLINES YEAR-TO-DATE STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. American Airlines stock is certainly more affordable now than it was heading into the year. But just because the shares are inexpensive, that doesn't make them a bargain. Here's a look at whether American Airlines is a good buy today. American posted an adjusted net loss of $3.4 billion in the second quarter, on revenue that was down 86.4% year over year. The airline's drop in revenue was hardly better than declines posted by rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, despite American moving more quickly than competitors to restore service late in the quarter in response to an uptick in demand. Traffic has rebounded from March and April lows but still is off about 70% year over year, according to Transportation Security Administration statistics, and is unlikely to shoot up any time soon. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. Most of the demand right now is coming from vacationers and other leisure travelers. American, with several hubs in the Sun Belt (in Charlotte, Miami, Dallas, and Phoenix), is well-positioned to soak up that demand. But as the summer ends, that demand will evaporate. With businesses working from home and travel budgets slashed, there isn't much out there to fill the hole. In July, American Airlines notified 25,000 employees -- about 20% of its total workforce -- of possible layoffs. Additionally, the company said recently that it is planning to cut service to at least 15 cities after government funding provided as part of the CARES Act expires on Sept. 30. Demand is likely to be anemic until there is a generally-available COVID-19 vaccine, which is likely not until the second quarter of 2021 at the earliest. And even when there is a vaccine, it's hard to know what the economy will look like and how quickly lucrative business travel will return. American ended the second quarter with over $10 billion of liquidity, but a significant portion of that comes from new borrowings.

1,Southwest Airlines' Cash Burn Ticks Down Again | The Motley Fool,Southwest Airlines' Cash Burn Ticks Down Again. The popular low-fare airline keeps proving that it has what it takes to,"   There's no end to the COVID-19 pandemic in sight. As a result, air travel demand hasn't improved much following a steep drop earlier this year. In recent days, passenger throughput at TSA checkpoints has averaged less than 30% of year-ago levels -- despite widespread availability of bargain airfares during what would usually be the peak summer travel season. In this environment, U.S. airlines have had to focus on what they can control. Most notably, that includes minimizing cash burn and bolstering their balance sheet flexibility. Last week, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) gave shareholders good news on both fronts. Back in April, Southwest Airlines projected that core cash burn would average between $30 million and $35 million a day in the second quarter of 2020. Fortunately, solid cost performance and an uptick in bookings (especially in June) allowed it to beat that forecast. Daily cash burn slowed from $30 million in April to just $16 million by June, putting average daily cash burn for the full quarter at $23 million. In conjunction with Southwest's Q2 earnings report last month, management said that third-quarter cash burn would likely be in line with the company's second-quarter result, largely due to a slowdown in bookings during July as COVID-19 case numbers surged. Fortunately, a modest decline in reported new cases in recent weeks has paved the way for increased bookings, bolstering cash flow. On Wednesday, Southwest Airlines said it expects August revenue to be at the high end of its previous guidance range, albeit still down 70% to 75% year over year. Furthermore, based on recent booking activity, it expects modest sequential improvement in September, with revenue down 65% to 75% year over year. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. Meanwhile, Southwest has been steadily paring back its flight schedules since the initial uptick in bookings petered out in July. The airline now expects Q3 capacity to be down 30% to 35% year over year, compared to its initial forecast of a 20% to 30% decrease. The combination of stronger booking activity and fewer flights is good for cash flow. Southwest says that daily core cash burn averaged about $17 million in July -- $1 million better than its initial expectation. Moreover, the company reduced its estimate for Q3 daily core cash burn to $20 million from $23 million previously. Southwest Airlines entered 2020 with the best balance sheet in the U.S. airline industry","Aug 22, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/22/southwest-airlines-cash-burn-ticks-down-again/

3,UAL Stock Is Not the Best Airline Stock to Buy Right Now | InvestorPlace,Buy These Airlines Instead of United Airlines Stock. UAL stock just doesn't stack up as attractively as other airlines. The," Truth be told, if there’s a rally in the airline industry, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is going higher. In fact, UAL stock may even be one of the better performers in a strong rally.  The same goes for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). These two have been some of the worst performers in the group. So if and when there is a rally, these stocks are likely to have stronger recoveries on the upside.  Despite that, I don’t want to own United or American. Instead, I would rather be with higher quality names like Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) or Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE).  Spirit has been one of the worst performers in the group from a stock perspective. Despite that, the company  drastically cut down its cash burn and will likely be one of the first to turn profitable when business returns to the airlines.  Southwest has one of the strongest balance sheets in the group. When there are times of uncertainty, investors are drawn to certainty. In this case, strong balance sheets translate to certainty, which is why Southwest stock boasts the best year-to-date return (down 37%) of the group.  The next best performer? Delta, which is down 53%. That says a lot about how much better LUV stock is doing than its peers.  In any regard though, the airline industry is under immense pressure. While TSA checkpoint traffic rebounded sharply from the April lows through June, we’ve seen it plateau since July. There have been two days of upward spikes in traffic this month, but nothing that suggests the trend is changing.  This image is a visual for that TSA traffic reference. As you can see, there just isn’t any momentum to the upside. Perhaps that will change with a dip in novel coronavirus cases. But what if the case count increases? Will traffic dip again or will it remain resilient?  The bigger question is, how long will it take for the airline industry to recover? Delta’s management says a few years. United said it “expects demand to remain suppressed until the availability of a widely accepted treatment and/or vaccine for COVID-19.” When United Airlines reported earnings in July, the company suffered an 87% decline in revenue. That’s about in-line with its peers. United called it “the most difficult financial quarter in its 94-year history,” as it reported an","Aug 23, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/buy-these-airlines-instead-of-united-airlines-ual-stock/

5,Why Is American Airlines (AAL) Up 3.3% Since Last Earnings Report?,. . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD.,"                                                   A month has gone by since the last earnings report for American Airlines (AAL). Shares have added about 3.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is American Airlines due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. American Airlines Incurs Loss in Q2 American Airlines incurred a loss (excluding $3 from non-recurring items) of $7.82 per share, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $6.75. However, the company delivered earnings per share of $1.82 in the year-ago quarter. Results in the second quarter were hurt by the coronavirus-induced air-travel demand woes.

Operating revenues of $1,622 million slumped 86.4% year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,481.1 million. Passenger revenues, which accounted for bulk of the top line (68.3%), plunged 89.9% to $1,108 million. Cargo revenues also declined 41% to $130 million, mainly due to 72.6% lower cargo ton miles. Other revenues dropped 47.2% as well.

Total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) decreased 42.6% to 9.5 cents in the reported quarter. Passenger revenue per available seat miles (PRASM) fell 57.4% to 6.48 cents in the period. Moreover, consolidated yield was down 12.8%.

While consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) plummeted 88.5%, capacity (measured in average seat miles) contracted 76.4%. Consolidated load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) decreased 44.3 percentage points to 42.3% as traffic decline was more than capacity reduction.

Total operating costs (on a reported basis) declined 62% year over year to $4,108 million with expenses pertaining to aircraft fuel and related taxes tumbling 89.1%. Consolidated operating costs per available seat mile (CASM: excluding fuel and special items) skyrocketed more than 100% to 32.04 cents due to weak capacity. With major part of the fleet remaining grounded/under-utilized, fuel gallons consumed tanked 76.3% to 275 million.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is set to announce on Monday it will issue an emergency exemption to the state of Texas permitting it to allow American Airlines Group Inc <AAL.O> to use a new surface coating that kills coronaviruses for up to seven days, sources briefed on the matter said. EPA officials said the agency would approve the emergency exemption requests under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to allow the use of SurfaceWise2 — a product manufactured by Allied BioScience Inc - by both American Airlines and Texas-based Total Orthopedics Sports & Spine's two clinics for up to a year. American Airlines declined to comment. The announcement comes as airlines are struggling to convince people that it is safe to resume flying. EPA officials said the product was aimed at providing added protection in public spaces that could increase consumer confidence in resuming air travel. EPA officials said the surface coating inactivated viruses and bacteria within two hours of application and kept working against them for up to seven days. The EPA will allow the product's use at American Airlines airport facilities in Texas and on planes with flights originating in the state, the officials said, without providing more details. The initial application and any reapplication must occur in Texas. Allied BioScience plans to pursue a non-emergency approval by submitting additional data to meet the EPA’s registration requirements as an antiviral surface coating. If approved, the product would become available for purchase by the public, EPA officials said. EPA officials emphasized the product was not a replacement for routine cleaning and disinfection. Facilities must continue to get regular cleanings. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it may be possible for a person to get COVID-19 ""by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 378.13 points, or 1.4%, to close at 28,308.46. The S&P 500 climbed 1% to 3,431.28 and hit an all-time high. Monday also marked the S&P 500′s first-ever close above 3,400. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6% to 11,379.72 and also reached a record.  Apple shares rose 1.2% to lead other tech-related names higher. Facebook climbed 1.6% and Amazon advanced 0.7%. Alphabet rose 0.6%. Shares of airlines and cruise operators gained amid positive coronavirus treatment developments. United Airlines rose by more than 9% along with American. Delta gained 9.3%. Carnival advanced 10.2%. Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean closed higher by 7.6% and 4.7%, respectively.  Monday’s moves came as the number of new coronavirus cases continues to decline in the U.S. Since spiking to more than 64,000 cases earlier this month, the number of new daily infections in the U.S. has not topped 49,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. On Sunday, there were less than 37,000 new confirmed cases, the data showed.  “I think something interesting may evolve in the weeks and months ahead,” said Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, in a note. “I think it is entirely possible that USA COVID-19 cases crash to sub-10,000 in September.” “The US is soon becoming one of the safest places in the World. And if this is true, capital will also want to seek the US,” which means “stocks rise further,” Lee said.  On Sunday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization of convalescent plasma for hospitalized Covid-19 patients, a treatment that uses blood plasma donated by people who’ve recovered from the virus. President Donald Trump said at a news conference Sunday that the plasma treatment cuts the mortality rate by 35%. However, results of the study by the Mayo Clinic that the FDA cited in its authorization of the treatment indicates that patients below age 80 who were not on a respirator and received plasma with a high level of antibodies within three days of diagnosis were about 35% more likely to survive another 30 days compared with patients who received plasma with a low level of antibodies.

8,Warren Buffett & The Unpredictability Of Stock Markets | by moneyguru | Guru Gyan | Medium,Warren Buffett & The Unpredictability Of Stock Markets. The Sudden Shift. The Aviation Bet. . . moneyguru. Your Best Direct,"In today’s article, we wanted to explain something called the Bandwagon Effect and what better place to start than talking about Warren Buffett’s recent change of heart. On August 14, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased nearly 21 million shares of Barrick Gold worth $563 million, representing 0.3% of Berkshire’s holding. The important thing to note here is that Barrick Gold is a gold mining company based in Canada. This sudden shift matters because Buffett is a value investor. Value investing is an investment strategy that involves choosing stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. Value investors pick those stocks which are being underestimated by the stock market. Since Buffett is a value investor, he saw little to no value in gold, which is why he stayed away from it. Buffett has been vocal about his dislike for the metal. He once stated, “It (gold) doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.” He even went on to say that it “has no utility” and once wrote, “Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head” over how we treat gold on Earth. This is not the first time Buffett has made a U-turn in his investment strategy or statements. After Buffett’s $358 million investment in US Airways didn’t pan out the way he wanted, the ace investor kept his distance from airline stocks. He said, “But seriously, the airline business has been extraordinary. It has eaten up capital over the past century like almost no other business because people seem to keep coming back to it and putting fresh money in.” However, he made a U-turn and bought stocks worth nearly $1.3 billion in four big airline companies in 2016. He made a U-turn again in May 2020 by completely dumping his investments in airline firms. Once Buffett sold all of the airline stocks owned by him, shares of airline companies traded lower. Because everyone was thinking the same thing — If Buffett has sold his investments in airlines, it might mean that airline stocks might not recover at all. The biggest plot twist is that the airline stocks in Wall Street have rallied in the past few months. But what does any of this have to do with the Bandwagon Effect?

References[edit]. Further reading[edit]. External links[edit]. .," Breeze Airways (initially Moxy Airways) is a planned airline in the United States due to begin operations in 2021. The airline was founded by David Neeleman (who previously co-founded Morris Air, WestJet, JetBlue, and Azul Linhas Aereas). In June 2018, Neeleman planned a new United States airline, to be named Moxy, with capital from former Air Canada CEO Robert Milton, former ILFC CEO Henri Courpron, former JetBlue Chairman of the Board Michael Lazarus and himself. They perceived that due to consolidation, all 11 major carriers were profitable and had existed 20 years ago (except JetBlue, which Neeleman had started in 2000) and that there was space for a new competitor.[2] American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines carried 80% of domestic US seats in 2017 and Alaska Airlines, Allegiant, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Hawaiian Airlines and Spirit Airlines made up most of the rest.[3][4] Due to loss of service to smaller markets, U.S. domestic air capacity had remained stagnant from 2007 to 2017 while the economy had expanded by 34%. To fill this perceived gap, Breeze plans to offer point-to-point flights from smaller secondary airports such as T.F. Green Airport (Providence), Fort Worth or Burbank Airport, bypassing hubs for shorter travel times.[5] The airline is also reportedly considering longer distance flights to South America and Europe.[6] It would offer spacious seats and free Wi-Fi, like Azul and JetBlue, but charge fees for snacks and advance seat assignments, like ultra low-cost carriers Allegiant Air or Spirit Airlines. To begin flying operations, 60 Airbus A220-300s (previously known as the Bombardier CS300) were ordered, soliciting Chinese lessors to finance 18 to be delivered from 2021 onward.[5] However, in order to accelerate the airline's launch, Breeze plans to utilize used Azul Embraer E195 aircraft as soon as 2020.[4] On February 7, 2020, it was announced that the airline had now been officially named Breeze Airways.[7] The previous name, Moxy, clashed with Marriott's Moxy Hotels trademark.[8] The airline's branding, such as logo, colors and aircraft livery was developed by the Brazilian airline marketing specialist Gianfranco ""Panda"" Beting, Azul's co-founder and responsible for creating the branding of Azul, TAP Air Portugal and Transbrasil.[9][10] In February 2020, Neeleman expressed the view that the airline would be known as the ""World’s Nicest Airline"".[11] The airline had originally planned to begin operations sometime in 2020 as an acquisition of Compass Airlines, the launch was later pushed","Aug 24, 2020",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeze_Airways

Think About How SIA Was When Times Was “Normal”.,"22 August 2020  Before we got into this COVID-19 mess, SIA is already not a great business to own even when times were “normal.” Source: Morningstar All of us know that the airline business is a very capital intensive business. For SIA, their free cash flow has been negative most of the time in the last five years. That means that after deducting their operating cash flow for capital expenditures, they are left with negative cash flow. Source: Morningstar The truth is very few airlines in the world can consistently produce a positive and growing free cash flow. Southwest Airlines, based in the US is an exception, as you can see from the chart above. Southwest is able to do it because they are able to streamline their operations well – combined with an amazing working culture inside the company.  Source: Ycharts Source: Google  And based on the stock price chart above from 2014-2019, you can see that Southwest has been a better business (and therefore, stock) to own over the last five years as compared to SIA. Based on the same 5-year period, while Southwest is up 179.7%, SIA is down 10.65%. Yes, although we cannot compare directly as they operate in different markets but as investors, we still can choose where to allocate our capital. And as you can see, the stock price reflects the strength of the business that we buy. My fundamental investing philosophy is always, “if the business does well, the stock price will likely do well too.” Hence I would say that as an airline business, I’d rather own Southwest as opposed to SIA. See also: Our free telegram channel. We post daily. SIA is in such a dire state that due to the fund-raising they did, their issued share capital could potentially be diluted by more than 3 times its original share capital. That simply means that if last time they earn $0.30 per share, and if we assume they manage to reach back to the previous net earnings, its earnings per share will be down to about $0.10 due to the dilution. That is such a huge potential dilution in which the full effect we will only know maybe in 2021. Image Source: Wikipedia SIA is an iconic brand.

Individual stock ownership comes with a lot of distinct advantages, provide you are ready and willing to put the requisite time and research behind it. According to Henry To, partner at the Newport Beach, California based CB Capital Partners: “I believe an individual investor absolutely has an advantage over professional investors if he or she is willing to do the homework necessary to understand the company, management, and the industry underlying each individual stock.” With that said, let’s get started.

At Rs 14,98,58,60,00,00,000 mcap, it’s bigger than these countries, 2/3rd of India’s GDP. According to data","Earlier this week Apple became the only second company ever globally and the first US company to cross the $2-trillion market cap milestone after Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil major Saudi Aramco. Founded in 1976, while it took consumer electronics multinational founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, 42 years to hit $1 trillion in value in 2018, the other trillion dollars came in just two years. In fact, according to data from YCharts, Apple’s market cap stood at $981 billion on March 23, 2020. The data showed that Apple got its second $1 trillion in market cap astonishingly in just 21 weeks even as the world economy grappled with the slowdown amid the Covid pandemic. To put Apple’s $2.13 trillion market cap in perspective, the company comparatively is now worth around two-third of India in terms of annual GDP of $3 trillion and nearly 7X of Pakistan’s $278 billion GDP. Apple is also bigger than some of the leading economies globally in terms of GDP such as Italy ($1.9 billion), Brazil ($1.8 billion), Canada ($1.7 billion), Russia ($1.6 billion), Spain ($1.39 billion), Australia ($1.37 billion), according to the 2019 figures by Statista. In Rupees, this metaphor looks even interesting. Apple’s market cap is now Rs 149858600000000 (almost Rs 1.5 crore crores). Even in comparison to the market cap (as on August 21, 2020) of the top five Indian companies combined, Apple is way bigger. Adding up Reliance’s market cap of $182.9 billion followed by $112.5 billion market cap of TCS, $79.6 billion of HDFC Bank, $69 billion of Hindustan Unilever, and $53.9 billion of Infosys, the combined market cap is nearly $500 billion.
