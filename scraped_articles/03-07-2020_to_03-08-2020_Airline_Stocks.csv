1,Should You Buy or Sell Airline Stocks Right Now? | The Motley Fool,Should You Buy or Sell Airline Stocks Right Now?. Coronavirus has sent airline shares tumbling. Is now a good time,"   Airline shares have been decimated by the COVID-19 coronavirus sell-off, with some stocks losing nearly half of their value in the last two weeks alone. And not without reason. As the coronavirus has spread globally, travel demand has plummeted, with United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) saying it saw near-term demand to all of Asia fall by more than 75% when the virus was largely contained to China. The airlines have canceled flights to parts of the world that have been heavily affected, and some, including United and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), have announced plans to scale back service across their entire networks until demand resumes.  AIRLINE STOCKS YEAR TO DATE DATA BY YCHARTS The airline sector has long been highly cyclical, and the downturns have usually been painful for investors. Storied names like Eastern Airlines, TWA, Braniff, and PanAm disappeared from the skies during past downturns. Nothing is certain about the ultimate effects coronavirus will have on the economy at large, and airlines in particular, but it does appear the blow will be substantial. It's a scary time to be holding airline shares. But for those with a long time horizon, and the stomach to handle turbulence, here's why it's a great time to buy. Wall Street tends to be focused on quarterly results, and there is little doubt the coronavirus will affect airline financials at least for the first half of 2020. That could extend into the second half of the year as well. During a TV appearance, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) CEO Gary Kelly said the drop in demand is reminiscent of what happened after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. In years past that might have been enough to permanently ground a U.S. airline, and based on the stock reactions in recent weeks, memories of past crises are weighing heavily on investors this time around. However, the industry has changed dramatically. A period of restructuring and consolidation in the early 2000s reduced the number of airlines competing for business and fortified the balance sheets of the survivors. Today Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), United, and Southwest control about 80% of the U.S. market, giving them unprecedented pricing power.

3,No more refills: U.S. airlines step up measures to guard against coronavirus | Reuters,No more refills: U.S. airlines step up measures to guard against coronavirus. . . . . . . . .,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Tracy Rucinski 3 MIN READ CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are stepping up measures to guard against the spread of coronavirus through person-to-person contamination on airplanes, from eliminating wine and water refills to keeping passengers from touching serving trays and food baskets. Rather than bringing wine or water bottles into the aisles for refills, flight attendants on United Airlines will now provide a new cup or glass. Facing a sharp drop in travel demand due to rising coronavirus outbreaks across the world, airlines are offering travelers free rebooking options while trying to calm jitters about cabin cleanliness and air-circulation systems. In a letter to customers on Saturday, United Airlines Holdings Inc Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said it is “important that we give you as much information as possible about the procedures we follow to clean our aircraft and maintain a sanitary environment once we’re in the air.” In addition to extra cabin-cleaning measures including washing ceilings and scrubbing overhead bins, United said its flight attendants may wear gloves during all food and beverage service and pickup. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines Group Inc have also introduced extra cabin protections, including eliminating self-serve snack and fruit baskets, and all of the carriers are working with airports to regularly disinfect common surfaces like kiosks and ticket counters. Airlines and flight attendant unions have also been retaining infectious disease and aviation medicine experts for town hall meetings with crew members to explain best practices like frequent hand-washing to protect against contracting the virus. “Unfortunately, there is risk involved in this line of work, and exposure to passengers carrying disease is one of those risks,” Dr Kris Belland, a medical adviser for the union representing American Airlines’ flight attendants, said in a letter to crew. There are now 102,000 coronavirus cases and more than 3,480 deaths across the world, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements. Most cases and deaths have been in China but numbers are mounting outside its borders, with around 90 other countries reporting infections. Airline stocks have plummeted as worries about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy have taken hold. On Wall Street, the broad S&P 500 index has dropped more than 12% from its Feb. 19 high, with the NYSE ARCA airline index down nearly 31% over the same time frame.

11,Norwegian Air’s Stock Plummets Over 25% Due to COVID-19 | Airways Magazine,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Norwegian,"MIAMI – Norwegian Air (DY) Shuttle’s stock price plummeted 25% on Friday as a result of analysts estimating the projected losses for the airline in the coming months. This represents the lowest the stock price it has ever been in 15 years.  The airline’s stock prices have dropped over 70 percentage points in the last month. Norwegian has already cut 22 transatlantic flights and is cutting costs to combat the substantially lower demand due to COVID-19 fears. In addition, in order to cut costs, the airline has already halted 15% of all its flights.  Although DY was initially expecting to turn a profit this year, they have since abandoned this expectation due to analysts predicting them to suffer losses in Q1 of this year.  Analysts are anticipating Norwegian to require another equity refill to stay afloat. The equity refill would give the airline a small layer of protection to deal with the fallout.  The airline industry has already been hit incredibly hard due to the coronavirus. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates the fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak will cost airlines upwards of $113bn.  Airways will continue to post detailed reports on the deadly virus fallout and how the epidemic is dramatically affecting the commercial aviation industry.  Despite being the third largest low-cost carrier in Europe (following Ryanair and Easyjet), DY has faced continuous operational hurdles in the past few years.  In the past 10 years, Norwegian has gone through a rapid expansion, leading to it being overstretched.  The airline had many mechanical issues with their Boeing 787-9 fleet’s engines. They also operate 18 Boeing 737 MAX 8’s that are currently all grounded.  In 2018, after a period of extreme growth, the airline decided to switch their goal to profitability instead of growth. To comply with this new strategy, the carrier cancelled their whole order for Airbus a320neo’s.    Do you think that the aviation industry will recover by 2024?

Oil Prices, Stocks Plunge After Saudi Arabia Stuns World With Massive Discounts. . BUSINESS. Dow Dives","AVIE SCHNEIDER CAMILA DOMONOSKE Oil prices dropped 30% Sunday after Saudi Arabia announced it would boost production and cut prices.  Updated at 10:52 p.m. ET Oil prices and stock indexes were in freefall Sunday after Saudi Arabia announced a stunning discount in oil prices — of $6 to $8 per barrel — to its customers in Asia, the United States and Europe. Benchmark Brent crude oil futures dove 30% — the steepest drop since the Gulf War in 1991 — in early trading Sunday night before recovering slightly to a drop of 24%. The benchmark Brent crude oil price fell below $34 per barrel. The oil price shocks reverberated throughout financial markets. Dow futures dropped more than 1,000 points, S&P 500 futures hit their limits after tumbling 5%, and the key 10-year Treasury note yield fell below 0.5%, a record low. Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest producer, this weekend said it will actually boost oil production instead of cutting it to stem falling prices, in a dramatic reversal in policy. Late last week, Saudi Arabia, the rest of OPEC and Russia failed to agree on production cuts to combat falling prices because of fears that the coronavirus epidemic will halt world economic growth. Oil prices were down more than 30% this year before Sunday's collapse. U.S. consumers are likely to see lower prices at the gas pump, but American oil producers — who lead the world in output — could be hurt by the oil price slide. Economies from China to Italy have ground to a halt as quarantines shut down factories and demand for products and services craters. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members sought to cut production to shore up oil prices. But the once-powerful cartel can no longer move markets alone. It needs the support of Russia, which is not an OPEC member but has recently been coordinating with the organization. Yet Russia has resisted calls for production cuts. On Friday, the talks ended in failure. OPEC and its allies announced no new reductions and didn't even commit to extending current cuts. So, Saudi Arabia is doing an about-face. If it can't get the price back up, it's going to drive the price way down. It's offering to cut the oil price for the U.S. market by $7 per barrel, to Europe by $8 and Asia by $6.

13,Want to become rich in Coronavirus hit economy? Top 5 Warren Buffett inspired money-making tips | Zee Business,"Want to become rich in Coronavirus hit economy? Top 5 Warren Buffett inspired money-making tips. Warren Buffet suggests, be greedy"," How to become rich in a very small time is a common question that the majority of the investors ask from their investment advisors. However, very few could achieve their target. Warren Buffet suggests, be greedy when the world is fearful and fearful when the world is greedy. The recent spread of Coronavirus or COVID 19 virus spread is like that. If it is hitting the markets dearly, it is giving a window of opportunity for the investors who believe in taking high risk for higher returns. According to the investment experts, once the effect of Coronavirus is gone from the global economy, quality portfolios are bound to shoot up at a faster rate giving very high returns in a very short time to those who dare to invest in current Coronavirus hit economy.  Speaking on how to make investments in Coronavirus hit economy Hemant Sood, Managing Director, Findoc said, ""Financial market investments are heavily dependent on smart moves and positive market sentiments. Calamities and medical pandemics can dwindle markets beyond control. The global stock market has been tumbling, leading to a sell-off in most of the global bourses. Stock prices are also falling due to the fear that coronavirus will grow into a significant international health crisis. The Indian market too has witnessed a hit due to coronavirus."" He said that, on the hind-side, the greater the risks, the better the profits are for investors, but only for the ones with deep pockets. Retail investors need to be cautious during such situations.   See Zee Business Live TV streaming below:   Sood went on to add that the best policy for a retail investor is to play a long-term game with value stocks to create wealth for the golden years of his life. With the present flu in global markets, retail investors should not take decisions in haste and do the following:  1] Invest in the right stocks: Though the situation is likely to remain transient and temporary, but it is difficult to take a call on market performance. Hence, it is very important to do research. If retail investors have liquidity to invest, it is suggested to wait for the moment and conserve until the end of the global crisis.  In case, one has already made investments, it is suggested not to sell stocks out of hassle and ride out this uncertainty.","Mar 7, 2020",https://www.zeebiz.com/personal-finance/news-want-to-become-rich-in-coronavirus-hit-economy-top-5-warren-buffett-inspired-money-making-tips-121546

VOLATILITY.," At the onset of this market crash, I’d focused on how investing legend Warren Buffett was responding to the crisis. Buffett is no stranger to making big bets on troubled sectors. Back in 2017, Canada housing was in flux. Home Capital Group, one of the top alternative lenders, was facing total collapse. Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway came to Home Capital’s rescue in June of that year. It shares would rebound, and Berkshire bowed out in December 2018. Today, I want to look at another sector that is facing a crisis due to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. How should investors approach airliners right now? Moreover, should they mirror the moves of Buffett? Let’s dive in. Some experts have projected that the early impacts of the coronavirus outbreak could be as damaging as the 9/11 terror attacks were on the airline industry. In that instance, it took roughly half a decade for the industry to return to profitability. Back in January 2019, I’d discussed why airliners were particularly susceptible to economic turbulence. The International Air Transport Association recently projected that global airlines stand to lose $113 billion in sales if the coronavirus continues its rapid spread. This is a vast increase from the IATA’s projection two weeks ago of a $30 billion loss. It illustrates just how quickly the situation can change. The IATA says that airlines could lose 19% of their business if COVID-19 is not contained soon. This ominous projection has inspired many analysts to downgrade airline stocks. However, one of the top minds in the industry has made a big contrarian bet. Bloomberg News recently reported that Warren Buffett acquired more than 976,000 Delta Air Lines shares for approximately $45.3 million, citing a regulatory filing. Berkshire Hathaway first bought Delta shares back in the third quarter of 2016. This swells its holding in the company to over 70 million shares. Delta is the biggest position among airlines, but it also holds significant stock in United Airlines, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines.              Alex Moffat took over the ""SNL"" Joe Biden role in style, nailing a somersault onto the stage the day Jim Carrey announced he wouldn't play the role.

15,Airlines Stock Crisis: Delta Airlines vs Singapore Airlines - Ein55,Airlines Stock Crisis: Delta Airlines vs Singapore Airlines. 2 Free eBooks by Dr Tee (Click to Download),"ein55  Both Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL) and Singapore Airlines (SGX: C6L) are well known international airlines. However, choice of stock for investing is different from choosing airline as a passenger. We need to consider from investing perspective, both business performance and share prices. Delta Airlines is a giant airline stock with strong business fundamental. No wonder Warren Buffett starts to collect more of this stock despite the price falls like a knife which he is not afraid to catch it as he believes the bleeding period is within his tolerance level to exchange for 1/3 discount (26% optimism, near to low optimism <25% but in downtrend direction, Ein55 members may monitor when it may recover again while optimism is still low). Our dear Singapore Airlines is not a giant stock, fundamental is below average, optimism (28%) is approaching low (towards 25%) but long term potential is relatively weaker, more suitable for short term trading (when timing is right), not for investing. Some smart investors select stocks as if choosing life partner, holding for long term to maximize the value of partnership, therefore won’t miss when the rare opportunity has come. However, no one would know the “perfect” moment (eg. the lowest price). For Warren Buffett, he just needs to buy with discount within his acceptable limit, buy low enough, no need to speculate the lowest price and he could hold till recovery in both business and share prices. ==================================

16,Making Sense of Investment Risk | AAII,". . . . . . Making Sense of Investment Risk. by Paul Merriman | March 01, 2020. While you","                Most investors understand the basics of taking risks. We do it every time we buy a security. Almost all the trouble investors get into involves risk. Sometimes it’s taking too much. Sometimes it’s taking too little. Often, it’s failing to even recognize that a particular risk exists. Most people aren’t eager to think about risks. But on that inevitable day when one (or all) of your investments fails to live up to your dreams, you may wish you had paid more attention. Risk comes in various flavors, but they all start with one unavoidable fact: The future is unknown. Some risks are objective, and you can measure them in money. Emotional risks manifest in stress, worry and uncertainty. Behavioral risks—doing the wrong things—can lead to financial losses and emotional stress. I’ll discuss some examples of each in the second half of this article. But first I want to explore the nature of risk, in the hope that this will help us know what to do (and what NOT to do) about it. As an investor, you have no task more important than recognizing and managing risk. But what is “risk,” anyway? One common definition of risk is the probability that any specific investment will decline in value. In the stock market, this happens almost every day, even if the loss is only temporary. Too many investors give all their attention to market risk while they show little concern for other risks that can hurt them much more over time. Back in the late 1980s when Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) had just gone public and Bill Gates was suddenly worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he was asked how often he looked at the company’s stock price. His answer: About once a month. Gates, of course, was making money hand over fist. But he understood that his eye had to be on the ball (doing his job) instead of on the scoreboard (calculating the value of his stock). Much more important than today’s stock prices are your long-term goals, your asset allocation and the recurring costs you are paying—to name just three. Calculating how you are doing does not help you make more money. My own definition of risk is unorthodox, but I think it’s useful: Risk is a possibility, which you invite into your life,","Mar 9, 2020",https://www.aaii.com/latest/article/10905-making-sense-of-investment-risk

She was catching a flight to Dallas. It was Nov. 20, 2018, and she had a meeting with Southwest Airlines, where she had worked as a flight attendant for two decades. But this was no routine trip. Osborne was trying to discover what kind of chemicals were in her uniform – which she says caused her to break out in a rash, irritated her eyes and nose, and left her with scarring. Months after the symptoms first appeared, she underwent two skin biopsies, got a skin patch test, and requested approval for an alternative uniform to the one that was bothering her. Her dermatologist put it this way, according to a medical form Osborne submitted to Southwest that September: If she ""continues to wear the uniform, she will continue to have a severe rash that may reduce her ability to perform her duties.” Over the last decade, flight attendants at several major airlines have said their uniforms are making them sick. They have reported the issues to labor unions, discussed symptoms among one another in a private Facebook group, and laid out their claims in lawsuits. In New York and Wisconsin, suits are pending against Lands’ End, maker of Delta’s “Passport Plum” uniform. In Illinois, American Airlines faces a proposed class-action suit, brought by flight attendants and pilots, which the company has asked a federal judge to dismiss. So far, three air carriers have agreed to replace their uniforms, after complaints. American Airlines, which dominates travel at Philadelphia International Airport, started using new uniforms this month for more than 50,000 employees, and Alaska Airlines is rolling out a new uniform collection this year as well. Delta said in January that it, too, will seek a replacement uniform. Flight attendants at Southwest are also experiencing symptoms they say are linked to uniforms, according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Inquirer. One person was so alarmed about the uniform’s effects on her body that she had a garment tested for heavy metals and toxins by a private lab.

18,"Economic toll of virus sinks in, duration remains an unknown",CORONAVIRUS. RECOMMENDED. General sorry for ‘miscommunication’ over vaccine shipments. Businesses left with bills as states halt virus supply deals. Economic,"Resources The Dow Jones Industrial Average over the past five days: up 1,293, down 785, up 1,173, down 969, down 256. The Dow sank as many as 894 points Friday before recovering much of its losses. The VIX, an index known as Wall Street’s fear barometer, touched levels not seen since the financial crisis. The uncertainty and potential economic damage from the coronavirus deepened this week. Sectors that cater to almost any public activity — movie theaters, business conference organizers, hotels, airlines and amusement parks — have lost billions as investors flee to areas they perceive as safer, like U.S. Treasury notes, which now pay paltry amounts that are far less than inflation. Following is a brief look at how things are changing in the economy and the workplace today as the outbreak widens. HEADWINDS: Germany’s biggest airline, Lufthansa, says it will cut up to 50% of its flights in the next few weeks, depending on how the virus outbreak develops. It said it had seen a drastic drop in reservations, with all regions now affected. Lufthansa, which also owns Swiss airlines and several smaller regional European carriers, operates over 83,000 flights a month. The airline earlier announced plans to cancel all flights to and from Israel for three weeks after Israeli authorities announced tough restrictions on travelers from several countries. The airline industry is among the hardest hit since the outbreak, forcing carriers to reassess their near-term financial expectations. An industry group said the spreading coronavirus could cost airlines as much as $113 billion in lost revenue.
