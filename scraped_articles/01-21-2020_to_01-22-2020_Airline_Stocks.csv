IAG, parent of British Airways, is among the hardest hit in","   Luxury retailers, airlines and casino stocks fell Tuesday after a potentially deadly virus spread between humans in China, spurring concerns that an outbreak may crimp tourism and shopping during the crucial Lunar New Year holiday period. Christian Dior SE CDI -1.18% slipped 2.3% in Paris while Kering SA, owner of the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent brands, dropped 2.1%. International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, the parent of British Airways, retreated 3% in London, part of a broad decline in global airline stocks. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus, which is pneumonialike, tripled Monday, reprising memories of the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. That outbreak led to more than 700 people dying and crimped economic growth in the region. The latest outbreak has spread to neighboring countries, prompting speculation that measures aimed at preventing further proliferation might affect businesses at a critical time in China’s leisure and tourism calendar. The news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.  Chinese consumers have become more important for the global economy and luxury sector in the last two decades as economic growth has bolstered wealth in the country, analysts said. They accounted for 33% of global spending on luxury goods in 2018, according to a study published by consulting firm Bain & Co. in 2019. A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data. “Wealthier Chinese people often go overseas to shop for luxury brands or to Macau for gambling during the Lunar New Year break,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London & Capital Group Ltd. “Luxury brands are now very sensitive to Chinese demand.” The SARS outbreak curbed both travel and luxury spending, said Paola Carboni, an analyst at Equita Group. While the authorities have learned some lessons in containment since then, the timing of the coronavirus—ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday—has made investors especially nervous. Shares in Wynn Resorts Ltd. , which operates hotels globally including in Macau, dropped 6.1% in New York. Bigger rival Las Vegas Sands shed 5.4%, while stock in the company’s Hong Kong-listed division also suffered declines. Casino operator MGM China Holdings dropped 6.2% in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, some Chinese drugmakers and face mask manufacturers benefited from investors’ expectations that there may be an increased need for medication and containment in response to the outbreak, Mr. Lawler said.

SEC charges investment app Robinhood with misleading","      Boeing Co. stock trading was temporarily halted Tuesday after shares fell by almost 6 percent on reports that regulators plan to keep the company's fleet of troubled 737 Max airplanes grounded until July, far longer than originally planned. The Federal Aviation Administration released a statement shortly afterward confirming the news, and trading reopened. The planes have been grounded since March after two crashes killed a total of 346 people. ""The agency is following a thorough, deliberate process to verify that all proposed modifications to the Boeing 737 Max meet the highest certification standards,"" the FAA said. ""We have set no time frame for when the work will be completed."" Boeing issued its own statement, saying: ""We are informing our customers and suppliers that we are currently estimating that the ungrounding of the 737 Max will begin during mid-2020. Returning the Max safely to service is our number one priority, and we are confident that will happen. We acknowledge and regret the continued difficulties that the grounding of the 737 Max has presented to our customers, our regulators, our suppliers, and the flying public."" Airline stocks were under additional pressure Tuesday following news that a mysterious new coronavirus had killed six people and spread to Washington state. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled by almost 200 points as travel companies, luxury goods retailers and airlines all took hits as concerns rose that travel would be affected by passengers' fears that they would contract the virus. Federal health officials confirmed Tuesday that a case of coronavirus had been diagnosed north of Seattle.

10,Will American Airlines Continue to Struggle Over the Next 5 Years? | The Motley Fool,Will American Airlines Continue to Struggle Over the Next 5 Years?. MAX delays and slowing growth could mean more turbulence,"   American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) beat the S&P 500 last decade, rising 271% ahead of 188% for the index. Recently, however, investors have little to smile about, as American was the worst-performing major U.S. airline in the second half of the 2010s. Is there any hope for American Airlines, or should investors look for another opportunity?  AAL DATA BY YCHARTS Airlines are cyclical, capital-intensive businesses that used to be seen as poor investments given their exposure to fuel prices, safety risks, and geopolitics. That negative sentiment has changed in the United States, and for good reason; oil has been cheap for years.  AAL DATA BY YCHARTS With greater oil production comes more stability with jet fuel prices. Jet fuel can make or break an airline's bottom line, and in fact, it was a spike in prices that led to the downfall and eventual bankruptcy of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in 2005 and American Airlines Group in 2011. According to Forbes, the airline industry lost over $52 billion between 1977 and 2009. An economic slowdown, high jet fuel prices, and wavering demand pushed airlines to consolidate, a strategy that proved effective as airlines improved their capital structure and ability to pay obligations. Management evolved, analytics became more powerful, and an intense focus on measuring and improving the total revenue per available seat mile, known as TRASM, held management accountable and gave investors a more concrete way to evaluate the newly restructured airline industry.  With lower fuel prices, rising air travel demand, and P/E ratios that are less than half the S&P 500 average, U.S. major airlines are now seen as value stocks, garnering particular interest in 2016 when Warren Buffett,  a longtime opponent of investing in airlines, added millions of shares of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Like Southwest and United Airlines, American is negatively impacted by the ongoing groundings of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes. In its third-quarter 2019 press release, the company states: ""we know that our results should have been better. Our third quarter was impacted by the continued grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and the operational challenges resulting from ongoing labor contract negotiations.""

This is how far and fast,"Fears of a potential coronavirus pandemic has weighed heavily on shares of companies in a wide variety of sectors this week, particularly those with revenue exposure to travel into and out of China. With the death toll reaching 6, and with more than 300 having been infected by the virus, the Chinese government confirmed over the long weekend that the virus can be spread by humans. That sparked fears of a pandemic similar to that of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), another coronavirus that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2003 and killed about 800 people. As airports in several countries increased biosecurity screenings of passengers from China, travel-related stocks were hit hard, especially considering how travel could be curtailed during the upcoming Lunar New Year travel season. Don’t miss: Anxiety spreads around the globe as China’s coronavirus death toll reaches six. “Market participants fear possible contagion, as hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to travel this Lunar New Year, which begins Friday, and as the virus has been detected in three countries outside of China,” wrote Charles Campbell, trading desk specialist at MKM Partners, in a note to clients.

""We also can't sit here and tell you that we know exactly how long the MAX will be grounded or what the economic impact of the Asian coronavirus would be,"" Kirby said, according to a FactSet transcript. ""At this point, we're assessing the impact of the schedule, but we do not anticipate flying the MAX this summer."" Boeing had said Tuesday that it didn't expect the MAX to return until mid-2020.

15,Boeing Pushes Back 737 Max Return Again - The New York Times,Boeing Pushes Back 737 Max Return Again. Latest Updates. Site Index. Site Information Navigation,"ADVERTISEMENT  The company told airlines it did not expect regulators to approve the plane to fly until June or July, the latest in a string of setbacks. By Natalie Kitroeff The return of Boeing’s 737 Max has been delayed again. On Tuesday, the company said it did not expect regulators to approve the jet to fly again until the middle of the year. American Airlines, United and Southwest had already taken Max flights off their schedules until June, and if this new timeline holds, it would further push back when the plane will be available for commercial flights. The announcement reflects Boeing’s new appreciation for the challenges facing the company in its effort to persuade regulators that the Max is ready to fly. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration have continued to find new flaws with the Max that go beyond an automated software system known as MCAS. The software contributed to two accidents, in late 2018 and early 2019, that killed 346 people and led to the worldwide grounding of the Max in March. But the new estimate is conservative and intended in part to give Boeing some leeway with airline customers, who became frustrated over the past 10 months after the company repeatedly missed its own optimistic deadlines for the plane’s return to service, according to three people familiar with the matter. If regulators find no new problems with the plane, they could lift the grounding by the spring, the people said. Once the plane is cleared to fly, it will take airlines weeks to reintegrate them into their commercial schedules. The three United States carriers that fly the Max — American, United and Southwest — had already pushed back Max flights until June. They did not immediately change those schedules in response to Tuesday’s announcement. “Returning the Max safely to service is our No. 1 priority, and we are confident that will happen,” the company said in a statement. “We acknowledge and regret the continued difficulties that the grounding of the 737 Max has presented to our customers, our regulators, our suppliers and the flying public.” Late last year, Boeing discovered a potential problem with wire bundles on the plane, which were placed so close together that an electrical short could cause a catastrophic accident. In assessing the issue, the company recently identified about a dozen places in the Max where wire bundles may need to","Jan 22, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/business/boeing-737-max.html
