Southwest Airlines (LUV).," Source: Shutterstock Airline stocks historically have not had the best of reputations on Wall Street. For decades, they could not sustain their winning streaks for long. The perception was that they always found new ways of messing up, even while winning. But those days are over, because now when we fly, we get very few freebies. Passengers sometimes even have to pay extra to reserve a seat that they’ve already paid for. Checking luggage is also no longer always free. The bottom line is that airline stocks have cultivated taxing habits to enhance their bottom lines on a sustainable basis. Yet, the write-up today is to caution against going long these three airline stocks right now. This is not a knock against the companies themselves. In fact, about a month ago, I wrote about going long these very same stocks — and the trades paid well quickly. But now the stocks of United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) will likely offer up better entry opportunities than current levels. 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021  United Airlines stock is cheap. It trades at an under 9x price-to-earnings ratio and 0.5 times sales. There is little fat to trim off this bone. However, this doesn’t mean that the stock cannot fall. Since the bulls have fresh profits in hand, now is the best time to sit back and wait for another entry point before a new rally begins. Again, this is nothing against the company’s fundamentals. As with all three opinions today, these are trading opportunities around the actual price action, not the value of the company. UAL stock chart looks vulnerable at these levels. A better entry point would be closer to $89 per share. So I would either buy the dip if and when it happens, or I would wait for a technical breakout to chase. If the United Airlines bulls can rise above $95 per share then they would invite momentum buyers. The ensuing rally would then target triple digits. But it is best to wait for a confirmation of the breakout. 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021  DAL stock rallied 15% off its earnings report. But the bad news is that it has set another lower high since its 52-week top of around $63 per share. Since it also has been setting higher lows, the range of","Nov 14, 2019",https://investorplace.com/2019/11/3-airline-stocks-to-trade-into-2020/

2,United Airlines Stock: Why UBS Says to ‘Buy’ It?,United Airlines Stock: Why UBS Says to ‘Buy’ It?. Why “buy” United Airlines stock?. Fact check for United Airlines’ financials.,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO On Wednesday, a prominent analyst said to “buy” United Airlines (UAL) stock for double-digit returns over the next year. UBS analyst Myles Walton initiated coverage on the stock with bullish recommendations. His target price of $110 on the stock reflects an upside of 19% from the closing price of $92.42 on Wednesday. According to Barron’s report, Walton is impressed with United Airlines’ cost structure, which could help it expand its margins despite challenges ahead. During his sector initiation report, the analyst warned investors about tough times for airlines next year. Walton thinks that the industry could see a sudden spike in seating capacity after Boeing’s (BA) 737 MAX returns. Notably, the Boeing 737 MAX has faced a global flying ban since mid-March following two fatal accidents within five months. Approximately 390 MAX planes were in service before the grounding. More than 300 MAX planes are ready for delivery once global regulators lift the ban. Including grounded planes and new jets will result in a massive increase in overall seating capacity. According to Barron’s report, Walton thinks that the seating capacity could grow 5% YoY in 2020 compared with an expected decline of 4% this year. Therefore, Walton suggests that investors go for airline stocks that have high earnings and cash flow growth potential, according to Barron’s. The analyst thinks that United Airlines has a perfect combination of earnings and cash flow growth. He expects the company’s margins to keep improving through 2021. Walton’s view on United Airlines stock coincides with Bank of America (BAC) analyst Andrew Didora. In his sector initiation report on September 23, Didora cautioned about the overcapacity situation next year due to the MAX return. He told investors to go for airline stocks that have a better cost structure like United Airlines and Southwest Airlines (LUV). United Airlines has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company beat analysts’ estimates in the trailing seven quarters. Notably, the company registered strong double-digit bottom-line growth in all seven quarters. United Airlines’ operating cash flow has more than doubled in the last four years from $2.6 billion in 2014 to $6.2 billion in 2018. The free cash flow tripled to $2 billion in 2018 from $629 million in 2014. The company reported over 200 basis points of pre-tax margin improvement in the last four quarters. United Airlines’ consistent and strong quarterly performances and its ability to expand","Nov 14, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/11/united-airlines-stock-why-ubs-says-buy/

Last Updated at November 14, 2019 12:33 IST STOCK PRICE - CLICK HERE FOR MORE BSE 101.600.05 (0.05%) NSE 101.650.05 (0.05%) SpiceJet tumbled up to 7 per cent at Rs 105.8, also its 7-month low, on the BSE on Thursday after the budget carrier's loss widened in the September quarter at Rs 462 crore on the back of higher costs during a seasonally weak quarter. ""The net loss of Rs 462.58 crore in the latest September quarter was mainly on account of inflated costs with respect to MAX grounding and a seasonally weak quarter,"" the airline said in a statement. The figure includes a loss of Rs 180.3 crore on account of accounting standard Ind AS 116, it added. All Boeing Max aircraft have been grounded worldwide since mid-March of this year, following two fatal crashes that killed over 300 people. SpiceJet, which has 13 B737 Max aircraft in its fleet, has claimed compensation from Boeing for the grounding. However, the process hasn’t been started by Boeing yet. The airline had claimed compensation of Rs 114 crore in the previous quarter, and is yet to receive the amount. READ REPORT HERE The loss came as a surprise to most analysts as D-Street had factored-in a narrowed loss for the recently concluded quarter. Edelweiss Securities, for instance, had pegged the loss at Rs 322.4 crore, compared to loss of Rs 389.4 crore incurred in Q2FY19. The low cost carrier (LCC), in the previous quarter of the current fiscal (Q1FY20), reported a standalone profit of Rs 261.7 crore. Meanwhile, the airline's total income jumped to Rs 3,073.50 crore in the quarter under review from Rs 1,902.08 crore in the same period a year ago. Operating revenue rose to Rs 2,845.3 crore from Rs 1,874.8 crore YoY. The airline's maintenance cost grew 45 per cent YoY in the September quarter, with total expenses coming higher at 54.7 per cent to Rs 3,537.49 crore, even though fuel costs fell 77per cent to Rs 63.25 crore.

6,Copa Holdings Gains as Passenger Revenue Outpaces Higher Unit Costs | The Motley Fool,Copa Holdings Gains as Passenger Revenue Outpaces Higher Unit Costs. Solid demand trends absorbed the negative effects of the 737,"   Having appreciated 38% year to date, shares of airline Copa Holdings (NYSE:CPA) have outperformed those of most of its legacy and low-cost carrier peers so far in 2019. A localized focus on the Latin American market and manageable exposure to the grounded Boeing 737 MAX are two factors that have made Copa a popular choice among airline investors this year. Let's review below the company's third-quarter report, which was released after the close of trading on Wednesday. Note that all comparative numbers refer to those of the prior-year quarter. DATA SOURCE: COPA HOLDINGS. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In Copa's earnings press release, the company relayed to shareholders that it's removed its six Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft from its schedule until mid-February 2020 as part of the worldwide grounding of the MAX fleet. The company hasn't taken any deliveries of the MAX since the plane's initial grounding in March of 2019, though it was on schedule to receive seven more MAX planes by the end of 2019. The carrier also disclosed that subsequent to quarter-end, management made the decision to speed up the exit of its Embraer 190 fleet, which was originally planned to occur over a three-year period. Copa now intends to sell its remaining 14 E-190s over an 18-month period. Management anticipates a possible $90 million charge against earnings related to the sale of the aircraft and spare parts inventory. During Copa's earnings conference call, CEO Pedro Heilbron provided some context for the decision: With regards to other fleet matters, we have made the decision to exit our remaining Embraer-190s, as we see significant cost and revenue benefits from operating a single Boeing fleet. So, while we will most likely end up taking a significant number of MAX aircraft next year, most of them will be used to replace the outgoing 100-seat Embraer aircraft. As such, we now expect our capacity to grow only by approximately 5% year-over-year, with the bulk of the growth coming in during the second half of the year. Given the continued limbo of the 737 MAX, Copa Holdings on Wednesday reduced its full-year 2019 capacity guidance to a year-over-year decrease of 3%, against the previous projected capacity decline of 2%. In addition, the company tightened its anticipated operating margin percentage for 2019 to 16%, against an earlier range of 15% to 17%.

7,Why SpiceJet’s stock nosedived after the September quarter results,Why SpiceJet’s stock nosedived after the September quarter results. . ,"  SpiceJet Ltd’s shares faced turbulence on Thursday, falling 6% on BSE. In a seasonally weak quarter, the airline reported a loss of almost ₹463 crore, higher than the ₹328 crore loss that a Bloomberg poll of analysts was expecting. However, year-on-year revenue growth at 51%, led by solid capacity expansion, was impressive. What explains SpiceJet’s disappointing performance then? To begin with, cost pressures were back-breaking. Unabsorbed costs from the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft continue to haunt SpiceJet. Additionally, older aircraft that it had received from Jet Airways (India) Ltd, which shut operations earlier this year, added to cost pressures.

8,RH Shares Soar On Berkshire Hathaway Stake News | PYMNTS.com,RH Shares Soar After Berkshire Hathaway Stake Revealed. RECOMMENDED FOR YOU. TRENDING RIGHT NOW. UK FinTech GoCardless Raises $95 Million,"A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that Berkshire Hathaway now owns 1.2 million shares of furniture retailer RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware. As a result, shares of RH soared 7.5 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday (Nove. 14), rising 41 percent so far this year, according to CNBC. The filing includes investments by Warren Buffett and his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. In addition to its stake in RH, BH also obtained a new stake in Occidental Petroleum, but decreased its stake in Wells Fargo by 7.7 percent. Berkshire also cut its Phillips 66 stake by 6.7 percent, while maintaining its positions in Bank of America, Delta Air Lines, Bank of New York Mellon and Coca-Cola. Back in May, it was reported that BH owned $860.6 million of Amazon shares at the end of March. While Buffet has shied away from tech companies in the past, saying he didn't know enough about the industry, Berkshire Hathaway bought shares in Apple in 2016 and built the stake it holds to upward of $50 billion. Buffet has credited both Combs and Weschler for purchases of both airline stocks and Apple, saying they give the firm “younger eyes.” Berkshire will often purchase stocks when buying the entire company is too costly. The company also owns more than 90 businesses, including the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer. The interest in Amazon came after Berkshire teamed up with Amazon and JPMorgan on Haven, an independent healthcare company that is aiming to fix the nation’s healthcare system, with a focus on reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction. “We want to change the way people experience healthcare so that it is simpler, better and lower cost,” Dr. Atul Gawande, Haven’s CEO, said in a statement in March. “We’ll start small, learn from the experience of patients, and continue to expand to meet their needs.” —————————— NEW PYMNTS STUDY: HOW LOCATION DATA CAN HELP BANKS PREVENT ONLINE FRAUD   The November 2020 study How Location Data Can Help Banks Prevent Online Fraud, PYMNTS surveyed a balanced panel of 2,141 U.S. consumers who own mobile devices and use credit or debit cards at least monthly.

Why","Stocks: Understanding the Risk-Return...  Trading Stocks: What You Need to Know...  Stocks can be a valuable part of your investment portfolio. Owning stocks in different companies can help you build your savings, protect your money from inflation and taxes, and maximize income from your investments. It's important to know that there are risks when investing in the stock market. Like any investment, it helps to understand the risk/return relationship and your own tolerance for risk. Let's look at three benefits of investing in stocks. Build. Historically, long-term equity returns have been better than returns from cash or fixed-income investments such as bonds. However, stock prices tend to rise and fall over time. Investors may want to consider a long-term perspective for their equity portfolio because these stock-market fluctuations do tend to smooth out over longer periods of time.  Protect. Taxes and inflation can impact your wealth. Equity investments can give investors better tax treatment over the long term, which can help slow or prevent the negative effects of both taxes and inflation. Maximize. Some companies pay shareholders dividends1 or special distributions. These payments can provide you with regular investment income and enhance your return, while the favourable tax treatment for Canadian equities can leave more money in your pocket. (Note that dividend payments from companies outside of Canada are taxed differently.) The two main types of equity investments below can each offer investors different benefits. 1. Common shares Common shares are the most (you guessed it!) common type of equity investment for Canadian investors. They can offer: Capital growth. The price of a stock will go up or down over time. When it goes up, shareholders can choose to sell their shares at a profit. Dividend income. Many companies pay dividends to their shareholders, which can be a source of tax-efficient income for investors. Voting privileges. The ability to vote means shareholders have some measure of control over who runs the company and how. Liquidity. Typically, common shares can be bought and sold more quickly and easily than other investments, such as real estate, art or jewellery. This means investors can buy or sell their investment for cash with relative ease. Advantageous tax treatment. Dividend income and capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than employment income and interest income from bonds or GICs. 2.

Despite YoY robust growth in its income from Rs 1,882 crore in Q2FY19 to Rs 2,759 crore in Q2FY20 — an increase of nearly 46.5 per cent — the company has reported rise in its YoY loss of some 19 per cent. This led to a correction in the SpiceJet share price from around Rs 115 per stock levels to Rs 107 today. This has attracted the eyeballs of the stock market experts because they believe that the weak results have had its full impact on the SpiceJet stock and now the aviation counter may show some upside movement - it may well have created a how to become rich on stock markets moment.

We believe that the sector dynamics will remain favorable due to the recent consolidation in the industry. This will ensure pricing discipline in the medium term. After aggressive fleet addition in Q1FY20, the airline added 4 NGs this quarter, taking the fleet strength to 113 planes. SpiceJet is banking on an early return of the MAX planes to service, which will drive operational efficiencies. In the interim, they are inducting aircraft on short term leases in the ongoing winter schedule.""  Makharia went on to add that SpiceJet is expanding its international operations post the grounding of Jet Airways.
