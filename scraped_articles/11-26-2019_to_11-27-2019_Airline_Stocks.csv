0,7 Airline Stocks Investors Should Put on Their Christmas Lists | InvestorPlace,7 Airline Stocks Investors Should Put on Their Christmas Lists. These stocks will soar on low valuations and high profit," Source: Shutterstock The beginning of the holiday season brings attention back to an airline industry heading into its busy season. From a stock market perspective, this rightly draws attention to retailers. However, investors should also pay attention to another class of equities that sees increased activity during the holiday season: airline stocks. An estimated 55.3 million Americans will travel 50 miles away from home or more during Thanksgiving week. Of those, analysts expect about 4.45 million of those will take to the skies. They expect almost 46 million passengers to fly between Dec. 20 and Jan. 6. That comes in about 5.2% higher than 2017 levels. High travel volumes during Christmas come as no surprise to investors. Still, this holiday travel provides much-needed revenue that will bolster some airline stocks in the weeks and months to come. Hence, investors should keep the following tickers on their watch lists: 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021 Still, both the airline and ALK stock took a hit in 2018, seeing its earnings per share fall by more than half. At the time, rising oil prices, as well as competition and the costs of absorbing Virgin America, weighed on ALK. Alaska stock peaked at just over $100 per share in March 2017. From there, it steadily declined, reaching a low point of $53.39 in early 2019. However, since that time, it has trended upward. It sells for around $69 per share as of the time of this writing. Currently, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of around 10. Moreover, with profits set to grow by an average of 20.15% per year over the next five years, it is recovering from the massive decline brought about in its purchase of Virgin. With robust earnings growth and the former Virgin America giving it an authentic, nationwide footprint, ALK is one of the airline stocks set to resume its recovery and growth. 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021    Allegiant (NASDAQ:ALGT) is one of the airline stocks filling a unique niche in the airline industry. The carrier charters flights from cold-weather destinations to smaller airports in warmer areas. This so-called “ultra-low-cost” airline can also charter flights to destinations in Canada and Mexico. With millions of consumers willing to sacrifice luxuries on flights to save money, this model has proven profitable.

Per A4A, 3.7% more passengers will be flying to various destinations in the 12-day travel period (Nov 22-Dec 3) this year compared to 2018. Meanwhile, American Airlines AAL grabbed headlines by virtue of its decision to launch 20 seasonal routes for next year’s summer. As the summer season is historically a busy one for airlines, the addition of new routes is expected to attract substantial traffic, and in turn, bolster American Airlines’ top line. The past week also saw European low-cost carrier Ryanair RYAAY ink a seven-year technology partnership with Vodafone Business, which is part of the Vodafone Group. Additionally, JetBlue Airways JBLU entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) deal with Morgan Stanley to buy back $160 million worth of its stock.

2,Here's How Much Warren Buffett Has Lost on American Airlines | The Motley Fool,Here's How Much Warren Buffett Has Lost on American Airlines. The investor's flight has been a turbulent one so far..,"   Warren Buffett for years advised against buying airline stocks, warning the industry had an ""insatiable"" demand for capital that required investors to pour money ""into a bottomless pit."" But all of that changed in the second half of 2016, when Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) began buying a basket of U.S. airline stocks including shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Buffett explained his change of heart to CNBC in February 2017. Airlines indeed had had ""a bad first century,"" he said, comparing the industry to the until-recently feckless Chicago Cubs baseball team. But he said that while it remains ""a very tough business"" due to the high fixed cost of buying airplanes, he believes a round of bankruptcies and consolidation has created an industry that can better match up supply with demand and generate sustained profitability. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. So how has the investment in American Airlines paid off for the Oracle of Omaha? Here's a look at Berkshire Hathaway's returns so far. First, some caveats. Berkshire Hathaway doesn't tell us the exact day and price it bought its shares, but the company does file quarterly statements with regulators disclosing its holdings, giving us a rough idea of when shares were bought and sold. The price paid is far less clear, but we can get a general idea by using American's average share price during the quarter. These are back-of-the-envelope calculations that should be in range but are not meant to be precise. Berkshire Hathaway first bought into American in the third quarter of 2016 and continued to build its position in the two quarters that followed. The company trimmed its position slightly in late 2017 and then again in 2018. As of Sept. 30 of this year, Berkshire Hathaway owns 43.7 million shares of American worth about $1.22 billion as of the company's Nov. 21 closing share price.

4,Hochschulschriften / The Effect of Oil Price Shocks on Airline Stock Returns,Schrift:. Content. Lists. Clouds. Information. Bibliographic Metadata,"Counteracting declining oil reserves, Middle Eastern oil exporting economies undertake substantial investments in the aviation industry. Serving as a hub between Europe, Africa and Asia, their geographic location certainly gives them a comparative advantage over other major airline hubs in developed countries. However, these investments can also be justified by hedging considerations. Due to the high historical volatility of oil prices, oil exporters are exposed to significant financial risks. Investing in oil-intensive industries, the returns of which are negatively correlated with the oil price, can compensate for losses realized through a decrease in the market price of crude oil. Using monthly data from 1973 to 2018 of ndividual airline stocks and representative indices I investigate whether these assets can qualify as hedging instruments for oil-exporting countries. Distinguishing between structural oil supply and demand shocks reveals heterogeneous but highly significant results. The responses of excess stock returns to an oil price decrease vary between airlines and sectors as well as with the kind of oil price shock considered. The results suggest that investing in oil-intensive industries provides a potential hedge against oil price fluctuations that stabilizes revenues. The performance crucially depends on the chosen asset and the type of oil price shock.","Nov 27, 2019",https://epub.jku.at/obvulihs/content/titleinfo/4563833

Iberia Flights.","Sometimes, it is better to splurge a little bit if it means comfort and safety. When it comes to travelling, flying is usually the fastest option. Since flying can be kind of expensive, people are always looking for the cheapest route to their destination. They will search and search for the cheapest airline and try and book with them. This is not always the best idea. Sometimes, it is better to splurge a little bit if it means comfort and safety. There are airlines out there that will guarantee you a good flight, but it comes with a hefty price tag. Then there are airlines that are cheap, but even though you are saving money, your comfort (and safety) may be at risk. We are going to go through the 10 airlines that we should all avoid with every ounce of our being, and 10 that may be worth the splurge to make our vacations great. Let's start with the 10 we should all avoid... RyanAir is an airline that is based in Dublin and it is considered a low-cost carrier. This airline follows the principle of ‘you get what you pay for.’ Their seats do not recline, which means you are forced to be upright and cramped the entire flight. There are also no reserving seats on this airline. The main thing that customers complain about when it comes to Iberia flights is customer service. Passengers state that seat comfort, food quality, and staff disposition are all things that are put on the back burner when it comes to their flights. They also say that meal service is often rushed. China Airlines is known for not being the safest airline, and there is not one airline that is cheap enough to make anyone risk their life. Since the launch of the airline in 1959, there have been 760 fatalities. The majority of them happened from the late '90s until now. United Airlines has had its time on the news, and it is not for a good reason. They have a horrible track record of leaving passengers stranded due to delays. The US Department of Transportation actually fined them over a million dollars in 2013 due to the never-ending delays. There is almost too much wrong with American Airlines to list. In the year 2013, only 78% of flights managed to land on time.

El Al's third quarter net profit was $27 million, 36% lower than in the","  The rise in passenger numbers at Ben Gurion Airport in the third quarter, alongside a fall in the price of jet fuel, did not translate into an improvement in the bottom line of El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. (TASE: ELAL), which saw its profit dip, among other things because of a rise in salary costs. El Al's share price is currently down by more than 17% on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. El Al's third quarter net profit was down 36% in comparison with the third quarter of 2018, at $27 million, despite an 18% rise in the number of passengers passing through Ben Gurion Airport in the quarter. For the first nine months of 2019, El Al posted a loss of $28 million, which compares with a loss of $21 million in the corresponding period of 2018. Operating revenue rose 1% to $647 million in the third quarter. Revenue from carrying passengers rose by $8 million (1.3%). The rise is attributed to a rise in the number of passengers per kilometer flown, partly offset by a fall in return per passenger kilometer. El Al also cites negative impact from changes in the shekel exchange rate against the US dollar. Cargo revenue fell by $2 million, because of a decline in the quantity of cargo carried and a decline in return per kilometer/tonne, against a background of global weakness in the cargo market and tough competition. Operating expenses grew by $1.2 million in the third quarter to $505 million. Salary costs rose by $11 million, arising from expansion of activity, with an 8% in supply of passenger seats per kilometer.

14,'New Flight Charters' Announces Largest Public Listing of Private Jet Charter Empty Legs | Markets Insider,. 'New Flight Charters' Announces Largest Public Listing of Private Jet Charter Empty Legs. SHARE THIS POST. Your Market View.,"   DENVER, Nov. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- New Flight Charters, the leading On-Demand private jet charter brokerage, now publishes the largest public listing of empty legs in the jet charter industry comprised of over 200 upcoming and available empty legs from U.S. private charter aircraft.  The updated listing is public and easily referenced on any device or computer by bookmarking the online Empty Legs List.  The company's Best Price Guarantee applies, also to private charter flights of any kind.  Empty Legs
Known sometimes as ""dead-heads"" or ""ferry flights"", empty legs are flights without passengers on board when an aircraft needs to be moved.  Often a private charter jet will have empty leg flights associated with an existing flight schedule- when it needs to move to another location to start a charter, or return back to base after completing a charter, or similar situations for its owner's flights.  These empty legs, when an aircraft needs to fly a certain direction, can be a good opportunity for a discounted jet charter.  Aircraft can be re-routed to accommodate a similar charter flight need.  For example, an empty leg from Houston to Denver can be rerouted for a Dallas to Aspen charter at a lower than normal cost.  Empty Leg Pricing
Quotes will vary since each empty leg charter is unique, but pricing is typically 30-50% lower than standard charter quotes.  Ten examples from the current Empty Legs Listing of over 200 flights: ""When an empty leg matches up with a flight need, there is no better value in private flying,"" commented Rick Colson, New Fight Charters' president.  ""With with the largest aircraft resource of 7,598 in the U.S., New Flight Charters sources ideal options for any requested charter including empty legs, based and floating fleet aircraft, and with the industry's only Best Price Guarantee."" Floating Fleets
A second attractive and cost savings solution are floating fleets.  The fastest-growing segment in private jet charter are non-based ""floating fleet"" aircraft with better point-to-point, one-way pricing.  These can be available for all types of flying, from shorter one-hour flights to coast-to-coast and international flights.  Floating Fleet aircraft do not have to return to a base, and thus can be more cost-effective charter options. 453 floating fleet jets from 40 operators are available nationwide through New Flight Charters; all sizes from light jets to ultra","Nov 26, 2019",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/new-flight-charters-announces-largest-public-listing-of-private-jet-charter-empty-legs-1028719353

16,Why the Qantas share price just hit a new record high,. . . . . . . . . Why the Qantas share price just hit a new record high.,"      Ken Hall | November 26, 2019 9:39am | More on: AIZ QAN VAH ASX 200 The Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX: QAN) share price climbed 1.96% higher to $7.28 per share yesterday – a new record high for Qantas on the ASX. The company’s shares have surged 26.39% higher in 2019. But what’s driving the Aussie airline’s shares higher, and is November the best time to buy?  The Qantas share price climbed higher on Monday as Aussie equities generally performed well. The S&P/ASX 200 Index (INDEXASX: XJO) added 21.60 points (0.32%) to close at 6,731.40 points yesterday. There were no announcements or news from Qantas in yesterday’s trade but there could be some momentum behind the stock. The Qantas share price pushed higher on Friday after gaining ACCC approval for its deal with BP. The regulator will grant a 5-year authorisation, which will allow BP to require BP-branded petrol stations to be a part of the Qantas rewards programs. Cost savings and public benefits were cited as key factors behind the decision. The ACCC doesn’t believe it will result in materially lower competition in the market. Qantas has gone from strength to strength in recent weeks and hit another record high last Wednesday. The company’s shares have surged higher in November after unveiling its plans to be net carbon neutral by 2050. Qantas will double the number of flights being carbon offset with a cap on net emissions starting next year. Qantas shares clearly have momentum behind them at the moment following the stock’s recent record highs. However, that may be a double-edged sword, as shares could be overvalued at $7.28 per share. That being said, if you’re looking for an airline to add to your portfolio in 2019, I think Qantas looks like better value than Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd (ASX: VAH) or Air New Zealand Ltd (ASX: AIZ). Both airline rivals have seen their share prices fall lower in 2019 as higher fuel prices and weaker earnings have had a significant impact.

17,Barry Michaels’s first attempt to launch an airline landed him in prison. Now he’s trying again. - The Washington Post,"A previous attempt to start an airline landed this guy in federal prison. Now he’s trying again, pitching $19 fares","Barry Michaels’s first attempt to start a bargain airline ended with him being sued by investors, sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission and ultimately receiving 21 months in federal prison on securities fraud and tax charges. That was in the 1990s. Last week, Michaels once again brought his idea to the Department of Transportation, seeking approval to fly giant 747s on domestic routes and offering bottom-dollar fares propped up by onboard advertising. He calls the company Avatar Airlines and is hoping to raise $300 million from investors to get it off the ground. Michaels, a Las Vegas business executive, referred questions about the venture to Avatar’s chief legal officer, Michael E. Zapin. Zapin said he understands people might have concerns about Michaels’s background but said the idea for the airline is sound and that Michaels should be given a chance. “At what point is someone given a chance to make right? I don’t know? Is it a lifelong sentence?” Zapin said. “Should he be just shut down for the rest of his life?” Avatar submitted a 450-page application to the Department of Transportation, outlining a business plan and the names of key executives who would run the company. Avatar pitches itself as an antidote to the downsizing and upcharging that has become common across the industry, proposing to fly 747s with space to carry almost 600 passengers in comfort and making almost every single surface inside and outside the planes available to advertisers. Fares would be as low as $19. “Nothing will be sacred,” Avatar’s application reads. “Management even envisions patrons using the restroom and being ‘greeted’ by a named brand bathroom tissue company when they look inside the lid of the lavatory bowl.” The Transportation Department has yet to respond to the application, but it turned Avatar down in 2017, after almost a decade of trying to get information from the company about its proposed operations, questioning its financial fitness and the experience of its proposed management team. Throughout the process, which began in 2008, officials expressed concern about Michaels’s past legal problems. “The fact that you were convicted of securities fraud in connection with that prior application is especially troubling to us,” a Transportation Department official wrote to Michaels in 2009. Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst who has tracked Michaels’s efforts, said there is industry interest in starting new airlines — founders of JetBlue and Allegiant","Nov 27, 2019",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/11/27/previous-attempt-start-an-airline-landed-this-guy-federal-prison-now-hes-trying-again-pitching-fares-s/

The Dow Jones was paralyzed on Tuesday because investors appeared to reject more vacuous US-China trade deal hype. By: Josiah Wilmoth | Email | Leave a comment The Dow traded flat on Tuesday, struggling to grind higher after joining the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in record territory one day earlier. Investors digested more positive news on the trade war front, but today’s market paralysis suggests that investors believe the hype is fundamentally vacuous. The US stock market’s three major indices ranged near record levels this morning. After closing at a fresh high on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sought to extend its rally. But shortly after the open, the Dow had lost 13.27 points or 0.05% to nudge down to 28,053.2. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also secured new all-time highs on Nov. 25, and they clung to those levels on Tuesday. The S&P 500 dipped 2.05 points or 0.07% to 3,131.59. The Nasdaq declined 2.77 points or 0.03% to 8,629.72. The sustained equities rally has battered the gold price, which now languishes near a three-month low. Gold lost another 0.2% on Tuesday, settling at $1,454. Though awash in China-dependant stocks, the Dow Jones ignored the latest indication that the US and China remain committed to prioritizing a “phase one” trade agreement. Earlier this morning, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. According to China’s Ministry of Commerce, the phone call went well, and the two sides “reached consensus on how to","Nov 26, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/dow-jones-analysis-11-26-2019/

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Joseph Cotterill and David Pilling in Johannesburg South Africa’s state-owned flag carrier is on the brink of financial collapse after it paid only half of staff salaries this month and struggled to secure funds to survive. South African Airways suffered a “sudden deterioration” in its finances after a recent strike grounded flights, Pravin Gordhan, minister for state-owned companies, said on Wednesday. The government is working with the airline “to urgently formulate immediate actions that will be required to provide support to enable SAA to carry on its business”, he said. The airline, once Africa’s largest, may have to file for liquidation if it cannot secure R2bn ($135m) of working capital in the next few days, people familiar with the matter said. SAA needs a government guarantee to borrow the capital from banks but Tito Mboweni, the finance minister, has been reluctant to approve further bailouts. The airline’s fate poses a dilemma for President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has pledged to turn round state companies that were looted under his predecessor, Jacob Zuma. But he is also under pressure to shore up strained public finances. This month’s strike over planned job cuts grounded SAA domestic and international flights for days as Mr Ramaphosa’s government clashed with unions. SAA has needed billions of dollars in state aid to stay aloft in the past two decades but graft and waste have left it struggling to compete with resurgent African and Gulf airlines. “SAA competes in a cut-throat industry with razor-thin margins. There are 50 airlines serving South Africa,” said Martin Kingston, a member of SAA’s board. The airline has failed to produce accounts for the past two years because of doubts as to whether it remains a going concern. Mr Mboweni’s Treasury has already agreed to repay R9.2bn in debts that will come due for the airline in the next three years. However, last month Mr Mboweni drew a line over handing over more money for an airline that he regards as a middle-class subsidy in a deeply unequal society. Mr Mboweni is battling to find funds to bail out Eskom, the blackout-prone state power monopoly whose $30bn debts dwarf SAA. Eskom is deemed a higher priority as it generates nearly all of South Africa’s electricity. “The minister of finance is in an extremely difficult situation. He is highly fiscally constrained and one has to ask whether","Nov 27, 2019",https://www.ft.com/content/04f30ea8-1140-11ea-a225-db2f231cfeae
