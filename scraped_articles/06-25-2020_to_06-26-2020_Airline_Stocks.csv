0,Airline Stocks Are Falling as Covid-19 Cases Rise | Barron's,"Airline Stocks Are Falling as Covid-19 Cases Rise. . . 8 Hardware Stocks to Buy for 2021, According to Morgan","    The rally in airline stocks is stalling over concerns that a second wave of coronavirus cases will put the brakes on air travel. American Airlines Group (ticker: AAL), meanwhile, priced $2.5 billion in bonds with an 11.75% interest rate—adding more debt to its balance sheet and prompting UBS to trim its price target on the stock. Airline stocks were down about 1% Thursday, after falling an average 7.7% on Wednesday, according to the NYSE Arca Airline Index. American was off 2%, taking its stock down to around $12.75, well below its recent high of $20.31 on June 8. States such as Arizona, California, Georgia, Florida, and Texas are seeing cases rise again after reopening their economies. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is urging residents to stay home. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are now requiring travelers from states with high infection rates to quarantine for 14 days. California is seeing a surge in cases, as is Florida. Analysts worry that the new wave of cases could put the brakes on a recovery in air travel. “Demand has improved recently despite cases on the rise, but we are concerned this could be tenuous,” Cowen’s Helane Becker wrote in a note published Thursday. Air travel has been rising for weeks, reaching 607,000 passengers through security checkpoints on June 22, a big jump from around 90,000 a day in mid-April. But passenger traffic declined on June 23 and 24, going down to 471,000 and 494,00. Traffic would likely keep declining if cases continue to spike. The five major states that are reporting a big rise in cases represented 58% of total new cases in the U.S. on June 23, Becker notes. They accounted for 31% to 45% of average seat miles—a measure of demand—for U.S. airlines in 2019. Florida and California are also major vacation destinations. And delays in resort openings are almost certainly coming. Walt Disney (DIS) is now under pressure to delay opening its theme parks in Florida and California, originally set for mid-July. Becker notes that SeaWorld and Universal Orlando opened earlier this month. “If those attractions elect to close again or delay opening, it would start to choke off the nascent recovery we are seeing in the Orlando area,” she wrote. What airlines are most affected? Southwest Airlines (LUV) appears to be the most directly affected with 45% of its average seat miles originating in","Jun 25, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-stocks-are-falling-as-covid-19-cases-rise-51593098234
1,Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Today. The pandemic shows no signs of slowing, and that's bound to prolong the recovery..","   Airline shares are under pressure again on Friday as it continues to grow more apparent the United States is going to be dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic for a considerable amount of time. If so, the fragile beginnings of a travel recovery could be threatened, and the airlines are going to need to weather a prolonged downturn. Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) led the sector lower with a 7.3% decline as of 11:45am EDT Friday. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), which on Friday announced plans to lift capacity restrictions despite the growing number of cases, and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) each traded down more than 5%. The rest of the airlines were also under pressure, with Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) down 4% apiece and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), and Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) each down more than 3%. The airline industry has been decimated by the pandemic, with second-quarter revenue expected to be down 90% year over year as demand for travel dropped to near zero in March and April. The shares have bounced off of April lows in recent weeks on signs that there is pent-up demand for travel and slow growth in ticket sales, but increasing COVID-19 cases in a number of tourism-focused states is putting that rally in jeopardy. Texas is now rolling back some of its planned reopenings due to an increase in hospitalizations, with bars and taverns forced to suspend operations on Friday. Elsewhere, theme park plans to reopen are in jeopardy as case numbers jump in Florida, and throughout the Sunbelt states are grappling with new COVID-19 concerns. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Airlines have done a good job raising cash to try to ride out the crisis, by some estimates raising nearly $50 billion in debt and equity financing on top of a similar amount of government support. But with large airlines burning through $40 million or more per day, no amount of cash will sustain operations indefinitely. The increase in new cases suggests we are in for a long, slow recovery, putting pressure on airline stocks. On Friday, American announced a move that highlights the difficult position the airlines are in. American said it would lift capacity restrictions and offer all seats for sale beginning on July 1, even as the number of new cases continues to grow.

4,Stock market today: Delta could be litmus test for rest of travel stocks,This stock could be a litmus test for the rest of the travel industry: Miller Tabak. MORE IN TRADING NATION.,"The travel industry has been dealt another blow as the tri-state area imposes quarantine restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. Watch this one stock as an indicator for the rest of the group, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. “The one stock that I think people should look at very closely because it looks just like the charts of all the other airline stocks and basically most of the other travel and leisure names is Delta Air Lines,” Maley told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday. “The sell-off more recently hasn’t taken it to an oversold condition. In fact, it’s quite neutral. So it’s going to have to get a lot more oversold before we really want to back up the truck here.”  Delta’s relative strength index, or RSI, is 45. Any reading below 30 suggests oversold conditions. It last traded with an RSI below 30 in April. “It got back up above its April highs, that old resistance level became new support, it tested that the support level a couple of weeks ago. It’s now testing it again. It looks like it wants to break through. If it does, the momentum money that’s been hot in these names is going to bail on the stock,” Maley said. He is not the only market watcher wary of the travel stocks right now.  “We’re pretty much avoiding the space right now. Any time you go into the travel and leisure space … you know it’s high beta, highly volatile. So you really have to buckle up,” said John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, during the same segment. Delta, for example, is up 52% from a May low. However, it remains down 58% from last July’s high.  “The airlines could be of interest but we want to see the length and the depth of where Covid round two comes through and how far the government will step in to protect this industry if there is another leg down. So we think there’s way too many exogenous variables that are hard to quantify right now to really step into the trade,” said Petrides. Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip?

Contact. Subscribe to the latest update.," CLAUSIUS 25. JUNE 2020  Issued by Xuemin Jia, Msc, Seahawk Investments GmbH Executive summary: COVID-19 has thrown the global airline industry into the darkest period in history – due to the rapid, massive spread of the virus, almost all countries have imposed lockdown and travel restrictions starting from end of January in China, to mid-March in the U.S. and Europe, until mid-May. As a result, over 80% of global fleets have been grounded in March, airlines have been burning cash every day, airline stocks have been slashed to half of pre-crisis level since then. This pandemic brought a drastic short-term impact on air traffic demand. At present, flight bookings are slowly recovering as the virus spread is fairly under control by now, but it could alter people’s travel behaviour and public health policies – social distancing will become a new normal. Looking back, airlines have experienced some good years as a result of the fast globalization development, the rapidly growing Asian aviation market growth and increasing global GDP growth. Global commercial airline revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% after the global financial crisis. As compared to previous years, airlines in general had lower debt levels and stronger liquidity positions in 2019 which enabled a softer landing during the crisis. We expect low cost carriers (LCC) to get through this crisis in better shape. LCCs are able to operate more efficiently due to their competitive cost structure, smaller scale, lower exposure to international routes and stronger balance sheets. Once travel demand starts to pick up, we expect them to recover at a faster speed to the pre-crisis level. In contrast, many full-service carriers (FSC) had to rely on government aid to survive, which translates into elevated debt and equity dilution. Some flagship carriers have to experience a costly recapitalization before they start to generate profit again. Strings attached to government rescue packages are normally associated with suspended share buybacks, suspended dividends which make their stocks less lucrative. Empirically, airlines needed at least one year after material disruptions to reach operational profitability. Examples are the 2008 financial crisis or the 2003 SARS pandemic. When the lockdown has ended and economies have slowly reopened, domestic air traffic in the US has initially picked up quicker than expected. Market sentiment has suddenly turned very optimistic. However, evaluating the fundamentals of the airline equity market, we believe","Jun 25, 2020",https://www.seahawk-investments.com/2020/06/25/global-airline-outlook-are-airlines-investable-post-covid-19/?lang=en

SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER!.,"An airline sector-specific exchange traded fund is flying into some turbulence as ongoing coronavirus concerns weigh on the travel outlook. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEArca: JETS), the lone ETF dedicated to airline stocks, dipped 3.5% on Friday and was 8.1% lower over the past week. A number of states, including Arizona, Texas, South Carolina, and Florida, saw COVID-19 cases jump by more than 30% in the past week. The spike in infections has even caused Texas to halt reopening plans Thursday while some other governors enacted new measures to help contain another outbreak. “Demand has improved recently despite cases on the rise, but we are concerned this could be tenuous,” Cowen’s Helane Becker said in a note, according to Barron’s. Air travel has been increasing for weeks with higher passenger counts, but passenger traffic declined on June 23 and 24, going down to 471,000 and 494,00, respectively, compared to 607,000 on June 22. Traffic could keep declining if coronavirus cases continue to spike. Meanwhile, the European Union was moving closer to recommending that travels from the U.S. shouldn’t be allowed entry to the bloc after July 1, Bloomberg reports. On the other hand, 18 countries, including Canada and South Korea, may be allowed entry into the EU after their level of new Covid-19 cases fell to the bloc’s criteria. European countries are trying to balance the desire for reviving domestic economies against the backdrop of the summer tourist season as many fear a second wave of coronavirus infections. Meanwhile, the previously positive reactions to bailout deals for the airline industry, like the debt relief plans for Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Air France-KLM, are beginning to dissipate. “For the time being, the risk of insolvency is off the table and the funds can flow” at Lufthansa, Dirk Schlamp, a DZ Bank analyst who recommends selling the German company’s stock, wrote in a note, according to Bloomberg. Still, “major challenges await” as the carrier faces “extensive restructuring due to excessive costs,” with the airline industry unlikely to return to pre-crisis business until at least 2023.

15,A Flight Attendant's Dilemma: Take a Pay Cut or Retire Early? | ThinkAdvisor,A Flight Attendant's Dilemma: Take a Pay Cut or Retire Early?. . . . The Troubled Transit Manager. Trending Stories.,"  The U.S. airline industry has been among the sectors hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic as most Americans stopped flying for business and leisure as soon as it started, sending airline stocks tumbling in March. As a result, flight attendants, pilots and other employees throughout the industry — including a client of Alexandria, Virginia-based RIA firm Campbell Wealth Management who works as a flight attendant — were urged by the airlines to take voluntary buyouts or extended time-off or early retirement packages. Although U.S. airlines that accepted federal aid under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act agreed to not cut jobs or salaries of employees until Oct. 1, it is widely expected they will slash jobs and pay after that date. The situation has directly affected Campbell Wealth Management’s client, a single woman who has “worked for the airline industry for decades as a flight attendant” and wasn’t planning to retire for a few years, according to Kelly Campbell, CEO of the firm, whose clients have an average of $1.5 million to $2 million in wealth being managed, he said. The flight attended contacted a Campbell Wealth advisor in early April and said the airline she works for offered her the choice of a voluntary early retirement package or to continue working for lower pay, at least for the time being, and that created a dilemma for her, he told ThinkAdvisor, noting that, for one thing, “she’s not quite ready to retire.” But she had one major concern if she continued flying: She was worried about the “danger out there” from potentially contracting the coronavirus, he said, adding: “Several of her coworkers actually tested positive for COVID and two of them actually passed away.” The client was also in the at-risk demographic from a health standpoint due to her age, he pointed out, adding: “There’s a lot of competing issues” that she had to weigh. On top of all that, the airline didn’t give her much time to make a decision on what she wanted to do. As the firm’s advisors do with every client, the advisor who worked directly with the flight attendant went over a financial plan with her, Campbell noted. The main issue for every client planning retirement to consider is that if they retire early, they will have less money in their retirement accounts and would need more money to live","Jun 25, 2020",https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/06/25/a-flight-attendants-dilemma-take-a-pay-cut-or-retire-early/
