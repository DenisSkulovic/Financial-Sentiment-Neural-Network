0,3 Airline Stocks to Buy in August | The Motley Fool,3 Airline Stocks to Buy in August. COVID-19 has caused airline equity prices to plummet. Here's three names to consider,"   It's been a rough year for airline investors, as the coronavirus pandemic has caused global travel volumes to evaporate, sending the industry scrambling to avoid bankruptcies. Shares of U.S. airlines are down between 40% and 63% year to date. There are likely good bargains to be found if the industry can weather the crisis. But given the uncertainty about COVID-19, and about how the economy will look when the pandemic is over, there's no assurances the airlines can persevere. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. For those brave enough to dip their toes into the airline sector and hope for the best, here's why Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), and Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) are three airline stocks worth considering. John Rosevear (Southwest Airlines): Southwest has long been a favorite of investors, and there are some very good reasons to like it now. For starters, Southwest has the not-at-all-dubious distinction of being the only major airline that has never gone through bankruptcy -- and it's arguably the carrier with the best chance of gliding through the current crisis unscathed.  That's a credit to management, which has always kept the company's balance sheet in clear skies. At a moment when the industry's skies are anything but clear, it's still true: Having raised about $16 billion since the beginning of the year, the company said in June that it has enough cash to last two years at its current burn rate.  Better yet, it expects that burn rate to decline over time, even if industry conditions don't improve -- and if things get worse or last longer than we expect, it has about $12 billion in additional unencumbered assets to borrow against. SOUTHWEST WAS AN EARLY CUSTOMER FOR BOEING'S TROUBLED 737 MAX. IRONICALLY, THE AIRCRAFT'S TROUBLES ARE PROVIDING A CASH STREAM RIGHT WHEN SOUTHWEST NEEDS IT: BOEING HAS ALREADY PAID SOUTHWEST OVER $400 MILLION IN 737 MAX-RELATED DAMAGES THIS YEAR. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. Of course, things will get better for all of the airlines, eventually. But another reason to like Southwest is that its recovery might come early. Consider that the majority of its routes are domestic, which are likely to see demand return before international routes, and that in a typical recession, it's the leisure travelers (rather than business travelers) who return first -- because they're more likely to travel when tickets are discounted.

1,Forget Airline Stocks. These 3 Stocks Are Better Buys Right Now. | The Motley Fool,"Forget Airline Stocks. These 3 Stocks Are Better Buys Right Now.. With a recovery looking distant, passenger airlines aren't top","   The coronavirus pandemic has hit the airline industry hard, and recovery may be a long way away. Numerous analysts think it will take at least two years -- and maybe even longer -- for commercial aviation to return to pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile, most airline stocks have suspended their dividends, and some have even filed for bankruptcy protection. With that in mind, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to talk about the airline industry and industrials stock alternatives. They came back with Dow (NYSE:DOW), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), and Linde (NYSE:LIN). Here's why. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. John Bromels (Dow): The conventional wisdom right now calls for a recovery in 2022 or 2023. I think that's the most likely scenario for the airline industry, but there's still a lot of uncertainty and I wouldn't be surprised if that estimate ends up being way off base.  Instead of buying into uncertainty right now -- and there's a lot of that to go around, given current economic conditions -- I'm recommending buying into reliability and stability. For that, there's no better candidate than chemical company Dow.  Dow was spun off from the merged DowDuPont in 2019, with the company's ""performance chemicals"" portfolio and $20 billion in debt. Most of the chemicals in Dow's lineup aren't used on their own, but as components in various processes or products. These include coatings, paints, adhesives, lubricants, and packaging. As you can imagine, these components are used in a lot of different industries, which means the diversified young company churns out a reliable stream of cash flow. Dow has generated $6.5 billion in cash over the past year, which it's used to pay down about $2.4 billion of its debt load and fund its generous dividend, currently yielding 6.7%.  Dow's share price is down about 23% so far this year, but the company is still churning out cash thanks to high demand in the food packaging and healthcare sectors. Now looks like an excellent time to buy in. Lee Samaha (Raytheon Technologies): Aerospace investors should be under no illusions: The recovery in the commercial air travel market is going to take time. On a recent earnings call, defense contractor Raytheon's CEO Greg Hayes said he thinks ""it will take at least until 2023 for commercial air traffic to recover to 2019 levels."" It's a dynamic situation, and Hayes also recently outlined that","Aug 8, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/08/forget-airline-stocks-these-3-stocks-are-better-bu.aspx

Airline stocks could lead the equities market higher in the coming weeks – that is, if Covid-19 cases have actually peaked. By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment Airline stocks could be setting up for a massive rally in the weeks ahead despite concerns about a second wave of coronavirus cases in the autumn. The stock market is trading near all-time highs, leading many to question whether equities have become overvalued—but it’s worth noting that the rally has been driven mainly by a handful of tech companies. That leaves plenty of room to run for companies whose share prices haven’t seen much movement since the March dip. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors said he sees beaten down sectors making a sizable comeback shortly if coronavirus cases start to decline in the U.S. By Lee’s calculations, the stock market could climb 30% higher in just two weeks. Lee’s forecast assumes that coronavirus cases peaked on July 24. When cases stopped rising back in April, the stock market came roaring back to life 20 days later. Lee believes the same could be true this time around—and the twentieth day would be August 14. What’s more, Lee says history dictates that the stock market will recoup 2.5 times its March losses–implying an upside of 30% over the next few weeks: Since 1920, every stock market decline >35% saw a symmetric price recovery.  In other words, the faster the markets fall, the faster the markets recover, and the ratio is 2.5X.  Given","Aug 9, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/airline-stocks-deliver-30-upside-next-two-weeks-analyst/

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway grew profits by 86% last quarter as its stock portfolio soared in value. Selling stocks,"   Mario Anzuoni/Reuters  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a surge in profits in the second quarter as the soaring value of its stock portfolio offset weakness across much of its business due to the coronavirus pandemic. The famed investor's conglomerate also sold more than just the ""big four"" airline stocks last quarter, and added about $10 billion to its enormous cash pile. Berkshire reported an 11% slump in revenues to about $57 billion as sales dropped in both the ""insurance and other"" and ""railroad, utilities and energy"" divisions.

However, those declines were offset by close to $30 billion in year-on-year investment gains, meaning Berkshire's net income soared 86% to $26.3 billion. Berkshire reported $12.8 billion in net stock sales last quarter, including the $6.1 billion it received from selling the ""big four"" airline stocks in April. The conglomerate will publish its portfolio as of June 30 in a regulatory filing next week, detailing exactly which positions it sold down or exited.  As predicted, Buffett also repurchased more than $5 billion of Berkshire stock last quarter, a big step up from his $1.6 billion in buybacks during the first quarter.

11,Why Are Canadians Watching Moderna Stock Right Now? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why Are Canadians Watching Moderna Stock Right Now?. A rocketing stock for,"      Victoria Hetherington | August 9, 2020 | More on: MRNA It’s been a roller coaster of a fortnight for Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). But what is it about this stock that has the markets so excited? Sometimes it can be instructive for investors to check out which search terms are trending in Canada. “Moderna stock” was trending on Google midweek, with over 20,000 searches. But what is it about this stock that has Canadians flocking to the internet? And why did this stock fall 3.9%? Let’s take a quick look at why this stock is important at the moment, and why there might be better alternatives. Moderna is inching closer to a vaccine. It’s a key part of America’s Operation Warp Speed — an initiative driven by the crucial need for a solution to the coronavirus. But it fell this week on news that a rival vaccine could be considerably cheaper. The last time Moderna made headlines with a sizeable drop was on the news of a potential delay in trials. With other names also in the mix, investors should bet on one thing when it comes to a vaccine: governments are going to diversify. This means that vaccine supply chains are likely to be focused on more than one pharma outfit. As such, investors may want to take a flutter on several leading names. Stocks such as Pfizer are relevant here, while Novavax is closing in on its own vaccine candidate. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson could supply 100 million shots of its own vaccine in return for a cool US$1 billion. Per dosage, J&J’s vaccine is arguably more budget friendly than Moderna’s prospective offering. Other plays focus on different facets of the vaccine rollout. Corning is a play for its glassware, for instance, while Cargojet is a play for actual physical shipping of time-sensitive materials. Investors can alternatively eschew the vaccine play entirely and bet on an industrial recovery. Airline stocks, retail, and all things consumer are likely to see upticks in their performance. Energy stocks are also likely to see some improvement as energy usage increases and the market price of electricity rises. On the flipside, investors may wish to trim — or excise in their entirety — stocks that have become dangerously overvalued during the pandemic. This includes exemplary names such as Shopify. In fact, the online shopping tech giant is a prime","Aug 9, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/09/why-are-canadians-watching-moderna-stock-right-now/

13,Berkshire Bought Back Record $5 Billion of Stock Last Quarter,. . . . . . . . . . . . . BloombergQuint. Buffett Bought Back His Own Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. were left out of the stock market rally in the second quarter. Warren Buffett clearly thought the disconnect wasn’t warranted. The famed investor spent a record $5.1 billion buying back Berkshire’s own stock in the second quarter, more than double the amount he’d ever purchased before. That came as he unloaded almost $13 billion of other companies’ shares, including airline stocks and some financials, in what was his biggest selling quarter in more than a decade. Buffett has been building up cash this year and took a more cautious tone at his annual meeting in May as the Covid-19 pandemic has slammed the economy without putting a permanent dent in stock-market valuations. But his appetite for his own stock in the second quarter, along with recent signs that he’s been willing to put more money to work, are reasons for some optimism, according to Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. “The buybacks are a relatively safe way to deploy capital in an uncertain environment,” said Shanahan, who estimated that Berkshire repurchased another $2.4 billion of shares in July. “But it’s clear that that’s not all he’s doing.” Buffett’s cash pile surged to a record $146.6 billion at the end of June, in part from dumping all of his airline shares in April. He’s been more active lately, striking a deal for natural-gas assets in July and snapping up at least $2 billion of Bank of America Corp. stock in recent weeks through Aug. 4. Overall, Saturday’s disclosures signaled to longtime shareholder Bill Smead that Berkshire is a bit more certain about its standing in this volatile environment. “He sees that the company itself can get through the worst body blow,” said Smead, the chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, which oversees $1.5 billion including Berkshire shares. And his buybacks signal that “it got obvious to him how out of favor his own stock is in relation to other investments you could make in other companies.” Berkshire’s Class A shares, which fell in line with the S&P 500 in the first three months of the year as the pandemic spread in the U.S., fell another 1.7% last quarter while the broader index rallied 20%. Buffett said in early May that repurchases weren’t more compelling than at previous times, but the buybacks in the quarter suggest his thinking shifted.

","OMAHA, Neb. — Warren Buffett’s company reported an 87% jump in its second-quarter profit as the paper value of its investment portfolio increased with the stock market, but it took a roughly $10 billion write down on the value of its aircraft parts manufacturing business because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Saturday that it earned $26.3 billion, or $16,314 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That’s up from $14.1 billion, or $8,608 per share, a year ago. Berkshire said it cut the value of its Precision Castparts unit because of how much the pandemic has hurt air travel and businesses that support that airline industry. Precision Castparts cut about 10,000 jobs, or about 30% of its workforce, during the first half of the year as it responded to the reduced demand. CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert said the Precision Castparts write-down — combined with Berkshire’s sale of all its airline stocks earlier this year — suggests that Buffett expects the pandemic to have a lasting negative impact on the airline business. Buffett has long said Berkshire’s operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. They also exclude the Precision Castparts write down. By that measure, Berkshire’s operating earnings declined 10% to $5.5 billion, or $3,420.48 per Class A share, as most of its businesses were hurt by restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. That’s down from $6.1 billion, or $3,754.83 per share. The four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,182.06. The pandemic’s impact on Berkshire’s businesses was significant, but Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said it may not have been as bad as expected, partly because Geico insurance and BNSF railroad performed well during the quarter. Like all auto insurers, Geico benefited from lower claims because there were fewer accidents as people drove less with many people working from home. It reported a $2.1 billion underwriting profit in the quarter, up from $393 million a year ago. Also, a $2.5 billion in premium reductions Geico is offering customers because of the lower claims will be spread over the coming year as people renew policies instead of taking effect all in the second quarter when most other insurers sent refunds.

The," By Bill McGilton Buffett is currently seventh on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index – a daily ranking of the world’s richest people. The index lists his net worth at roughly $73 billion… and he earned it all through investing. The “Oracle of Omaha” invests through his conglomerate holding company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B), which he took over in 1965. Since then, Buffett has generated a compound annual return of around 20% per year on average while managing Berkshire’s investments. Every $10,000 investment in Berkshire Hathaway at the start of 1965 was worth $274 million at the end of 2019. While he’s widely recognized as one of the greatest investors of all time, not every investment turns out well for Buffett. When the COVID-19 pandemic cropped up earlier this year, it crushed one of his biggest investment ideas. You see, Buffett has a problem… He’s a self-admitted “aeroholic.” As he told British newspaper The Telegraph in a September 2002 interview… If a capitalist had been present at Kittyhawk back in the early 1900s, he should have shot Orville Wright. He would have saved his progeny money. But seriously, the airline business has been extraordinary. It has eaten up capital over the past century like almost no other business because people seem to keep coming back to it and putting fresh money in. You’ve got huge fixed costs, you’ve got strong labor unions, and you’ve got commodity pricing. That is not a great recipe for success. I have an 800 number now that I call if I get the urge to buy an airline stock. I call at two in the morning and I say: “My name is Warren, and I’m an aeroholic.” And then they talk me down. At the time of the interview, Buffett was referring to Berkshire Hathaway’s 1989 $358 million investment in convertible preferred stock of USAir – later renamed US Airways and now a part of American Airlines.

It’s hard not to notice when Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A and BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett makes any kind of move. He’s faced sharp criticisms against his investment style over the last ten years or so. The S&P 500 acts as the benchmark measurement of the overall stock market – throughout this last decade, its gained 197%. Berkshire Hathaway, on the other hand, has gained “just” 151% – making the portfolio appear underperforming by 46 percentage points. But Buffett is know for thinking long term – and ten years isn’t that long when gauging investment performance. It’s no secret – Buffett has faced a bad 2020 in terms of his investments. That is, until now. The golden child of the S&P – Apple – just earned Buffett the warrior status he’s best known for. And has more than made up for what many analysts consider a year of tragic missteps for the investor. Investors are worried about Apple’s weighting in the S&P. Apple stands at a 6.4% weighting – greater than any of the other single stocks in the index. And this includes such heavy hitters as Microsoft (5.8%) and Amazon (4.9%). Sure, Buffett has tripped and skinned his knees on some of the S&P 500 bets he’s made. In June, Buffett’s stake in Bank of America was down 29% – over $10 billion. His other losses included:  But these losses are nothing compared to Apple’s gains. Berkshire Hathaway’s public portfolio as of June 2020 was up more than $600 million – in large part due to his shareholding in Apple. June’s profit report showed Apple soared an incredible 49% for the first half of 2020. If this trend continues, Apple isn’t far from striking a prized market value of $2 trillion. This is fantastic news for Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway – over 45% of BH’s portfolio is all-in on Apple.  So, what does this look like on paper? Just since May 1, 2020, the Berkshire Hathaway valuation is up $36 billion. This is an extremely important date – this is right around the time that Buffett quickly got out of his shares of airline stock. And Apple’s portion of this increased valuation? Nearly the entire uptick! Buffett gained $35 billion in Apple alone. Apple is also the only holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio that rose by double digits for the year.
