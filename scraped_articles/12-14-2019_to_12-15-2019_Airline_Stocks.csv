Sign up for Medium and get an extra one.,"This project was authored by Alex Hoganson, Dale Pedzinski and Lydia Guarino as part of an introductory ML class at the University of Texas under the guidance of professor Alex Dimakis. Our datasets and analysis can be found on data.world and github. We link to our relevant code and datasets throughout this post. The US Bureau of Transportation Statistics makes a wealth of aviation data available for public download. Our team was inspired by the richness of these flight statistics and became curious about the application of using publicly available data to predict something valuable about individual airline carriers. We worked from the following question: Can we create a Machine Learning model to predict airline stock price or revenue using public aviation data? To answer this question, we worked through 4 experiments. 2 were flops and 2 were wins. Our best performing experiment produced an average percent error of just 2.5% when estimating quarterly revenues, rivaling Wall Street’s revenue estimate consensus. Further refinements that applied the WS projections as a feature dropped the average percent error even further, to 0.95%. Below, we walk through the specifics of each of these experiments. We began with flight statistics for 7 major airlines spanning 2010–2019. Our hypothesis was that flight statistics such as passenger volume could be used as a proxy for demand. We added fuel expenditure stats as a proxy for monthly operating expenses and finally compiled monthly stock data for each airline to use in a supervised linear regression model. While this exercise was valuable in exploring tools, practicing data manipulation, and leveling up matplotlib skills, it was quickly evident that there was insufficient correlation between our features and stock price. Flight statistics, it seems, were not a good fit for stock price prediction, which has deep roots in human psychology. Working from the idea that stock price might have better correlations with market sentiment, we decided to explore whether we could predict stock inflection from an NLP sentiment analysis of tweets referencing a particular airline. Some initial research surfaced support that sentiment analysis performed on tweet corpora had been used in several academic studies to predict stock behavior. To focus our research, we chose to dive deep on just one airline — Southwest Airlines. We made this selection based on their middle-of-the-pack stock price and also because they hold the largest US fleet of Boeing 737 Max Jets.

1,"Investors are 'scared to death,' top strategist says","Investors are ‘scared to death’ of the bull market ending, top strategist says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC","Stocks may be at highs, but investors could be acting overly cautious heading into 2020. Even more than that, they are acting as though they are “scared to death,” says Jeff Saut, chief investment strategist at Capital Wealth Planning. He says most of the investors he talks to fear what may come in the new year. Saut, however, reassures them it’s not yet time for the secular bull market to end. “Secular bull markets tend to run 15 to 20 years. They’re not interrupted by 20% to 30% declines,” said Saut on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “The 1949-1966 secular bull market had a 30% decline when you had the Jack Kennedy steel crisis in 1962. The 1982-2000 secular bull market had the 1987 crash, but the bull market went on for another 13 years, so I think we’ve got years left on the upside.” Stocks had a mixed day on Friday after the U.S. and China reached a phase one trade deal. The agreement includes some tariff relief, increased agricultural purchases, and structural change to intellectual property and technology issues. Saut explained that while markets endured a back-and-forth on Friday, he’s still bullish heading into the new year. “The market has crossed over between plus and minus so often today the only way to make money was to erect a toll booth at even,” said Saut. “You’ve got the seasonality tailwinds. … Central banks of the world are printing money and that’s all you really need to know. ... Going into year-end, I think the market trades higher. … I think next year you can see between 3500 to 3600 on the S&P 500.” At the high end, that implies 13% upside from current levels. Saut also pinpoints one section of the market he sees continuing to break out in the new year. “You have what a technical analysis would call a golden cross, where the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average on the Russell 2000 Small Cap index on Nov. 5th. The Small Caps have actually done pretty well since then, and it’s not just the U.S. Small Caps. The European Small Caps had a similar golden cross on October 28th and they’ve done really well,” said Saut. The IWM ETF, which tracks the Russell 2000, is up 22% this year. The group began to participate more fully in the broader market rally this month.","Dec 15, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/16/investors-are-scared-to-death-top-strategist-says.html

Despite the company's growing track record of consistently strong,"   Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has been a consistent outperformer in the airline industry in recent years. The airline has won a loyal following due to its industry-leading reliability and a reputation for good service. It also has a dominant position in its three biggest hub markets: Atlanta, Detroit, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. As a result, Delta has reliably produced strong earnings and free cash flow over the past five years. At the company's investor day on Thursday, management predicted that 2020 will be another year of profit growth and solid free cash flow. That makes Delta Air Lines stock look like a great bargain at its current valuation of just eight times earnings. Delta Air Lines has delivered strong earnings growth over the past decade. Most dramatically, adjusted pre-tax income more than doubled from less than $2 billion in 2011 to $4.5 billion by 2014 as Delta honed its revenue-generation capabilities. As a result, the stock surged from around $8 at the beginning of 2012 to nearly $50 by the end of 2014. EPS has continued to rise since then, driven by lower fuel prices, the reduction of the federal tax rate, share buybacks, and further progress on differentiating Delta's products and services to improve its pricing power. Adjusted EPS is on track to end up around $7 in 2019, more than double its 2014 level. Despite this continued EPS growth, Delta stock has stalled out, spending the last five years oscillating between $40 and $60.  DELTA AIR LINES STOCK PERFORMANCE. DATA BY YCHARTS. This multiple compression is a strong indication that investors don't think Delta's current level of profitability and cash flow is sustainable. However, Delta Air Lines shows no sign of faltering. Back in October, Delta spooked investors when it projected a sharp slowdown in earnings growth for the fourth quarter -- even though much of the slowdown was related to one-time factors -- and stated that adjusted nonfuel unit costs were likely to rise 2% to 3% in 2020. But at the company's recent investor day, management provided a much more optimistic outlook. First, while Delta does face cost headwinds from higher pay and other staffing investments to support growth, the carrier expects that fuel efficiency will improve by about 2% and pension costs will decline significantly due to strong asset returns in 2019. These factors will help mitigate the airline's underlying cost headwinds.","Dec 14, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/14/delta-air-lines-predicts-that-2020-will-be-another.aspx
3,Boeing Maintains Supremacy Over Airbus at United Airlines Despite A321XLR Order | The Motley Fool,Boeing Maintains Supremacy Over Airbus at United Airlines Despite A321XLR Order. One of the biggest 737 MAX customers just ordered,"   United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is one of the biggest customers for Boeing's (NYSE:BA) troubled 737 MAX family of single-aisle jets. Through a series of orders and conversions, the global airline has accumulated 171 firm orders for the 737 MAX -- mainly for the largest model, the 737 MAX 10 -- in addition to the 14 737 MAX 9s already in its fleet. By contrast, as of the end of last quarter, it had no orders for the competing Airbus (OTC:EADSY) A320neo family. That changed earlier this month, as United Airlines ordered 50 Airbus A321XLRs, the longest-range version of the A321neo. Nevertheless, Boeing is well positioned to maintain its primacy in United's fleet for the foreseeable future. The A321XLR jets that United ordered earlier this month will mainly replace the carrier's aging Boeing 757 fleet on longer-haul routes, mainly trans-Atlantic ones. Their superior range and lower fuel burn will also allow United to open new routes that weren't viable previously. This order was expected, because the Airbus A321XLR is by far the closest replacement for the 757. While the 737 MAX 10 is similar in size, it doesn't have true trans-Atlantic range. Meanwhile, the 787-8, the next largest plane in Boeing's lineup, is dramatically bigger than the 757 and built to fly twice as far, which adds unnecessary costs on 3,500-4,000 mile trans-Atlantic routes. UNITED AIRLINES ORDERED 50 AIRBUS A321XLRS EARLIER THIS MONTH. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. The big question for investors is whether the A321XLR order will pave the way for additional A320neo family orders. Back in early 2016, it seemed possible that United was on its way to phasing out all of its Airbus narrow-body jets by the mid-2020s, moving to an all-737 narrow-body fleet. Now, it is clear that the A320neo family will be part of United's fleet for decades, which could justify additional orders to gain scale in that fleet type. In this context, it's noteworthy that United Airlines' A321XLR order wasn't combined with orders for other members of the A320neo family. If United had been looking to diversify away from the 737 family, especially the 737 MAX, placing a larger order with Airbus, including standard A321neos and A320neos -- and possibly even A319neos -- would have made a ton of sense. Instead, it appears that the 737 MAX will be the main tool for replacing older and smaller jets in United's fleet and for","Dec 15, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/15/boeing-maintains-supremacy-over-airbus-at-united-a.aspx

USD/JPY.,"                                                   This article is written for those who want to get better at using price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). To keep it practical, we'll show how American Airlines Group Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAL) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. What is American Airlines Group's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 7.75. That means that at current prices, buyers pay $7.75 for every $1 in trailing yearly profits. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group The formula for P/E is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for American Airlines Group: P/E of 7.75 = $27.48 ÷ $3.55 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.) A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E. We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. If you look at the image below, you can see American Airlines Group has a lower P/E than the average (8.9) in the airlines industry classification. This suggests that market participants think American Airlines Group will underperform other companies in its industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling. If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.

Last Updated at December 14, 2019 00:35 IST Indian airlines will post a combined loss of $600 million and induct fewer aircraft in the current financial year, aviation consultancy CAPA said in its latest report. CAPA has revised its earnings estimate for Indian carriers from its June forecast of $500-700 million in profit, following weak results by market leader IndiGo and SpiceJet. The two carriers posted losses of Rs 1,062 crore and Rs 462 crore, respectively, in the September quarter. Aggressive expansion, coupled with price wars, and an increase in maintenance costs, has also hit cash flows. “Most carriers except IndiGo continue to be precariously placed, with cash balances available, in some cases, to cover only a few days or weeks of expenses,” said CAPA. CAPA expects IndiGo to post an annual profit of $70-90 million — far lower than the $400-500 million guided for in June — given the changes in accounting norms and increased provisioning on aircraft maintenance. SpiceJet could be headed for a second year of loss after posting its weakest quarterly results since 2015, it added. AirAsia India, Vistara, and Air India are also on course to posting losses for the year, though GoAir is expected to register a $25-30 million profit. CAPA estimates Air India to post a loss of $500 million this year, due to the grounding of over 20 aircraft and its inability to capitalise on Jet Airways’ closure. “Potential benefits of consolidation and capacity rationalisation in the wake of Jet’s demise, as well as relatively benign fuel prices, have largely been squandered. Carriers pursued very aggressive expansion in an effort to capture slots released by Jet, resulting in downward pressure on yields,” CAPA said. Domestic air traffic grew 11 per cent in November — the first double-digit growth month in CY20 — on lower fares and recovery of lost capacity, following Jet’s closure. Domestic carriers operated a total of 628 aircraft in November, up from 614 in January. Fresh capacity addition, however, has been muted because of the challenges surrounding Airbus A320neo engines,","Dec 14, 2019",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/indian-airlines-set-for-600-million-loss-in-fy20-says-capa-report-119121400029_1.html

8,Is JetBlue Airways Corporation's (NASDAQ:JBLU) 12% ROE Worse Than Average? - Simply Wall St News,Is JetBlue Airways Corporation's (NASDAQ:JBLU) 12% ROE Worse Than Average?. How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?. What Does Return,"Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU), by way of a worked example. Over the last twelve months JetBlue Airways has recorded a ROE of 12%. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated $0.12 in profit. See our latest analysis for JetBlue Airways The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders' Equity Or for JetBlue Airways: 12% = US$577m ÷ US$4.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.) Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets. Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses. Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, JetBlue Airways has a lower ROE than the average (18%) in the Airlines industry classification. That certainly isn't ideal. We prefer it when the ROE of a company is above the industry average, but it's not the be-all and end-all if it is lower. Nonetheless, it might be wise to check if insiders have been selling. Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk","Dec 15, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-jblu/jetblue-airways/news/is-jetblue-airways-corporations-nasdaqjblu-12-roe-worse-than-average
