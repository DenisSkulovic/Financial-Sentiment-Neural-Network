2,This Stock Could Be the Airline Industry's Worst Enemy | The Motley Fool,"This Stock Could Be the Airline Industry's Worst Enemy. Business travel rebound is a must, but video conferencing may put","   The travel industry has been deeply affected by COVID-19. Global travel has ground to a halt, and for the time being the pandemic has put the kibosh on an airline industry recovery. However, many households -- myself included -- are itching for a vacation. Some investors have thus dumped money into airline stocks on the expectation that travelers will come back with a vengeance once the coast is clear. However, the emergence of Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) and other video conferencing services makes me think the airline industry will never be the same. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. It's no shock that airline stocks are struggling right now. Delta (NYSE:DAL), for example, reported an 88% drop in revenue during the spring 2020 quarter ended June 30, driven by a 94% evaporation of its passenger ticket sales. Airlines are scrambling to cut costs until the situation improves, but it's taking much longer than anticipated.   But the situation is temporary, right? I'm not so sure. While I believe leisure travel will make a rebound in 2021 -- assuming there's a vaccine, treatment, and subsequent taming of the novel coronavirus -- it's important to understand how airlines make money. Pre-pandemic, business passengers were estimated to be about 12% of the total. However, those minority passengers accounted for as much as 75% of profits. The reason is that business-related travelers typically spend more -- like on upgraded seats, last-minute bookings, itinerary changes, and other services. Let's use Delta as an example again. Of the $42.3 million in passenger ticket revenue the company generated in 2019, $15.0 million of it (or 35%) was attributed to business cabin and premium tickets. That doesn't include those business travelers who opted to fly via the main cabin with the rest of the masses. In Delta's latest quarter, business cabin tickets fell 95% from a year ago, in lockstep with main cabin tickets. Business travel will surely start to come back along with leisure travel as the effects of the pandemic ease, but I think the lucrative business segment recovery will be a far slower affair. Long term, COVID-19 won't be the airlines' worst enemy -- it will be Zoom and a number of other digital tools that have been booming in recent months.  A big reason stock indices like the S&P 500 are back to making new all-time highs -- even as the","Aug 30, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/30/this-stock-could-be-airline-industrys-worst-enemy/

Southwest,"Air Market Group  When we look at our portfolio of Aerospace stocks, the airlines always tend to stick out a bit more than some of the other companies who’s name may not be as well recognized in the public.

These top 5 airlines will each behave similarly as they are each in the same business of transporting goods and people around the world. Although it is important to respect each individuality.

4,SAVE Stock: Why It's Clear Skies Ahead for Spirit Airlines | InvestorPlace,"Why It’s Clear Skies Ahead for Spirit Airlines Stock. Air travel isn't going anywhere, and SAVE stock is the best"," It’s still a long road ahead, but airlines are slowly coming back. And, among the various airline stocks out there, few hold a candle to Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) stock. The best value in the sector, this low-cost carrier stands a greater chance of getting “back to normal” sooner than legacy rivals like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL). Not only that, Spirit is well ahead when it comes to minimizing cash burn. In fact, this airline basically broke even back in June. Granted, “break-even” doesn’t sound like smashing success. But, considering carriers like American burned through $40 million per day that month, this carrier may be knocking it out of the park by comparison. Add in its strong liquidity position, and it’s clear this remains one of the best ways to play the inevitable airline recovery. Once the novel coronavirus is over and done with, low-cost names like this one aren’t going to just survive but thrive as well. And with shares holding steady around $18 per share, today’s price level is the perfect entry point. Since the outbreak first hit the U.S., there has been many false starts for a recovery. Back in June, investors rushed back into airline stocks on the hopes of a faster-than-expected recovery. But a surge in cases across the country brought that excitement to a halt. Now, with positive developments regarding cases and a vaccine, travel demand could see a boost this fall. Air traffic levels have improved since bottoming out in the spring. But domestic traffic remains down 70% year-over-year. All bets are off whether this means a rapid increase in traffic from now through the end of 2020. But the situation is improving, not getting worse. As InvestorPlace’s David Moadel wrote, that’s clear from the TSA daily screening numbers that are trending higher. But what does this all mean for investors looking for opportunity in this hard-hit sector? Firstly, some carriers are going to bounce back sooner than the rest. Namely, low-cost names like Spirit Airlines. Between its lower cost structure, strong balance sheet, and lack of exposure to harder-hit segments of the travel market, low-cost airlines have an edge when it comes to staging a comeback. And that may be the key to this stock’s success over the next year. Many investors may see opportunity making airline comeback plays by buying beaten-down legacy carriers like American,","Aug 31, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/clear-skies-ahead-save-stock/

6,American Airlines CEO Still Thinks Buying Back Stock Was A Good Idea - View from the Wing,American Airlines CEO Still Thinks Buying Back Stock Was A Good Idea. More From View from the Wing. Financial Analysts,"by Gary Leff on August 31, 2020 After taking over at American Airlines, management spent $12.4 billion buying back stock over a six year period at an average price of $39.76 per share. Now they’re facing over $40 billion in debt and looking for a second government bailout this year. At an internal Crew News session at the end of last week, a pilot asked the airline’s CEO Doug Parker if the airline is able to claw its way back, whether he’d change the way the airline is run – paying down debt instead of buying stock?  Parker answering the pilot by explaining his September 2017 claim that American Airlines would never lose money again, saying that he wasn’t foreseeing an event as severe as what they’re experiencing, but suggested that their financial decisions made sense against the backdrop he expected – one in which they’d even still make money in a crisis like the Great Recession (he doesn’t explain why, but it’s the credit card revenue not the flying). He then suggests they made billions of dollars in profit, and invested heavily in the company from aircraft to facilities, and then they had money left and bought back stock. He says they borrowed for the aircraft “because it was really efficient borrowing.” Despite profits, though, American Airlines had negative free cash flow. They were borrowing money and giving cash to stockholders. They were in effect buying back their stock with borrowed money. and Parker explains it as being because interest rates were low. He turned American Airlines into a financing company that flew planes. Before the Covid crisis American was financially underperforming the industry. They earned lower revenues for their flying (having chased away their frequent customers) and had much greater capital expenses. Now it’s precisely that borrowed money that’s the problem, rather than the buy backs per se. The debt burden is why American is the airline with the greatest risk of not paying back its unsecured creditors. The airline has $40 billion worth of debt, even before adding government-subsidized CARES Act loans they plan to pledge the AAdvantage program as collateral in order to get.

7,Warren Buffett: Is Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock a Value Trap? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Warren Buffett: Is Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock a Value Trap?. Buffett: The,"      Puja Tayal | August 31, 2020 | More on: AC Back in April, when the Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett exited his entire position in the airline industry, it created an uproar in the market. The airline stocks had already lost more than 60% of their values. Rarely does Buffett sell stocks in haste. He is a long-term investor who buys stocks that he stays invested in for decades. Then why did he sell it when the stocks bottomed out? It is because the reason he bought the airline stocks was gone and was unlikely to return in the coming 10 years. Buffett invested in airline stocks when they were growing. Airlines were making profits and earning positive cash flows for over three consecutive years. He expected that more people would fly and airlines would continue to repurchase shares to maintain their stock valuations. But when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted air travel and grounded 90% of airlines’ capacities, all his expectations came crashing down. Warren Buffett said, “The world has changed for the airlines.” The surge in air travel demand came to a screeching halt, with no way to predict what lies ahead. The international borders were closed for three months. The U.S.-Canada border is closed for six months. The pandemic has changed people’s habits. Buffett always looks at a business from the angle of whether or not people will use those products or services. With the pandemic, he wasn’t sure whether or not people would fly frequently. Uncertainty is something that investors hate. They invest in the future, and they want to be sure that there is a sizable amount of growth. When Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock lost 75% of its valuation in less than a month, some investors believed it to be an attractive point to buy a value stock. The airline had strengthened its fundamentals over its growth years (2013-2019). At the end of 2019, it had $1.48 billion in net income, 19% in adjusted EBITDA margin, $2 billion in free cash flows, and $2.84 billion in net debt. Hence, when the AC stock dropped by 75% in the March sell-off, its valuation fell from 8.1 times its earnings per share to 2.3 times. This was the biggest value trap, and Buffett identified it. This was just a momentary valuation, as the airline’s fundamentals nosedived by the time it reported its","Aug 31, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/31/warren-buffett-is-air-canada-tsxac-stock-a-value-trap/
8,Is Air Canada Stock a Buy in September? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Is Air Canada Stock a Buy in September?. A Chinese recovery and,"      Brian Paradza, CFA | August 31, 2020 | More on: AC The outlook for global airline stocks, including Air Canada (TSX:AC), remained densely clouded in August. However, there was a small glimmer of hope in another industry news piece during the past week. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 290 airlines comprising 82% of global air traffic, warned on July 28 that global passenger numbers could return to pre-pandemic levels by 2024, a year later than previously projected. The news dented airline stock investors’ spirits — more so when it was pointed out that international travel, which comprises about two-thirds of global aviation revenue, remains at just 2-4% of pre-pandemic levels. However, domestic travel is picking up some recovery pace — more so in China, where domestic arrivals at Chinese airports reportedly reached 86% of 2019 levels in August. More flights were re-instated during the second quarter of this year, as coronavirus cases declined in the Asian country. Even more encouraging, domestic flight bookings in China are reportedly back to 98% of 2019 levels and could fully recover by early September this year. The truth is, China’s recovery is happening within just six months after planes were grounded and blanket travel bans were put in place across the country in efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. If domestic markets could recover as fast as the Chinese one post-lockdowns, airline cash flow bleeds could be reduced by small margins. And some jobs could be saved across the aviation industry, including at Air Canada. That said, the bulk of the air travel business is from servicing international routes. But cross-border travel bans remain in place, and international travel remains severely subdued between 2% to 4% of pre-COVID-19 levels. If IATA’s 2024 prediction comes to pass, a good number of airlines will require government bailouts to avoid bankruptcy. Air Canada stock was badly hit by the COVID-19 market crash in April. Its share price remains 63% down year to date. Revenue took an 89% hit last quarter, but there are small signs of business recovery this quarter. The Canadian airline plans to increase its planned weekly flights in September by just over 24% from August levels. Its serviced routes increased from 58 in June to 91 by month-end of August. The majority of operated flights remain domestic ones. Encouragingly, weekly flights to Europe, the","Aug 31, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/31/is-air-canada-stock-a-buy-in-september/

12,Airline Industry Shrink to Adapt to Coronavirus Crisis,Airline Industry Shrink to Adapt to Coronavirus Crisis. Most Recent News. First Direct Commercial Flight from Israel to UAE Land," By Amanda Collins In March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic rattled the global air travel industry, most of the airlines believed a few weeks or months of lockdown would eliminate the virus. And thus, held on to their assets and employees despite heavy losses. By July 2020, airline executives concluded the crisis is here to stay, and they need to shrink to survive the crisis. Airlines boosted liquidity and accessed government funds to tide over what was perceived to be a “short-term” crisis but held-off from large scale layoffs in the hope of travel demand returning from October 2020. Some of the government financing, such as the CARES Act PSP, required no firings until the end of September. The change in situation combined with the forecast that some business travel will never return is prompting airlines to shrink in size as fast as possible. Airlines are moving quickly and are preparing to offload excess equipment, personal, and resources, which could be brought back as the demand picks up gradually. Read: Top 4 Airlines That Will Survive the Covid-19 Crisis No Matter What Most airlines across the world are retiring planes, breaking aircraft lease contracts, terminating already furloughed employees, shutting lounges, closing bases, canceling routes or reducing frequencies, reducing staff salaries, or putting them on reduced working hours to adapt to the downturn. Airlines typically lease their aircraft requirements except for very few like Ryanair, which owns much of their fleet. Leasing gives airlines the flexibility to upgrade or change aircraft according to demand. However, breaking these contracts often comes with hefty penalties. Airlines are now taking the plunge seeing demand will never be the same for the next several years, and holding on to these grounded assets is a mistake. Previously, when the going went tough, airlines cut costs aggressively, which always did not translate to reducing capacity. Instead, it was aimed at trimming excess fat and optimizing operations. In the era of Coronavirus, airlines are shrinking current bloated resources in response to the lack of sustainable demand for the foreseeable future. Airlines are also laying off thousands of people – at least 75,000 jobs are expected to be lost in the US alone starting 1st Oct once the CARES Act payroll support program ends unless Congress approves another bailout package which the airlines have asked for to avoid layoffs.

Tesla and Apple both climbed amid heavy trading volume in the first session since the companies’ respective stock splits. The Dow and S&P 500 both locked in their best August in more than 30 years.  Here’s what’s happened.  The Dow fell shortly before the close to finish roughly 230 points, or 0.8%, lower. The S&P 500 fell slightly, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7%. By avoiding a sharp selloff on Monday, the Dow and S&P 500 clinched their best August since 1984 and 1986, respectively. — Jesse Pound Correction: The S&P 500 had its best August since 1986. An earlier version misstated the year. The major averages were mixed with one hour left in the session as Wall Street wrapped up its best August since 1984. The S&P 500 was up marginally while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 185 points, or 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced more than 1%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow were up more than 7% for their biggest August rally since 1984. — Fred Imbert Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust/Truist Advisory, pointed out the S&P 500 was on pace for just its 27th five-month winning streak since 1950. In 96% of those previous instances, the S&P 500 has sported a gain the following year. “This is consistent with other studies … that provide evidence that strong momentum in the first stage of a bull market is common and typically a good longer-term sign,” said Lerner. “However, it is notable that after such strong monthly winning streaks, near-term stock returns tend to moderate as one would expect.” —Fred Imbert The major indexes were mixed on Monday afternoon, but the first day of the week has typically been the strongest day of the week during the market’s rally off the lows, according to Jefferies. The firm called the phenomenon “Monday seasonality” in a new note to clients. “Since April, there has been a distinct pattern of stock buying on Mondays. 93% of times stocks have rallied on Mondays with no obvious pattern in any other day of the week ... with almost three quarters of positive performance happening on Mondays,” the note said.

(NASDAQ: UAL) CEO Scott Kirby on Sunday announced the company was permanently eliminating ticket change fees for a majority of its customers for flights within the United States. What Happened: The Chicago-based airline's customers with ""Economy,"" ""Economy Plus,"" ""United First,"" ""United Business,"" and ""United Premium Plus"" will no longer be charged the $200 ticker change fees, for flights within the country, including continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, starting January next year. United customers, including holders of ""Basic Economy"" tickets and international travelers, can already change flights at no cost through the rest of this year, under a program announced earlier, according to the company. “When we hear from customers about where we can improve — getting rid of fees is often the top request,” Kirby said in a video statement. ""That's why we are taking this moment to become the first U.S. legacy airline to get rid of this fee for ever."" ""United is the only U.S. airline that will let all customers fly same-day standby for free,"" Kirby added. Why It Matters: The move comes at a time when the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has rattled the industry, with demand for air travel dropping signficantly. United announced Thursday it will furlough 2,850 pilots between Oct. 1 and  Nov. 30 this year, its largest such cut in history, according to Reuters. Rival Southwest Airlines Co.
