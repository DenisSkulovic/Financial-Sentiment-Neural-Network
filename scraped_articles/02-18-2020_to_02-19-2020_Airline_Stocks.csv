2,16 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying and Selling | Kiplinger,"Save up to 67%. 16 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying and Selling. Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway","Getty Images Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), oversaw a fairly busy fourth quarter of buying and selling stocks. Berkshire made new investments in the retail and biotechnology sectors, all but dumped a couple of big names and even jumped on the index-investing bandwagon. We know what the greatest long-term investor of all time has been doing because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires all investment managers with more than $100 million in assets to file a Form 13F quarterly to disclose any changes in share ownership. These filings add an important level of transparency to the stock market and give Buffett-ologists a chance to get a bead on what he's thinking. When Buffett starts a new stake in some company, or adds to an existing one, investors take that as a vote of confidence. On the other hand, if he pares his holdings in a stock, it can spark investors to rethink their own investments. Here's the scorecard for what Berkshire Hathaway bought and sold during the three months ended Dec. 31, 2019, based on the most recent 13F that the company filed on Feb. 14. And remember: Not all ""Warren Buffett stocks"" are actually his picks. Some smaller positions are believed to be handled by lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. 1 of 16 Getty Images Buffett is clearly a big believer in Occidental Petroleum (OXY, $41.60). BRK.B more than doubled its stake in the integrated oil-and-gas company. Indeed, the increase of 11,465,546 shares increased Berkshire's holdings by more than 150%. The holding company now owns 2.53% of Occidental's shares outstanding. Warren Buffett first bought OXY in the third quarter of 2019, and at the time, it was actually his second deal in 2019 to acquire equity in the company. Buffett first invested $10 billion in Occidental in late April 2019 to help finance a $38 billion bid for exploration-and-production firm Anadarko Petroleum. In return, Berkshire received 100,000 preferred shares yielding 8%. The bid beat out a competing offer from Chevron (CVX) but irked fellow octogenarian billionaire Carl Icahn, who owns a 5% stake in OXY. He called the acquisition ""hugely overpriced"" and still is fighting the deal. The now-larger stake is nonetheless a meager portion of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, which is notably light on energy overall. Buffett's avoidance of the sector might have stemmed from the great oil price crash of 2014.","Feb 18, 2020",https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-16-stocks-warren-buffett-is-buying-selling-2019-q4/index.html

Q4 and,"      Kay Ng | February 18, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) stock is a Canadian success story. The airline almost went bankrupt and traded below $1 per share about 11 years ago. However, it has miraculously turned around and generated tremendous value for its shareholders. Even if you had bought the stock at $8 per share when it showed signs of turning around, you’d still be sitting on a five-bagger! In the last 12 months alone, the value stock appreciated 35%, handily beating the TSX index.  AC data by YCharts. When bought opportunistically, airlines like Air Canada stock can be exceptional winners in your portfolio!  AC data by YCharts. The company just reported its fourth-quarter and 2019 results today and gave a little more clarity on the coronavirus outbreak’s impact on the company. In Q4, Air Canada’s operating revenues increased by 5% to $4.4 billion. The operating margin fell 90 basis points to 3.3%, which triggered 19% lower operating income year over year to $145 million. However, the EBITDA margin improved 40 basis points to 15%, boosting EBITDA by 7% to $665 million. Adjusted earnings per share fell 15% to $0.17 year over year. For 2019, the company reported operating revenues of $19 billion, an increase of 6% against 2018. The operating margin improved 30 basis points to 8.6%, which helped operating income climb 10% year over year to more than $1.6 billion. Additionally, the EBITDA margin improved by 120 basis points to 19%, boosting EBITDA by 13% to $3.6 billion. Ultimately, this resulted in adjusted earnings per share rising 26% to $3.37 in 2019. Airlines certainly have value right now, seeing that value investing guru Warren Buffett holds at four airlines via Berkshire Hathaway, though he doesn’t hold Air Canada specifically. At writing, Air Canada stock trades at about $45 per share, which is a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of about 13.4. Meanwhile, the airline is estimated to experience long-term double-digit growth. In fact, analysts have an average 12-month price target of $57.20 on the stock for market-beating upside potential of 27%. So, the stock trades at a decent valuation for long-term investment.

11,There's No Doubt Anymore: Buffett Thinks Stocks Are Grossly Overvalued | The Motley Fool,There's No Doubt Anymore: Buffett Thinks Stocks Are Grossly Overvalued. Berkshire Hathaway's latest 13F speaks volumes about Warren Buffett's take,"   Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett is easily one of the greatest investors of our time. In 65 years, he's grown his net worth from $10,000 to more than $89 billion, all while creating more than $400 billion in value for Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders over a more than five-decade stretch. Given Buffett's stock-picking prowess, he's also someone that Wall Street and retail investors look to for guidance as to where the broader market and certain core sectors/industries may be headed next. Berkshire's quarterly 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission provide that intimate look under the hood, so to speak, and allows us inside access to what the greatest mind on Wall Street has been up to in recent months. On Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, Berkshire Hathaway filed its latest 13F for the fourth quarter. Unfortunately for investors, there was little to love.  If there was any question as to whether Buffett still views equities as overvalued -- he referred to the valuations of businesses ""possessing decent long-term prospects"" as ""sky-high"" in Berkshire's 2019 annual shareholder letter -- the latest 13F absolutely confirmed it. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY CEO WARREN BUFFETT AT HIS COMPANY'S ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING. IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL. The most telltale sign that Warren Buffett is no fan of stocks at the moment can be seen when comparing the amount of stock sold to what was purchased during the fourth quarter. Although Berkshire added or bought into eight equities and reduced its position in an equal number of companies, there was a huge disparity on the sell side of the equation compared to the buy side. Although we don't know the exact price Buffett bought and sold these companies, I utilized their closing values on Dec. 31 to estimate how much capital was put to work versus how much was freed up via selling. On the buy side, Berkshire Hathaway purchased around $1.58 billion worth of stock. The newly added supermarket giant Kroger accounted for the largest portion of this ($549.1 million), with Occidental Petroleum trailing fairly closely behind ($472.5 million). Comparatively, Buffett and his team sold approximately $7 billion worth of stock during the fourth quarter, or more than four times the amount of stock that was purchased. In fact, the five largest sells -- Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Goldman Sachs, Apple, Travelers Cos., and Phillips 66 -- equaled a higher dollar value","Feb 18, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/18/theres-no-doubt-anymore-buffett-thinks-stocks-are.aspx

13,Southwest Airlines is a better Investment option than JetBlue Airways. Here's why | AlphaStreet,JetBlue (JBLU) vs. Southwest Airlines (LUV): Which stock is a better buy?. . Is Southwest a Buy?. Q4 Outcome. Most,"News . Data . Research Categories Analysis, Industrials JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) and Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) have many things in common, and one of them is their emergence as the most popular low-cost carriers in the U.S. The companies might need to revisit their hitherto-successful business model, in response to the rapid transformation the aviation industry is witnessing. Being the more established player among the two, Southwest’s market value is much higher compared to JetBlue. Casual investors would find the latter more attractive due to the cheaper share price. At $21, JetBlue shares traded lower during Tuesday’s session, after gaining 23% in the past twelve months. Southwest shares witnessed a great deal of volatility since last year but maintained their modest uptick during that period. The stock closed the last session at $57.97. The country’s legacy carriers are already in the innovation mode, so as to deal with the rising costs and aging fleets. The growing competition would prompt Southwest and JetBlue to think beyond their low ticket prices to stay relevant. Rising unit costs have narrowed the companies’ operational advantage over their legacy counterparts. Related: Southwest Airlines Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript Southwest flies to a significantly higher number of passengers to bigger cities, compared to JetBlue, which helps the company monetize its services effectively. At the same time, it is more prone to setbacks when things go wrong, such as fuel price fluctuations and economic slowdown. On the other hand, the impact of most market headwinds on JetBlue could be comparatively less. For instance, it is not much affected by the Boeing (BA) crisis, due to non-exposure to the 737 Max jets. Having said that, Southwest has a clear advantage as far as its performance on the bourses is concerned. Analysts’ consensus rating on the company’s stock is moderate buy, with a target price of $23 that represents a 10% upside. In contrast, analysts overwhelmingly recommend holding JetBlue stock and predict muted growth. One of the key factors that make Southwest appealing to long-term investors is its initiatives aimed at easing cost pressure and ensuring stable revenue growth. After adding several new routes to its itinerary, Southwest currently flies to all the major US cities. Also, it keeps expanding the fleet, which includes some of the biggest aircraft. Southwest is poised to retain its leadership position in the segment, aided by the growing demand for air","Feb 18, 2020",https://news.alphastreet.com/southwest-airlines-is-a-better-investment-option-than-jetblue-airways-heres-why/

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Tanya Powley, Transport Correspondent Qatar Airways has raised its holdings in British Airways owner IAG to 25.1 per cent as the Middle Eastern carrier ramps up its strategy of investing in other airlines. The move to increase its stake from 21.4 per cent to just over a quarter comes just weeks after IAG, which also owns Spain’s Iberia and Ireland’s Aer Lingus, removed an almost year-long cap on non-EU investments. The Gulf carrier said the increase showed its “continued support of IAG and its strategy”, with chief executive Akbar Al Baker noting that its investment in the European airline group had been “highly successful” to date. Mr Al Baker has repeatedly said his strategy is to invest in profitable airlines — “goldsmiths”, as he calls them, rather than “scrap dealers”. The stake increase comes a month before Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, is due to step down from the company and be replaced by Iberia’s chief executive Luis Gallego. Qatar Airways has been busy in recent years buying shareholdings in other carriers to help boost traffic through its Doha hub, a strategy that has become more pressing after it was hit in 2017 by a blockade from Saudi, Emirati and Bahraini airspace following a political dispute. This month it announced it was in talks to buy a 49 per cent stake in Rwanda’s national carrier, RwandAir, just weeks after it agreed to buy a 60 per cent stake in Rwanda’s new Bugesera International Airport. Qatar Airways has acquired holdings in Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines and Chile-based Latam Airlines. Mr Al Baker has recently expressed interest in increasing its stake in Latam, as well as buying a stake in India’s IndiGo. The carrier also owns 49 per cent of Air Italy, which this month said it would be put into liquidation, with operations suspended from next Wednesday. Daniel Roeska, an aviation analyst at Bernstein, said the move by Qatar Airways to increase its stake in IAG was likely because it was a “good investment stock”. The European airline group’s shares have risen about 50 per cent over the past six months on the back of a lower fuel price, diminishing Brexit uncertainty and an improved outlook for capacity in 2020. Since February 2019 IAG has restricted non-EU shareholdings at 47.5 per cent as the carrier sought to ensure it remained compliant","Feb 19, 2020",https://www.ft.com/content/a1e024f8-5321-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f

But this little metric of negative sentiment, while popular among traders, can be valuable even to buy-and-hold investors who never want to place a single bearish bet. If you believe a stock will rise, you buy it. Easy. But what if you're bearish on a company's prospects and want to profit off that belief? A popular technique is short selling: To sell a stock short, you borrow shares so you can immediately turn around and sell them. You wait for shares to fall in price, then buy them back and return those shares to the lender. Your profit is the difference between the price you sold and the price you bought back. But that gamble can go wrong - to the delight of bullish investors. Short sellers incur losses when the stock's price goes higher. Also, time is against you when you short a stock, because you pay interest when you borrow shares. If you want to exit your short trade, you have to buy back shares, which in turn drives the stock price higher. That might force other short sellers to cut their losses, leading to a virtuous cycle of buying called a ""short squeeze."" That's why short interest (how many shares are currently sold short to bet against a company) matters. There's no concrete level, but anything above 10% of the float, which is the number of shares available for public trading, is worth watching. If you're a conservative, buy-and-hold investor who hates volatility, you might want to avoid stocks with high short interest. If you're an aggressive investor, however, you might consider buying these stocks in the hope that a small bit of positive news will trigger a short squeeze, netting large returns in a short time.

Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here. Qatar Airways increased its holding in British Airways parent IAG SA to more than a quarter of the stock, tightening its grip on the European group after expansion in the Gulf was thwarted by a Saudi-led embargo. The Doha-based airline lifted its stake in IAG, as International Consolidated Airlines Group SA is known, to 25.1% from 21.4% previously, it said in a statement Wednesday. The increased investment in the BA owner will give Qatar leverage at a time of transition as the London-based company’s own CEO, Willie Walsh, prepares to exit the post next month, and the carrier grapples with fallout from Britain exiting the European Union. Foreign entities are limited to 49% ownership of European airlines as a condition of their air operating licenses. “Our investment to date has been highly successful and the announced increase in our shareholding is evidence of our continued support of IAG and its strategy,” Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said. Voting rights of more than 25% in a U.K. company allow a shareholder to block special resolutions such as the adoption of new articles of association, or changing a company’s name, according to the website of law firm Stephens Scown.
