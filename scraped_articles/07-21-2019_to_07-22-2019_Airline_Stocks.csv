0,Delta says next big battle between airlines will be on the ground,Delta says the next big battle between airlines will take place on the ground. Wall Street is watching. The timing,"The airline industry is experiencing strong financial performance — Delta Air Lines recently hit a record stock price, and United Airline Holdings grew profits in its latest earnings as the U.S. economy continues its decade-long run. In fact, airline industry conditions are so good, longtime airline-stock hater Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway became one of the sector’s biggest investors in recent years after a wave of consolidation brought the fleets closer to the almost monopoly conditions he looks for in businesses. But other recent highs in air travel are not so positive: Airports all over the country are setting new records in monthly passenger levels, making the airport experience one of the worst “legs” in a traveler’s journey. As a result, major airlines flush with money for reinvestment are making the on-the-ground experience a greater focus of their efforts to out-compete rival carriers. “I think the next area of competition in air travel is in the airport,” Paul Jacobson, executive vice president and CFO of Delta said at the CNBC @Work Human Capital + Finance conference in Chicago last Tuesday. “How do you continue to streamline the on-the-ground experience. It is a big part of how passengers rate the experience.” In major metro areas the two biggest issues in airport satisfaction are access to the airport (with so many major airports far from city centers) and the terminal itself, at No. 1, according to J.D. Power. “The most common PR headline from any airport any month is ‘X airport sets new monthly passenger record,’” said Mike Taylor, J.D. Power’s travel practice leader. But that does not necessarily mean it is good PR with so many airports so dated. There are some aspects of the airport experience that airlines can’t do anything about. Only 6% more airports have been built in the U.S. since 1980, despite 181% more domestic passengers. “They can’t build another four-lane highway to the airport,” Taylor said. “Most of the airports are shoehorned into areas never meant to handle this much traffic.” Those problems don’t end once at the airport, either: Many parking lots closest to terminals at some of the busiest U.S. airports are now completely full and closed on multiple days per week. This is the type of on-the-ground frustration that leads to missed flights, and missed flights lead to the blame being placed all around. “People are more stressed on the airport and airlines","Jul 21, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/21/delta-says-next-big-battle-between-airlines-will-be-on-the-ground.html
1,3 Ways United Airlines Is Taking a Different Path | The Motley Fool,3 Ways United Airlines Is Taking a Different Path. The world's third-largest carrier has made an impressive comeback with some,"   Just a few years ago, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) seemed permanently destined to be the least profitable of the three big U.S. legacy carriers. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) was the clear industry leader, with pre-tax margins as much as 5 percentage points higher than United, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) took second place more often than not. However, United's management has pulled off an impressive turnaround over the past two years or so. The margin gap relative to Delta has started to shrink, and United has surpassed struggling rival American in profitability. The company didn't just copy Delta's strategy to achieve this comeback. Instead, it has gone its own way in the hunt for stronger profitability. Let's look at three ways that United is diverging from its peers on strategy. Fleet strategy is one area where the carrier is carving its own path. It has shown a growing interest in buying or leasing used jets to avoid the substantial expense of new aircraft. In 2015, the airline agreed to lease up to 25 used Airbus A319s from AerCap. Most of those planes will have arrived by the end of this summer. Last week, United announced that it had agreed to buy 19 used 737-700s between December 2019 and December 2021. Management also stated that the carrier would continue to make opportunistic acquisitions of used aircraft. UNITED AIRLINES IS REFRESHING ITS FLEET WITH A MIX OF NEW AND USED JETS. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. United is not exactly a pioneer with this strategy. Nearly a decade ago, Delta went on a used-aircraft acquisition spree. It bought dozens of out-of-favor MD-90s and leased 88 used Boeing 717s from Southwest Airlines. This allowed Delta to retire its oldest planes while conserving cash to pay down debt. Yet more recently, Delta has tilted the other way, perhaps because it now has a strong balance sheet. It hasn't added a used jet to its mainline fleet in years, whereas it plans to buy more than 200 brand-new mainline jets between 2019 and 2021. As for American, the largest U.S. airline has favored new jets pretty consistently. In fact, it has added nearly 600 new aircraft to its fleet since 2014 (including regional jets). Another way that United has diverged from its peers is in its comparatively low use of large regional jets. Dual-class regional jets, outfitted with between 65 and 79 seats (but most","Jul 22, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/07/22/3-ways-united-airlines-is-taking-a-different-path.aspx

USD/JPY.,"                                                   JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli settlers have established dozens of unauthorized settlement outposts in the West Bank in recent years, most of them founded since President Donald Trump entered office, an Israeli watchdog group said Monday. Peace Now said in a new report that Israeli settlers have founded 32 remote West Bank outposts since 2012, often with tacit government support. Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek these areas as parts of a future state. Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law and an impediment to a two-state solution to the conflict. According to Peace Now, most of the new outposts are farms that aim to take over large tracts of land at the expense of Palestinians and are often publicly funded. Other cases included the creation of educational institutions and tourist sites that receive funding from their respective government ministries. ""Most of the illegal construction is carried out in an organized manner by officials and with extensive funding from the public coffers,"" it said. Scores of settlement outposts dot the West Bank, in addition to over 120 established settlements. Over time, outposts often grow into neighborhoods of nearby settlements or into full-fledged settlements of their own. Trump's Mideast team is led by figures with close ties to the settler movement. His ambassador to Israel, for instance, recently told the New York Times that Israel has the ""right"" to annex some of the West Bank. Both critics and supporters of the settlements say the White House's friendly attitude has encouraged a jump in settlement activity. Peace Now said the government has retroactively authorized 15 outposts this year and seeks to approve 35 more as part of what it called a major expansion of West Bank settlements. ""Law enforcement authorities ignore the theft of the land and in effect abet this activity,"" Peace Now said. ""Settlers see this correctly as an incentive to build more outposts.""

6,Is American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Trading At A 25% Discount? - Simply Wall St News,Is American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Trading At A 25% Discount?. What's the estimated valuation?. 10-year free cash flow (FCF),"In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. I will be using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: (""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)= $14.4b The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 10-year government bond rate of 2.7%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 14.2%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF2029 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b × (1 + 2.7%) ÷ (14.2% – 2.7%) = US$20b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r)10 = $US$20b ÷ ( 1","Jul 22, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group/news/is-american-airlines-group-inc-nasdaqaal-trading-at-a-25-discount

Since its initial public offering (IPO) in November 2006 when the stock came on the market at $18.75 per share, the stock seemed to simply sink further and further until its lowest point in 2012, when shares hit rock bottom at around $0.80 per share. Since then, the stock has done nothing but increase further and further. Year to date, shares are up an incredible 71% to where it trades at writing at $44.29. This comes after a solid first-quarter report, where Air Canada went from reporting a net loss of $203 million in the first quarter of last year, to a net income of $345 million in the first quarter of this year. But while I like this stock now, it has definitely been quite the decade and a bit, and analysts aren’t 100% sure Air Canada can keep soaring upwards for the long term. Let’s look into whether Air Canada belongs in your long-term portfolio or if now is the time to sell at all-time highs. To understand where Air Canada could be another 13 years from now, we have to look at the Canadian airline industry as a whole. The airline industry could be in for a bit of a rude awakening in the near future. After years of increasing capacity at rates higher to GDP, the industry might face diminishing returns compared to what its invested. Return on investment could come in at 7.4% for 2019 for the airline industry according to one report, which would only just cover the cost of capital. That would mean only generating $0.7 billion of value for investors on $700 billion worth of investments. Then there are the trade wars and tariffs that keep popping up. This is a big problem for companies like Air Canada which still rely on cargo revenue, and could see those global prospects decline as well. Finally, there is also the rising cost of jet fuel, which could make up 25% of operating costs for airlines. This is a big problem for Air Canada at the moment, as the company’s fuel-efficient 737-MAXs have been grounded for the time being. So this all spells a lot of gloom and doom moving forward, and","Jul 22, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/07/22/13-years-after-its-ipo-where-will-air-canada-be-in-another-13-years/

In an interview, Lufthansa officials","German premium carrier Lufthansa is eyeing Hyderabad as a potential flight destination to add to its network while consolidating its current market. The airline also wants to operate flights to and from Pune, but can’t do so for now as the city doesn’t have an airport to service large aircraft. In an interview, Alexander Schlaubitz, Vice President, Marketing; and George Ettiyil, Senior Director, Sales, talk to Financial Express Online about why Lufthansa’s premium pricing is relevant for India, what Lufthansa expects from the rising competition from domestic carriers like IndiGo and SpiceJet and why Pune’s lack of airport costs not only domestic but also international carriers. An edited excerpt of Alexander Schlaubitz and George Ettiyil’s interview with Prachi Gupta. In a price-sensitive market like India, how does Lufthansa fare by being a brand on the premium end? Is it a sore point for customers who may not be willing to shell more money? Alexander Schlaubitz: India has an incredible traveller base and the base is becoming more diversified. The customers are very price-conscious but they are also very discerning. They know what they want from an airline and in those respects, we find the premium positioning to be quite relevant. But we also serve very competitive prices; these prices are very competitive in the marketplace.  George Ettiyil: A decade ago, I would have completely agreed with the view that Indian customers are price sensitive. Now, there is a growing section of travellers who have purchasing power and who are also willing to spend for the little extra that differentiates us from other very good brands. Indian consumers now have the purchasing power that compels them to pick a brand like Lufthansa. What kind of potential do you see in India market? Alexander Schlaubitz: From a global perspective, India is on a trajectory to become one of the top three travel markets, within a few years. There is an awful lot of velocity here and there is an increase in sophistication among traveller which is something that is very important to us. As travellers become more discerning, we position ourselves as a premium carrier in both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. This is a great market for us.

Example of,"Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) is a non-GAAP tool used to measure a company's financial performance. Although EBITDAR does not appear on a company's income statement, it can be calculated using information from the income statement.  \begin{aligned} &\text{EBITDAR}=\text{EBITDA + Restructuring/Rental Costs}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{EBITDA = Earnings before interest, taxes,}\\ &\text{depreciation, and amortization}\\ \end{aligned}
EBITDAR=EBITDA + Restructuring/Rental Costs
where:
EBITDA = Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization EBITDAR is a metric used primarily to analyze the financial health and performance of companies that have gone through restructuring within the past year. It is also useful for businesses such as restaurants or casinos that have unique rent costs. It exists alongside earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Using EBITDAR in analysis helps to reduce variability from one company's expenses to the next, in order to focus only on costs that are related to operations. This is helpful when comparing peer companies within the same industry. EBITDAR doesn't take rent or restructuring into account because this metric seeks to measure a company's core operational performance. For example, imagine an investor comparing two restaurants, one in New York City with expensive rent and the other in Omaha with significantly lower rent. To compare those two businesses effectively, the investor excludes their rent costs, as well as interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. Similarly, an investor may exclude restructuring costs when a company has gone through a restructuring and has incurred costs from the plan. These costs, which are included on the income statement, are usually seen as nonrecurring and are excluded from EBITDAR to give a better idea of the company's ongoing operations. EBITDAR is most often calculated for internal purposes only, as it is not a required financial reporting metric for public companies. A firm might calculate it each quarter to isolate and review operational expenses without having to consider fluctuating costs such as restructuring, or rent costs that may differ within various subsidiaries of the company or among the firm's competitors. The starting point is earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), also referred to as operating income. This metric excludes interest and taxes. The next step is to exclude costs associated with depreciation, amortization, rent or restructuring, to arrive at EBITDAR. For example, imagine the XYZ company earns $1 million in a year, and it has $400,000 in total operating","Jul 22, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitdar.asp

17,"Boeing’s 737 MAX Grounding Spills Over Into Economy, Weighs on GDP  - WSJ","The Wall Street Journal. Boeing’s 737 MAX Grounding Spills Over Into Economy, Weighs on GDP. Airlines, suppliers and trade data","The prolonged grounding of Boeing Co. ’s 737 MAX aircraft is rippling through the U.S. economy, hurting the nation’s trade balance and clouding the outlook for airlines, suppliers and their tens of thousands of workers. Companies ranging from American Airlines Group Inc., to engine maker General Electric Co. and smaller parts suppliers have cited the grounding and halt in deliveries of the jetliner for financial damage or the suspension of profit guidance. Several U.S. and foreign airlines are cutting back on routes and capacity growth or delaying pilot hiring and promotions because of the MAX. Boeing continues to make the MAX and other versions of the 737 at a rate of 42 a month, after cutting monthly output from 52 in April. Economists say the production cuts likely weighed on U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter, and warn the negative impact could intensify as long as the plane maker is unable to resume deliveries. Boeing is the largest U.S. manufacturing exporter and one of the nation’s top private employers. The MAX is its best-selling plane, and jets worth more than $30 billion sit idle since global regulators grounded the aircraft following a second fatal crash in March. The company hopes to resume deliveries in the fourth quarter, but some airlines and officials expect the MAX to stay out of service until next year. That would further dent U.S. exports and durable-goods orders at a time when some manufacturers are experiencing higher costs and lowering their output due to tariffs and trade tensions.
