0,Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Today. The three-day relief rally has faded.. What happened. So what. Now what. Should you,"   Airline stocks took a breather on Friday after three straight days of steady gains. The industry's outlook is much stronger now than it was a week ago thanks to the $2 trillion economic relief package making its way through Congress, but business conditions figure to be under pressure for some time to come. Shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) all opened down more than 10% before rebounding slightly as the day went on. Shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) are also down more than 5% on Friday. Airlines have been among the sectors hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, with travel demand all but disappearing overnight and revenue dropping by 80% or more. The companies have taken steps including cutting flights, grounding planes, and freezing hiring, but no amount of cuts can compensate for a lack of revenue coming through the door. Lawmakers have responded with up to $50 billion in loans and grants available to airlines in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (or CARES Act), which should go a long way toward helping these companies avoid flying into bankruptcy. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. But there is only so much that legislation can do, and the airlines still face an uncertain future. Until the pandemic is contained, it is hard to predict what the ultimate impact to their businesses will be. And if the U.S. falls into a recession, it could be multiple quarters before lucrative business travel rebounds. Airline investors have endured a bumpy ride in 2020. Shares of all of the stocks listed here are down between 30% and 60% for the year. But in the last week alone, Spirit had more than doubled heading into Friday trading, and much of the industry is up more than 40% for the week even with Friday's pullback.  AIRLINE FIVE-DAY PRICING AS OF 1:42 P.M. FRIDAY DATA BY YCHARTS. The airlines finish the week with a better financial outlook than at the start, but also facing a difficult environment in which to try to gain altitude. There is also likely to be continued volatility as the pandemic plays out. For investors able to block out the noise and focus on the long term, I believe it is a good time to be looking carefully at the","Mar 27, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/27/why-airline-stocks-are-falling-today.aspx
1,Buffett Would Think These 3 Stocks Are a Deal | The Motley Fool,Buffett Would Think These 3 Stocks Are a Deal. They're cheap today and could make for terrific long-term holds.. 1.,"   Warren Buffett is the most iconic and well-known value investor in the world. Many investors look to follow in his footsteps and make the same moves that he makes. His strategy centers on looking for value and investing for the very long term. And so when quality stocks are down and trading at low multiples to their earnings and book value, he'd likely agree that they're good deals investors should consider buying. Below are three stocks that would be good buys today based on Buffett's investing style.  Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) would be a good Buffett buy for multiple reasons. The diagnostics company performs testing and information services that help patients and doctors make informed decisions. It's a stable and necessary business. That's no more evident than on Quest's financials -- over the past 10 years, the company's top line has been between $7.1 billion and $7.8 billion. There hasn't been a whole lot of volatility. Quest's bottom line has been more variable, but the company's profit margin has been over 8% of sales for five straight years. Not only is Quest consistent, but it's a good value buy. The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 14 and two times its book value. Value investors like Buffett typically look for P/E to be 15 or below, while price-to-book multiples should normally be no more than 2. Quest ticks off those boxes as it has dipped 17% year to date, compared to the S&P 500 which has declined by 23%.  Although Buffett doesn't like to pay dividends, he likes investing in companies that do. And with a quarterly dividend of $0.56, investors can earn about 2.5% per year in dividend income by owning shares of Quest. This is more than investors can typically expect to earn from the average S&P 500 stock that yields 2%. Quest has also increased its dividend payments over the years, and they've increased by 47% from the $0.38 the company was paying investors five years ago. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is one of Buffett's holdings today, so it wouldn't be a stretch to say that he would think the big bank stock being down around 30% since the start of the year is a good deal. Bank stocks are another predictable type of investment that Buffett values. JPMorgan's revenue has been above $90 billion during each of the past","Mar 28, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/28/buffett-would-think-these-3-stocks-are-a-deal.aspx

3,Canadian Oil and Airline Stocks Are a Long-Term Buy for Contrarians - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Canadian Oil and Airline Stocks Are a Long-Term Buy for Contrarians. The,"      Victoria Hetherington | March 27, 2020 The thesis for buying beaten-up names is strong right now. Canadian oil and airline stocks have been especially savaged. These sectors are extremely cheap, even with the two-day rally factored in. Some great names are on sale, from Air Canada to Suncor. These are top drawer, blue-chips that belong on every Canadian investor’s watch-list. Some Canadian oil stocks have been crushed by the coronavirus crash. Look at Vermilion Energy, which has lost 84% in the past four weeks. That’s pushed its trailing annual dividend yield to 89%. But one of the reasons why Vermilion has crashed so hard is that the company slashed its dividend. Pundits have long urged caution about this name’s reliability for passive income. Vermilion is bearish on mid-term, however, per a statement of March 16. “While we continue to believe the long-term fundamentals for the oil and gas industry are sound and will lead to higher prices in the future, we cannot predict how long the impact from COVID-19 and the OPEC+ price war will continue.” Oil bulls may want to apply this logic to other names in the hydrocarbon sector. Air Canada is among the best damaged TSX oil and airline stocks. It’s long been a favourite of analysts and investors alike. The nation’s flag-carrying name doesn’t fit a dividend investing thesis. However, the stock bounced 30% this week, bringing it 74% up from its 52-week low. The momentum here is astounding. A COVID-19 vaccine rally could substantially reward Air Canada investors who buy on weakness. The Motley Fool recommends four key tips for investing during a bear market. In essence they are: Buy “forever” stocks, or at least stocks you can hold for many years. Don’t try to time the market during such periods of high uncertainty and dangerous volatility, though. Get invested in dividend stocks that support a multi-year passive income strategy and supplement your stock portfolio with the best-rated bonds. Investors should also be prepared for dividends to be reduced. Would you still hold certain income stocks if they didn’t pay dividends for a while? Buy into weakness in stages. The best Canadian stocks may be recession-resistant long term, but buy slowly. Look at the way Suncor rallied this week. Its share price shot up by an incredible 26%, which tells would-be investors sitting on the hydrocarbons fence one key","Mar 27, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/03/27/canadian-oil-and-airline-stocks-are-a-long-term-buy-for-contrarians/
4,Stock Watch: Airlines,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"   Published 27 March 2020 Fidelity Personal Investing  Important information: The value of investments and the income from them, can go down as well as up, so you may get back less than you invest. With the world in lockdown, the airline industry has already proven to be one of the first casualties. Domestic and international travel has been banned by numerous countries, in a bid to halt the spread of the Coronavirus, leaving skies empty and turning airports into giant parking lots filled with planes with nowhere else to go. It is an unprecedented situation and like everything to do with the pandemic, is one which is forcing changes the like of which we have never seen before. Just like the virus too, the crisis in the airline industry is turning out to be indiscriminate - affecting budget carriers as well as national airlines. The International Air Transport Association has been blunt, warning that without state aid, Europe’s airlines could go bust by May, as it forecasts that the industry could lose a quarter of a trillion dollars in revenue this year. These are difficult times and let’s not forget that the airline industry had already been struggling, before the coronavirus took hold. Like the retail sector, airlines have been bearing the brunt of the economic slowdown and shift in consumer spending for a while now. A little over a year ago Flybmi made headlines when it ceased trading, blaming an increase in fuel and carbon costs, along with Brexit uncertainty. A month later it was Wow Air, the Icelandic ultra-low-cost carrier that disrupted the transatlantic market by offering flights between North America and Europe for as little as £99, that was also permanently grounded. In September of last year Thomas Cook shook the entire travel industry when the 178-year-old British travel company and airline collapsed after failing to secure £200 million in emergency funding following a demand from its lenders. About 600,000 holidaymakers were left stranded, leading to the largest peacetime repatriation effort - at that time - in British history. A spate of other collapses saw off airlines across the globe. Bankruptcies, in many cases caused by flawed business models, fierce competition, bad management, and unexpected costs caused those with weaknesses to fail. Long-running Brexit worries were partly to blame, fuel costs and the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max jets also caused notable","Mar 27, 2020",https://www.fidelity.co.uk/markets-insights/stock-watch/stock-watch-airlines/
5,The Easy Gains May Be Over for American Airlines (AAL) Stock | InvestorPlace,The Easy Gains May Be Over for American Airlines Stock. American Airlines was already struggling financially before the coronavirus hit.," After a stunning fall to $10, shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) have since been on a tear. Note that AAL stock is now at $15. Yet despite this rally, the company still sports a miserable year-to-date loss of 50%.  The volatility is certainly understandable as it is extremely difficult to gauge the future of American Airlines. The big issue, of course, is how long the depressed levels of travel will last. The coronavirus from China is a global menace. So just in terms of foreign travel, it could easily be several months or more with little revenue generation for AAL. Another issue is that the coronavirus may be seasonal. On Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: “I know we’ll be successful in putting this down now, but we really need to be prepared for another cycle.” And while there are hints of progress on a coronavirus vaccine — such as from companies like AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) — the general availability of any treatment will likely take more than a year because of the clinical trials. In other words, this year could easily see consistently depressed travel volumes. What’s more, there will likely be much consumer resistance to resume flying. A recent survey from The Harris Poll shows that 1 in 5 would wait at least four months after the curve on the coronavirus flattens before getting on a plane again. Among the major airline operators, American Airlines is one of the weaker firms. Note that the company went bankrupt in 2011. And as for the past three years, it has seen negative free cash flows despite a robust global economy and secular growth trends in the industry. The balance sheet is also far from inspiring. While there is $3.8 billion in cash and short-term securities — as of the end of 2019 — the debt load is enormous. Consider that short and long-term liabilities are over $24 billion. By comparison, the market capitalization for AAL stock is only $6.2 billion. Granted, it seems remote that the company will go bust. First of all, Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) Warren Buffett has a 10% stake. It seems reasonable that he would want to find ways to provide assistance. After all, this is what he did during the financial crisis with companies like Bank","Mar 27, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/03/easy-gains-over-american-airlines-aal-stock/
6,Sell the Bailout Rally in United Airlines (UAL) Stock | InvestorPlace,Sell the Bailout Rally in United Airlines Stock. The bailout won't fix the airline industry's problems — or the economy," It’s been an insane month for airlines stocks. Legacy carrier United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) has been no exception. UAL stock traded for $90 as recently as January. Last week, it sold for a low of just $18, amounting to an 80% loss of value in scarcely two months. However, United’s fortunes are back on the upswing. The Senate recently approved an emergency economic relief package by unanimous vote. The House of Representatives should vote on the bill in coming days as well. This aid package will provide tens of billions of dollars to the airline industry in the form of cash grants and loans. Traders have rushed to buy back into the airlines. United Airlines stock, for example, has doubled from its low point over the past week, though admittedly the current $33 price is far short of the previous $90 peak. That said, sometimes when a stock price doubles in a few days, you should take advantage of it and get out while the getting is good. This is one of those cases. While the bailout money will certainly help the airline industry, it’s not a cure-all. We’re still in the early innings of this economic slowdown, and heavily exposed companies like airlines have plenty more turbulence ahead. The stimulus package that made it through the Senate is set to give the airlines roughly $50 billion in aid. Bulls have taken that headline number and run with it, bidding up airline , including UAL stock, sharply. But let’s slow down for a second. The actual language around the bailout is not fully hammered out and leaves a lot of leeway. Yes, the $50 billion figure seems set. But it’s not clear how much of this will be cash grants, and how much will be loans. It also appears to give Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin a lot of authority to set the rules on what happens with the $50 billion. Airlines will have to cap executive pay for two years. And perhaps more importantly for shareholders, all airlines will have to suspend dividends and buybacks for at least a year. In case the government aid isn’t big enough, or doesn’t arrive soon enough, United has also taken other measures to shore up its finances. On Thursday, for example, it announced that it had secured a $500 million term loan from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). United will have to pay back the","Mar 27, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/03/united-airlines-ual-stock-sell-the-bailout-rally/

""I've been very clear this is not an airline bailout,"" Mnuchin told Fox Business Network Friday. ""It is support to the airlines for national security reasons that the taxpayers are going to be compensated for."" U.S. airlines are preparing to tap the government to cover payroll in a sharp travel downturn triggered by the coronavirus, even after the government warned it may take stakes in exchange for bailout funds or other financial instruments, people familiar with the matter said.

Trusted & Regulated Stock & CFD Brokers. << Previous.","Author: Siraj Sarwar Last Updated: March 27, 2020 United Airlines (NYSE: UAL) stock is among the biggest losers as the coronavirus outbreak continues to sap demand for travel across the Asia Pacific and other parts of the world. The company has been cutting both domestic and international flights from its schedule over the past month; the United Airlines recently announced plans to cut international flights by 20% and domestic flights by 10% in March. The negative impact is not limited to United Airlines. The stock prices of travel and airline companies have been already in a downswing due to tourism restrictions in China and Europe. The cancellation of corporate conferences and business events are adding to the bearish trend. Airlines could lose around $63B to $113B in passenger revenue this year, according to the International Air Transport Association.  United Airlines stock plunged by 30 per cent in the last month alone, extending the three months price decline to 42 per cent. United Airlines recently announced they are withdrawing fiscal 2020 guidance, blaming heightened uncertainty due to the coronavirus outbreak. The company says they don’t know about the duration of coronavirus and its impact on overall demand. The company expects to generate earnings in the range of $11-$13 a share if the virus impact reduces by mid-May and normal travel patterns start for Pacific routes. Despite headwinds, the United Airlines 8-K form indicates a sustainable growth forecast for the following years. United Airlines is exposed to coronavirus spread as it generates 40 per cent of revenue from international flights compared to 30 per cent for Delta (NYSE: DAL) and 3 per cent for Southwest (NYSE: LUV). Cowen analyst Helane Becker suggested investors stay away from airline stocks in the short-term. “Our near term concern is that airlines start canceling flights on the North Atlantic and in the US domestic market. We believe those would be extreme measures, but we also note that a number of companies are limiting corporate travel. That is worrisome, as the large international airlines are dependent on corporate travel,” notes analyst Helane Becker.

SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER!.,"The $2 trillion stimulus package helped airline stocks to rally as the bill incorporated funding to help shore up the airline industry, which took a hit after travel restrictions were imposed by countries in order to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. This will certainly help exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with exposure to airlines like Boeing and Delta Air Lines. Per a Barron’s article, the bill “provides $33 billion in grants for airlines to make payrolls, including $25 billion for passenger carriers, $4 billion for cargo operators such as FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS), and $3 billion for contractors. The bill also makes $29 billion in loans available, providing a liquidity backstop if private capital markets freeze up. And it includes waivers on fuel and excise taxes through 2020.” ”The existence of the program itself is very bullish cause it allows lenders to think about the industry surviving,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon told Barron’s. With the coronavirus outbreak, the number of travelers taking to the skies certainly saw a marked decrease, but the latest stimulus package should help the US Global Jets ETF (NYSEArca: JETS) take-off.

The recommendation could just as easily be “don’t let your daughter buy airport shares”, because while they have always been regarded highly for their longevity and staying power, 2020 – a year everyone wants to forget even while it is only three months old, thanks to Sars-CoV-2 (as it is technically known: the medical syndrome COVID-19 is to the Sars-CoV-2 virus what Aids is to HIV) – is a completely different ball game from anything that has gone before, with airport equity in free fall. The struggle is pretty tough here too, but the skies are anything but overcrowded. There are, though, some glimpses of light at the end of the tunnel.

Last modified on Wed 1 Jul 2020 UK-listed shares ended a recent run of gains and fell heavily on Friday, with housebuilders and airlines among the worst affected as the fallout from the coronavirus lockdown continued to spread through corporate Britain. The FTSE 100 fell by 5.25% on Friday after rising for three consecutive days - although that still left it 308 points, or 5.93%, higher than the start of a week of volatile trading. The FTSE 250 tracking mid-cap companies lost 3.97% on Friday. The property industry was left reeling on Friday after the government put the brakes on the housing market on Thursday night, urging buyers and sellers to put plans on hold until the coronavirus restrictions were no longer in place. The move prompted a sell-off of shares in some of the UK’s largest housebuilding firms. Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, down by 5.3% and 9% respectively, while Persimmon lost 11%. The property website Rightmove lost 6%. Redrow shares fell 8.6% after the housebuilder issued a Covid-19 update to investors. The company said it had stopped building new homes, was putting a significant number of employees on temporary leave and was in talks with banks to shore up its finances as the coronavirus hammers the construction industry. A slew of companies warned of negative effects from the virus response. They included: Gatwick airport, which said it would shut one of its two terminals following a collapse in passenger numbers. Rolls-Royce, the aircraft engine manufacturer, said it planned to significantly reduce all non-essential activity at its civil aerospace sites in Britain from midnight. Cairn Energy, a North Sea oil producer, said it had that cut spending plans. More than 4,000 oil rig contractors in the North Sea have already lost their jobs, according to the lobby group Oil & Gas UK. Finsbury Food Group stopped production at its Manchester factory with the market for food services at pubs, restaurants and schools all but disappearing. The crisis has forced large parts of the economy to shut down as people are advised to work from home where possible, and anyone with symptoms of Covid-19 being required to self-isolate. The prospect of the disease spreading could also imperil the","Mar 27, 2020",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/uk-stocks-fall-with-airlines-and-housebuilders-among-worst-hit-coronavirus

18,"Should You Buy Airline, Hotel, or Cruise Stocks? - Investing to Thrive®","Should You Buy Airline, Hotel, or Cruise Stocks?. My Take on Travel Stocks. The One Catch About Buying Low. Businesses","Posted by Julie Rains  |  Investing Disclosure: This article contains affiliate links, which generate income for this free website at no cost to you. This article is written for entertainment purposes only and should not be construed as financial or any other type of professional advice. I’ve been participating in an investing Facebook group hosted by my colleague Joseph Hogue, CFA, of My Stock Market Basics. There, I’ve witnessed patience in long-term investing and reasonable cautiousness as well as excitement surrounding the opportunity to “buy low.” The topic of purchasing airline and cruise stocks has arisen more than once. My initial reaction: whaaaat??? Then I saw a tweet from Roger Whitney, CFP. He reports that after calming his clients down and convincing them not to sell stock in this down market, they then ask if they should buy stock in airlines. Others in the financial planning and advisory space tweet that they’ve had similar conversations. The collective reaction seems to be: whaaaat??? I’m not a financial advisor and not qualified to render personalized advice. Take what I say with a grain of salt. To the question “should I buy cruise lines on sale?” (or other similar types of travel-related stocks), “no” is my answer. All that said, I still own Disney (DIS), which operates in the travel industry and runs cruises. It could be a good buy though I’m focusing on other financial and non-financial actions now, like finishing my tax returns, contributing to a Roth 401k, and shopping for groceries online. (Here I’ll insert that doing nothing with an investment portfolio is a valid response to market unrest.) Still, after some consideration, I can see that posing the question about cruise lines is a reasonable one, especially given the emphasis on buying low. We’ve heard that the secret to investing is to “buy low and sell high.” That’s still holds true. We can now buy low, or at least what seems low compared to a few weeks or months ago. The other part of the equation, “sell high,” is the problem. The current situation prompts me to add a piece of information that’s missing from my earlier writings. I’ve cautioned to avoid paying too much for a share of a company’s stock. I’ve written about using a discounted cash flow (DCF) to estimate an appropriate price per share. That advice is still solid. Right now seems to","Mar 27, 2020",https://investingtothrive.com/should-you-buy-airline-hotel-or-cruise-stocks/
