Virus developments watched. Currencies and oil.,"Stocks in South Korea led losses among major Asian markets on Monday after the country raised its coronavirus alert to the “highest level” following a rapid spike in cases over the weekend. The Kospi was down 3.87% to close at 2,079.04 as shares of automaker Hyundai Motor plunged 4.3% while the Kosdaq fell 4.3% to end its trading day at 639.29. The Korean won weakened to 1,219.22 per dollar following levels below 1200 seen last week. South Korea’s Korean Air Lines and Asiana Airlines also dropped 6.16% and 6.09%, respectively. Reuters reported Monday that both the South Korean airlines had announced they are suspending flights to Daegu — the country’s fourth-largest city with the largest number of coronavirus cases — for the time being. Airline stocks in the rest of the region also fell amid the contagion fears. Australia’s Qantas Airways plummeted 7.53%,  while Hong Kong-listed shares of China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines fell 2.73% and 3.74%, respectively, in afternoon trade. On Monday morning, the Korea Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention reported that seven people have died from COVID-19. The number of cases has risen to 161 new cases, bringing the total to 763 nationwide — the country with the most cases outside the mainland.′ Eurasia Group’s Scott Seaman told CNBC on Monday that now may be a “good opportunity” for South Korea’s government to increase fiscal expenditure. “What we’ve seen is the Moon government in South Korea really get geared up for a big response several weeks ago, in fact, the government was already talking about really pulling out all the stops to make sure that it could contain the economic and the health impact of this,” Seaman, who is Asia director at Eurasia Group, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “Now that we’re seeing this huge spike in cases and we’re getting closer to National Assembly elections on April 15th the government has an even greater incentive now to try to pump more money into the economy or otherwise … support the economy going forward,” he said. However, he said the overall effect of such a move would be unknown given that the “problem” has expanded beyond South Korea and China, where the outbreak was first reported.

CNBC Newsletters","Stocks fell sharply on Monday as the number of coronavirus cases outside China surged, stoking fears of a prolonged global economic slowdown from the virus spreading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1,031.61 points lower, or 3.56%, at 27,960.80. The S&P 500 slid 3.35% to 3,225.89 while the Nasdaq Composite closed 3.71% lower at 9,221.28. It was the Dow’s biggest point and percentage-point drop since February 2018. The Dow also gave up its gain for 2020 and is now down 2% for the year. The S&P 500 also had its worst day in two years and wiped out its year-to-date gain as well. “The second-largest economy in the world is completely shut down. People aren’t totally pricing that in,” said Larry Benedict, CEO of The Opportunistic Trader, adding a 10% to 15% correction in stocks may be starting. He also said some parts of the market, particularly large-cap tech stocks, appear to be over-owned. “It seems like there’s much more to come.” Coronavirus-impacted names led the way lower.

AMD dipped 7.8%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) was down by 4.5%. “The market had been sanguine about the spread of the coronavirus,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “That sanguine stance is being tested today.” “Companies are assessing their suppliers and their supply chains and seeing whether or not their revenue is going to slow,” Krosby said. “Because of that, this has become a sell-first, ask-questions later type of market.” Apple and its suppliers took a hit as well. Shares of the iPhone maker were down by 4.8%. Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo dropped more than 1.8% each. Overseas markets fell sharply. The European Stoxx 600 dropped more than 3% while Korea’s Kospi index slid 3.9%.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 1.8%.

President and Chief Executive Officer, Zain Tulsie Issurdutt, who is of Guyanese parentage, has returned to Guyana accompanied by his father and Chairman, Tulsie Ram Issurdutt to set up the firm. Tulsie Ram Issurdutt was born at Leonora on the West Coast of Demerara. The Issurdutts are no strangers to the airline business. In the 1990s, they created their own airline, TriStar Airlines, which was based in Las Vegas, Nevada.The carrier operated under an exclusive marketing agreement with Japan Airlines. For the TriStar venture, Tulsie Ram Issurdutt holds the distinction of being one of only three foreign nationals to create and certify a Part 121 scheduled commercial airline in the United States,the other two being JetBlue Airlines’ Brazilian- born David Neeleman and Virgin Atlantic’s British-born Sir Richard Branson.

9,2 Biotech Stocks Poised for Jaw-Dropping Gains | The Motley Fool,2 Biotech Stocks Poised for Jaw-Dropping Gains. These relative newcomers to the landscape of publicly-traded biotech stocks could be big,"   Biotech companies early in the process of drug development have proved to be an extremely fruitful area for investors on the hunt for life-changing growth opportunities. In fact, the 10 best-performing stocks every year for the past decade have consisted largely of clinical-stage biotechs.   Which developmental biotechs should aggressive investors have on their radar screens? Atreca (NASDAQ:BCEL) and Crinetics Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CRNX) are two names with explosive growth potential in the years ahead. Here's a brief overview on each company. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Since going public in June 2019, Atreca's shares have risen by a healthy 24.2%. Although this name hasn't caught on among most retail investors yet, Wall Street's elite have been slowly gobbling up big chunks of this drugmaker ever since its debut as a public company. Two of Atreca's biggest shareholders, in fact, are Baker Bros. Advisors and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. That's an unusually strong set of top-shelf investors for a company with a novel and completely unproven immunotherapy platform. What's attracting some of Wall Street's best investors to this name? Atreca's main selling point is its unique take on immunotherapy. The company's approach centers on developing therapies based on the immune responses of cancer patients. By doing so, Atreca has been able to develop a sizable library of potentially therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, many of which might be able to be used against a wide swath of solid tumors.  Where do things stand now? Atreca recently entered the clinic with its lead antibody, known as ATRC-101. The company is conducting a dose-escalating basket study (a number of different solid tumor types) to assess its efficacy and safety in various ways. The big investing takeaway is that this early-stage data could attract multiple partnering deals, or perhaps a buyout offer. Immunotherapy companies with novel mechanisms of action are a highly sought-after commodity in biopharma these days. Atreca, in turn, appears poised for a huge jump with the help of a major partner, if its well-differentiated immunotherapy platform is validated in human subjects. Rare-disease stocks have a strong track when it comes to producing enormous returns on capital. The market adores these types of companies because their products tend to have longer than normal shelf lives, less blowback over premium pricing structures, and generally less competition. As such, it's not uncommon for rare-disease stocks to trade at 10 to 15","Feb 23, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/23/3-biotech-stocks-poised-for-jaw-dropping-gains.aspx
