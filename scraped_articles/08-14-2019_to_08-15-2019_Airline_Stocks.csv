American Airlines stock has tumbled over the past 20 months because the outlook and optics surrounding the company have been consistently negative.

Over the past 20 months, American Airlines has dealt with rising oil prices (which killed its margins in early 2018), slowing demand (which caused its revenue growth to decelerate in late 2018), and the grounding of the 737s (which pushed down its volumes and added cost pressure). Given that backdrop, it’s no wonder AAL stock has dropped over 50% since early 2018. Over the next year, the outlook and optics of American Airlines will change for the better.

As the bond rate inversion curve appeared on 14-Aug-2019 in the US and the UK, Wall Street headed rapidly south. A number of other countries have already this experienced inversion for a while. And in Germany, the world’s fourth largest economy, GDP growth rate went into reverse in 2Q2019. Does this mean recession is coming, or even imminent? Air freight numbers have been steadily falling for nearly a year. They used to be good forward indicators of where the world economy is headed, but not so much in recent years. Passenger traffic growth too has slowed markedly in the past year. Global trade conflict is creating uncertainty and aviation is inevitably caught up in that. So are we heading for trouble, and if so, when? Summary Especially for airlines in Asia Pacific, freight contributes considerably to overall revenues. And, since late-2018, the freight downturn has hit almost all regions, as this IATA chart shows.

3,Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific stock moves after recent tumble,"Shares of Cathay Pacific rebound, but the airline may still be in a 'very tough place'. Cathay in the spotlight","Shares of Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific rebounded on Wednesday. Still, “much uncertainty” remains ahead in the market, according to Luya You, analyst for transportation research at Bocom International. “We believe ... the most prudent way to treat the stock right now is to downgrade to neutral,” You — who disclosed ownership in Cathay Pacific stock — told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday. “It’s very, very hard for us to know what’s going to happen in the next upcoming days or even upcoming weeks simply because right now Cathay Pacific is unfortunately stuck in a very, very, very tough place.” Shares of Cathay Pacific jumped 2.83% on Wednesday. You’s comments came as Hong Kong continues to be rocked by protests that have lasted for weeks and have seen outbursts of violence. Recent rounds have left operations at the city’s airport disrupted for two days. For its part, Cathay Pacific has come under increased scrutiny from Beijing, with the Chinese aviation regulatory body issuing a “major aviation safety risk warning” to the airline last week. The Civil Aviation Authority said that “on multiple occasions,” Cathay’s flight personnel have participated in “violent assault,” according to CNBC’s translation. “The incidents pose a serious threat to aviation safety, causing adverse social impact and as a result is increasing inbound aviation safety threats from Hong Kong to the mainland,” it said. It also ordered the carrier to provide identification information for its crew on mainland-bound flights, and said that crew members that do not receive the authority’s approval won’t be allowed into its airspace, including on flights bound for other destinations. Asked if other airlines could benefit from the misfortunes of Cathay Pacific, You said it was possible but “it’s a little bit too early” at the moment, as the Chinese aviation authority was “still waiting” to see the carrier’s response. “If things do significantly ... deteriorate then potentially yes, you know, the other airlines such as Air China, China Southern, even foreign airlines at Hong Kong International Airport could benefit from any displaced demand that goes from Cathay to anywhere else,” she said. Looking ahead, You said it was “very hard to say” how Cathay Pacific was likely to respond further to the current situation. “Everybody’s waiting to see their official response,” You said. “They’ve already issued their verbal response, their verbal agreement to China’s new standards but we’ve yet to see really a","Aug 14, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/14/hong-kong-airline-cathay-pacific-stock-moves-after-recent-tumble.html
4,The Importance Of Diversification,The Importance Of Diversification. . What Is Diversification in Investing?. KEY TAKEAWAYS. Understanding Diversification in Investing. . How Many Stocks,"Diversification is a technique that reduces risk by allocating investments across various financial instruments, industries, and other categories. It aims to maximize returns by investing in different areas that would each react differently to the same event. Most investment professionals agree that, although it does not guarantee against loss, diversification is the most important component of reaching long-range financial goals while minimizing risk. Here, we look at why this is true and how to accomplish diversification in your portfolio. Let's say you have a portfolio that only has airline stocks. Share prices will drop following any bad news, such as an indefinite pilot strike that will ultimately cancel flights. This means your portfolio will experience a noticeable drop in value. You can counterbalance these stocks with a few railway stocks, so only part of your portfolio will be affected. In fact, there is a very good chance that these stock prices will rise, as passengers look for alternative modes of transportation. You could diversify even further because of the risks associated with these companies. That's because anything that affects travel will hurt both industries. Statisticians may say that rail and air stocks have a strong correlation. This means you should diversify across the board—different industries as well as different types of companies. The more uncorrelated your stocks are, the better. By diversifying, you're making sure you don't put all your eggs in one basket. Be sure to diversify among different asset classes, too. Different assets such as bonds and stocks don't react the same way to adverse events. A combination of asset classes like stocks and bonds will reduce your portfolio's sensitivity to market swings because they move in opposite directions. So if you diversify, unpleasant movements in one will be offset by positive results in another. And don't forget location, location, location. Look for opportunities beyond your own geographical borders. After all, volatility in the United States may not affect stocks and bonds in Europe, so investing in that part of the world may minimize and offset the risks of investing at home. Obviously, owning five stocks is better than owning one, But there comes a point when adding more stocks to your portfolio ceases to make a difference. There is a debate over how many stocks are needed to reduce risk while maintaining a high return. The most conventional view argues that an investor can achieve optimal diversification","Aug 15, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/investing/importance-diversification/

Forex Resources,"LATAM Airlines Group SA (NYSE: LTM) stock rose over 2.2% in the pre-market session of August 14th, 2019 (as of 5:29 pm GMT-4; Source: Google finance) as the company in the second quarter of FY 19 has reported the reduction in the net loss of the company to US$62.8 million, as compared to the US$207.8 million loss in the same period of 2018, on the back of an improvement of US$201.8 million in the foreign exchange result in second quarter 2019 compared with 2018. The company has reported 0.5% in the total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 to US$2,370.0 million, against US$2,357.4 million in the second quarter of 2018. This increase is on the back of a 3.2% increase in passenger revenues, offset by a 10.2% decrease in cargo revenues and 19.9% decrease in other revenues. Passenger and cargo revenues accounted for 85.2% and 11.4% of the total operating revenue of the quarter, respectively.  Further, during the second quarter 2019, LATAM Airlines Group carried 1.4 million passengers more than the same period last year and over the past 12 months has transported more than 71 million passengers for the first time since the association between LAN and TAM. This growth has been especially strong in LATAM’s domestic markets, both in Brazil and in Spanish-speaking countries, which accounted for 1.3 million of the additional passengers in the quarter. Moreover, by the end of the quarter, LATAM´s financial debt amounted to US$7.7 billion, a 1.2% increase compared to the previous quarter, while leverage reached 4.5x from 4.3x in March 2019. For the balance of 2019, the Company has roughly US$591 million in debt maturities. At the end of the second quarter 2019, LATAM has reported US$1,381 million in cash and cash equivalents, including certain highly liquid investments accounted as other current financial assets. Furthermore, the Company´s liquidity position was enhanced by US$600 million of an undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF) line. Thus, LATAM’s liquidity position amounted to 19.5% of the last twelve months’ net revenue by June 30, 2019. Additionally, Fleet commitments for 2019 amount to US$1,197 million, with approximately US$676 million accounting for capital expenditures. To date, LATAM has successfully financed all of its 2019 deliveries with a combination of sales & leasebacks and JOLCO financing, comprising senior secured debt and Japanese equity. For 2020, expected fleet commitments amount to US$708 million. For FY 19, the company expects","Aug 14, 2019",https://fxdailyreport.com/hot-airline-stock-to-watch-latam-airlines-group-sa-nyse-ltm/

This is the FTSE,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Rupert Hargreaves | Thursday, 15th August, 2019 | More on: IAG Right now, the median historical P/E ratio of stocks in the FTSE 100 is 13.4. With City analysts forecasting average earnings growth of around 8.5% for the index’s constituents this year, the ratio is set to fall to 12.8 for 2020.  This is only the median valuation of stocks in the UK’s leading blue-chip index. Some businesses are worth substantially more or less. And one company that is worth considerably less is International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE: IAG).  5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Owner of the British Airways and Iberia brands, IAG is one of the world’s largest airline groups. Over the past 10 years, under the management of CEO Willie Walsh, IAG has been transformed from a money-losing basket case into a tremendously profitable airline business. Last year the company earned nearly €3bn, although this was mainly due to one-off factors. But City analysts are expecting a healthy €2.3bn of net profit for 2019. Based on these figures, IAG’s return on equity — a measure of business profitability — was 32% last year, which puts the company in the top 10% of the most profitable public businesses on the London market.  However, despite these attractive profitability metrics, shares in IAG have the lowest valuation in the FTSE 100. At the time of writing, shares in the company are trading at a forward P/E of just 4.2, that’s a discount of 67% to the market average.  Generally speaking, companies with a higher level of profitability than the rest of the market deserve a premium valuation, but that’s clearly not the case with IAG. The question is why, and if it is worth taking advantage of this valuation anomaly? The airline business is quite an unpredictable one. There are so many different factors that can alter earnings. It is quite difficult to predict growth. Analysts have to take into account factors such as","Aug 15, 2019",https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2019/08/15/this-is-the-ftse-100s-cheapest-stock-is-it-worth-buying/

By CCN.com: The stock market is at its third most expensive valuation in history. The market’s overall valuation, as measured by the S&P 500, is approximately twice that of the long-term average. Between that, and the inverted yield curve signaling a possible recession, investors sold off the market in a big way on Wednesday. This could signal the beginning of a stock market crash that could take the indices down by 50 percent or more.   Fortunately, investors have a few critical signals that may indicate when the big drop is about to begin. While they aren’t foolproof, they provide a windsock that can allow investors to set up short positions to hedge their portfolio. When we look at daily and weekly charts of any stock or index, we can overlay two important lines that show critical levels of price support or resistance.

14,Alaska Airlines Isn't Worried About the Boeing 737 MAX | The Motley Fool,"Alaska Airlines Isn't Worried About the Boeing 737 MAX. Alaska Airlines hasn't yet received its first Boeing 737 MAX, but","   Airlines that were near the beginning of the line to receive Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets have been feeling a lot of pain this year. The troubled model has been grounded worldwide since mid-March, forcing 737 MAX operators to cancel dozens or even hundreds of flights a day. And while Boeing hopes to get its most important product back in the sky within the next few months, there's still no clear timeline for a return to service. Nevertheless, management at Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) isn't worried about any ill effects from the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. In fact, there's growing evidence that the company could be planning to double down on the 737 MAX once the grounding is lifted. As recently as mid-2016, Alaska Airlines planned to add the 737 MAX to its fleet beginning in late 2017. However, due to a desire to minimize complexity as it worked to integrate Virgin America, a smaller rival it acquired in late 2016, Alaska later deferred its first 737 MAX delivery to 2018 -- and then to 2019. These deferrals had nothing to do with safety concerns. Yet the fortuitous result was that Alaska Airlines didn't have a single Boeing 737 MAX in its fleet when regulators grounded the type back in March. Thus, it hasn't had to cancel flights because of the grounding. ALASKA AIRLINES HASN'T ADDED ANY MAX MODELS TO ITS BOEING 737 FLEET YET. IMAGE SOURCE: ALASKA AIRLINES. Alaska Airlines was scheduled to receive three 737 MAX 9s in the second half of 2019. Based on current conditions, it expects to receive just one this year, with the others arriving in early 2020. These delivery delays won't impact its operations, though, given that Alaska has nearly 240 planes in its mainline fleet. The carrier has received several new 737-900ERs and A321neos this year, which have been sufficient to support its modest 2019 growth plans. While the timeline for recertifying the 737 MAX has shifted several times, Alaska Airlines isn't hedging against further delays. (Some media outlets have tied the airline's decision to put some older Q400 turboprops back into service to the 737 MAX grounding, but that was a separate decision related to Alaska's need to defend its home turf in the Pacific Northwest.) For example, during the company's earnings call last month, CFO Brandon Pedersen said that Alaska would go ahead with plans to return three","Aug 14, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/14/alaska-airlines-isnt-worried-about-the-boeing-737.aspx

Vistara | Vistara Airlines | private airlines Aneesh Phadnis & Dev Chatterjee  |  Mumbai 
Last Updated at August 15, 2019 00:02 IST  The Tata-Singapore Airlines joint venture Vistara’s losses nearly doubled to Rs 831 crore in 2018-19 (FY19) in a tough operating environment, which also saw its peers post weak results. The airline, however, is expected to improve its financial performance in the current financial year, as it expands its network and gets a boost in premium-class occupancy following the closure of Jet Airways. Vistara had reported a loss of Rs 431 crore in the previous financial year. The airline’s latest loss figure is mentioned in Tata Sons’ annual report for 2018-19. The report does not give the details of revenue and break-up of expenses. While the airline’s capacity and revenue rose as it added two planes and carried five million passengers in FY19, losses widened due to an increase in crude oil prices and a weak rupee. On average, aviation turbine fuel was 23 per cent costlier in FY19 compared to FY18, while the rupee depreciated over 8 per cent against the US dollar, increasing the costs for domestic carriers. Other domestic airlines, too, posted dismal results in the last financial year. InterGlobe Aviation, which runs the country's largest airline by market share, IndiGo, saw its net profit decline 93 per cent to Rs 156 crore, while SpiceJet posted a loss of Rs 316 crore after a profitable FY18.

New paradigms in purpose, ownership and engagement. 01New paradigms in purpose, ownership and engagement. A character-building","By Antonio Argandoña They say crisis reveals character, and the coronavirus crisis has certainly revealed what we’re made of. As country after country adopted emergency measures, businesses began to show their true colors. Some rose to the occasion. Yet, we can also find media stories of businesses that have not reacted so well. While every company has been forced to do some form of damage control, some of the damage has been of their own making. As one headline reminds us: “How companies behave amid coronavirus will determine their fate later.” In one of the live sessions that we began offering on LinkedIn, a participant asked: “Is redundancy compatible with having shareholders and investment funds that only expect short-term profits and returns?” To which my colleague Miguel A. Ariño responded with an emphatic “No.” While sensitivities are changing in this regard, he admitted that this mindset still hadn’t filtered through to many directors. The crisis has forced the world to stop and think. “The last global crisis didn’t change the world. But this one could,” wrote one business commentator. With a global recession quite certain, the stakes are literally life or death as we decide the path forward. If not “a crisis of capitalism,” the commentator continued, “it might better be understood as the sort of world-making event that allows for new economic and intellectual beginnings.” That’s what this issue of IESE Business School Insight provides: food for thought on where the governance models that have guided our companies may need to go next. Our report, completed just as the coronavirus was declared a pandemic, continues an important conversation that for IESE began long ago; that was given fresh impetus by the U.S. Business Roundtable and Davos manifestos; and that now seems of utmost urgency as we adjust our businesses and societies to the new normal.
