0,interactive investor,Are these travel stocks a passport to riches?. Travel and leisure sector. Tale of the tape. Travel. Leisure. Three stocks,"Share on: In our FTSE Sector Watch column, Richard Hunter suggests a trio of stocks to watch given that global tourism is booming. Travel and leisure is an intriguing sector at the moment. On the one hand it has obvious attractions (we tend to go on holiday whatever the economic weather), yet it’s one that’s being buffeted by global economic concerns. As defined by the London Stock Exchange (we are limiting the scope of this article to the FTSE 100 index), the sector comprises six firms, the details of which are highlighted below and in the Tape table. Carnival is a UK-based cruise firm that provides leisure travel to major cruise destinations around the world. Its portfolio of cruise brands includes Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Cunard and P&O Cruises. Flutter Entertainment was formerly known as Paddy Power Betfair. It is a UK-based gaming and sports betting operator, although its markets are also international. InterContinental Hotels Group owns, manages, franchises, and leases hotels and resorts. It operates hotels under its brands, which include InterContinental Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn. International Consolidated Airlines Group is in the operation of international and domestic scheduled air services for the carriage of passengers and cargo. It operates through airlines including British Airways, Iberia and Vueling. TUI AG is an integrated leisure tourism company that offers holiday planning, booking, flights, accommodation, transfers and other activities. Whitbread operates hotels and restaurants, and is largely represented by the Premier Inn brand, which provides services in relation to accommodation in the UK and internationally. The company’s restaurant brands include Beefeater and Brewers Fayre. Sources: Digital Look/ProQuote/FT, as at 23 October 2019 As is clear from some of the one-year share price movements in the table, the potential of the travel sector has not been realised in the recent past. Such potential is evidenced by the World Tourism Organisation (UNTWO) reporting a record 1.4 billion of international tourist arrivals in 2018, 6% up from the year before, equating to $1.7 trillion (£1.3 trillion) of spending, itself equivalent to around 2% of total global GDP. By way of context, the number of tourist arrivals was 25 million in 1950, 166 million in 1970 and 435 million in 1990. The drivers for this growth remain intact, the most recent being the revolution of online bookings and online reviews, which has both increased satisfaction and reduced prices, meaning more people are travelling","Dec 3, 2019",https://www.ii.co.uk/analysis-commentary/are-these-travel-stocks-passport-riches-ii512856
1,We Think Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt - Simply Wall St News,We Think Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt. When Is Debt Dangerous?. What Is Southwest Airlines's,"Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating? Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Southwest Airlines had debt of US$2.39b at the end of September 2019, a reduction from US$3.47b over a year. But on the other hand it also has US$4.02b in cash, leading to a US$1.63b net cash position. We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Southwest Airlines had liabilities of US$8.63b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$7.91b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$4.02b as well as receivables valued at US$867.0m due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$11.7b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables. This deficit isn't so bad because Southwest Airlines is worth a massive US$30.3b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Southwest Airlines boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!

f you are ready to buy your first stocks but aren't sure which ones to choose, you've come to the right place. There are a few characteristics of stocks that are good for beginners, as well as some practices beginners should specifically avoid when selecting the first companies for their portfolios. Here's a rundown of what you should look for and stay away from when choosing your first stocks, as well as a few examples of excellent beginner-friendly stocks to help get your search started. Image source: Getty Images. Stocks are a great way to build wealth over time, but not all stock investments are appropriate for beginner investors. We'll get to some of the characteristics that beginners should avoid later, but for now, let's take a look at some of the things beginners should look for when evaluating stocks. You might hear experienced investors talk about the concept of a ""wide moat,"" especially if you're reading anything about Warren Buffett's investment style. Just as a wide moat around a castle makes it difficult for enemies to invade, a company should have a ""wide moat,"" too: a sustainable competitive advantage that will prevent competitors from stealing that company's market share. These types of advantages can take many forms, but they aren't terribly difficult to spot if you know what to look for. The majority of sustainable competitive advantages typically fall into one of these categories: In addition to sustainable competitive advantages, there are a few other things a beginner might want to seek out when picking stocks: To be perfectly clear, knowing how to identify great businesses is more important than being able to identify cheap stocks for beginners. A great business will typically be a good long-term performer, even if you buy in at a bit of an expensive valuation. On the other hand, a bad business that you invest in at a cheap valuation will seldom work out well. Having said that, once you've learned how to find good candidates for beginners to invest in, some basic metrics can help you narrow them down: You can learn many other investing metrics, some of which can help you find value stocks and some that can help you evaluate fast-growing companies. You can learn as you go, but these should help you get started.

It’s stock buybacks, according to Deutsche Bank. By: Ben Brown | Email | Leave a comment The US stock market bull run has been raging for a decade. But what’s driving this record-breaking rally? It’s not real investors, according to new Deutsche Bank metrics. It’s stock buybacks. Latest data, shared by The Welt’s Holger Schaepitz, shows that the US companies are getting high on their own supply. Corporate share buyback programs – whereby companies purchase their own shares – are powering this record-breaking stock market run. The biggest driver of the rally in the stock market since 2009? Buybacks.  As you can see in the chart above, ‘non-financial corporations’ account for more cumulative US equity purchases than any other category. Almost $4 trillion in total value since 2009. In other words, US companies like Apple, Microsoft etc. are buying more equities than foreign and domestic investors. And they’re buying their own shares. “Since 2012, Apple has been buying back shares at the extraordinary rate of $10 billion per quarter. A year ago, it picked up the pace to around $20 billion per quarter” – Apple Insider. Apple isn’t alone. Microsoft just announced a $40 billion share buyback program. Earlier this year, Target pledged to buy $5 billion of its own stock. Procter & Gamble and Wells Fargo routinely buy their own shares. Simply, to inflate the value of their stock price. Let’s say Apple buys 100 million","Dec 2, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/real-reason-stock-market-all-time-high/

The Dow Jones recoiled on Monday, relinquishing its gains and diving more than 200 points into decline. Here are five reasons why. By: Josiah Wilmoth | Email | Leave a comment Monday looked to bring a slight recovery to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which opened to modest gains that carried the index back toward all-time highs. But the rally didn’t hold, and by the afternoon, the Dow had careened toward its second straight triple-digit loss. Shortly before Monday’s closing bell, the Dow had lost 233.77 points or 0.83%. The index currently sits at 27,817.64 – nearly 300 points below its session high. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also incurred losses, sliding 0.73% and 1.05%, respectively. Here are five primary catalysts that may have contributed to the stock market’s sell-off today. Dismal economic data served as the immediate catalyst for the stock market’s steep plunge. The US manufacturing sector has struggled to mitigate the damage from the US-China trade war. Economists expected today’s ISM Manufacturing PMI reading to come in below 50 – indicating another contraction – but the scale of that decline far outstripped analyst fears. Manufacturing PMI printed a 48.1, missing the forecast of 49.2 by a considerable margin. While a Manufacturing PMI contraction was expected, it incited renewed recession warnings. This index has now contracted for four straight months. In the past, this has been a reliable – though by no means ironclad – leading indicator of an economic downturn. This indicator has produced a number of false positives, but","Dec 2, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/5-reasons-dow-nosedive-today/

Stock in Humana fell less than the,"  Barron’s brings retirement planning and advice to you in a weekly wrap-up of our articles about preparing for life after work.  Managed-care giants Humana and UnitedHealth Group both reaffirmed their full-year 2019 earnings forecasts on Monday, issuing updates that kept expectations within previously outlined ranges. Shares of Humana (ticker: HUM) were down slightly, marking a smaller dip than the broader market, as management said it was reaffirming its guidance of adjusted earnings per share of $17.75 for 2019. The Wall Street consensus estimate is $17.77 per share, according to FactSet. Humana executives had said during the company’s third-quarter earnings presentation in early November that they expected full-year 2019 adjusted EPS of $17.75. Those earnings would reflect a significant bump from the $14.55 the company earned per share in 2018. The company attributed the increase to stronger results in its retail division. UnitedHealth (UNH) said it expected adjusted net earnings for 2019 “to approach $15.00 per share.” It had previously said it expected earnings of between $14.90 and $15 per share. The back story. Humana shares are outperforming those of the company’s managed-care peers this year, with a year-to-date gain of 18.1%, while the S&P 500 Managed Health Care subindustry index was up 12.6%. The S&P 500 is up 24.2%. In a feature story in June
, Barron’s argued that Humana shares were undervalued, and that Humana’s focus on Medicare Advantage, a private-style program within Medicare, offered it a significant advantage over its competitors. Shares of Humana are up 25.2% since the article ran.  What’s new. Humana, in a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it was reaffirming the guidance it had previously issued in November, and would be discussing the forecasts at various investor meetings this month. The company also said that it expected diluted EPS of $18.32. The filing came the same day as Humana competitor UnitedHealth Group (UNH) issued its own guidance update in advance of an investor day scheduled for Tuesday, saying it expected 2019 revenues of $242 billion and adjusted net earnings of nearly $15 per share. UnitedHealth said it expected adjusted net earnings of between $16.25 and $16.55 per share in 2020. “That guidance was very much in-line with expectations,” said Jefferies analyst David Windley in a Monday note on UnitedHealth.

12,Rating Definition,Rating. What Is a Rating?. KEY TAKEAWAYS. How a Rating Works. . Types of Ratings. Analyst Ratings. Rating Agency Ratings,"A rating is an assessment tool assigned by an analyst or rating agency to a stock or bond. The rating assigned indicates the stock or bond's level of investment opportunity. The three major rating agencies are Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch.  Analysts that work on both the buy and sell-side of the industry research stocks and write opinions on those stocks, which will often include a rating, such as buy, hold or sell. Meanwhile, bonds are rated by various organizations, such as Moody's.  A company can improve its rating score by having maintaining as little debt as possible and staying vigilant when sudden changes occur within the company. Analysts on the buy-side will write opinions for their teams for the purposes of informing portfolio management decisions. Analysts on the sell-side will write opinions to educate others on their research and in an attempt to sell particular stocks. For a stock, an analyst may assign a buy, hold, or sell rating and an explanation of why they recommend this action for the stock.  When it comes to major Wall Street banks and institutions, they all have different terminology and classifications. To label stocks Goldman Sachs, for example, uses specific terms. These terms include market outperformer, market performer, and market underperformer. The time frame for Goldman Sachs recommendations is six to 18 months. Morgan Stanley uses the terms overweight, equal-weight, and underweight. The timeline for their ratings is 12 to 18 months. Credit Suisse uses the terms outperform, neutral, and underperform, which is based on a 12-month time period. All of these terms are unique variations of the buy, hold, and sell ratings. For a bond, a rating agency will assess the bond's relative safety based upon the issuing entity's fundamental financial picture, which scrutinizes the issuer's ability to repay the principal and make interest payments. The ratings for Moody's and S&P from highest to lowest in the investment grade category are Aaa/AAA, Aa1/AA+, Aa2/AA, Aa3/AA-, A1/A+, A2/A, A3/A-, Baa1/BBB+, Baa2/BBB and Baa3/BBB-.

Top Picks.,"    Latest Videos  Most Popular Content Dec 3, 2019  Justin Bachman, Siddharth Philip and Julie Johnsson, Bloomberg News An Airbus SE A321 Neo aircraft, operated by FLC Group JSC's Bamboo Airways, stands on the tarmac on the first day of the airline's operations at Phu Cat Airport in Qui Nhon, Vietnam, on Wednesday, Jan. 16, 2019. The International Air Transport Association forecasts Vietnam will be among the world’s top five fastest-growing air travel markets in the next 20 years. , Bloomberg United Airlines Holdings Inc. ordered its first long-range Airbus SE A321neo jets, dealing a new setback to Boeing Co. as the U.S. planemaker struggles through the grounding of its 737 Max. The carrier said it would take 50 of Airbus’s A321XL jets, with deliveries to begin in 2024 -- a year after the model’s planned debut. Valued at US$7.1 billion before customary discounts, the order expands the U.S. foothold of a single-aisle variant capable of handling North Atlantic routes. United plans to start replacing its Boeing 757-200 jets with the XLR, the jet closest to the U.S. manufacturer’s aging model, which went out of production about 15 years ago. Boeing has postponed deciding whether to develop a new plane of comparable size while it attempts to end the grounding of its workhorse Max, which was banned from the skies in March after two deadly crashes. “The new Airbus A321XLR aircraft is an ideal one-for-one replacement for the older, less-efficient aircraft currently operating between some of the most vital cities in our intercontinental network,” Andrew Nocella, United’s chief commercial officer, said in a statement Tuesday. A350 Deferral United also said it would defer its order of twin-aisle Airbus A350 jets to 2027 “to better align with the carrier’s operational needs.” The airline’s XLR deal is particularly noteworthy since Chicago-based United is one of the largest customers of Boeing’s 737 Max 10 planes, with 100 on order. While that Max variant is designed to haul passenger loads similar to those of the A321, it will lack the range to tackle nine-hour flights like the XLR. American Airlines Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. have already ordered Airbus’s XLR. The European aerospace giant launched the model, its longest-range single-aisle aircraft, in June at the Paris Air Show. The plane can fly as far as 4,700 nautical miles, or 15 per cent more than the A321LR model.

The body had earlier delivered an ultimatum to the airline that a failure to find new cash or investors before Saturday could lead to the suspension, or even termination, of its licence.","Dec 3, 2019",https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3040307/owner-failing-hong-kong-airlines-gets-hk44-billion-loan

16,2 Real Estate ETFs That Can Carry You to Retirement - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . 2 Real Estate ETFs That Can Carry You to Retirement. Downsides of,"      Everett Taves | December 2, 2019 | More on: ZRE Passive income is a fantastic way to build wealth. It could be defined as a way to earn money while not actually working. Passive income can be created in many ways, but real estate investing is one of the most popular. The idea of passive income is one that should be appealing to any investor. When being paid passive income, you are technically being paid to sleep. With real estate investing, there are many ways to build passive-income streams. In fact, there are so many that it can be difficult to choose which way works for you. Some methods require you to be a landlord, which isn’t true passive income and can come with a lot of issues. It can require constant work and a lot of your time just to break even. By far the easiest way to get into real estate investing is by buying real estate investment trusts, or REITs. There are many REITs to pick from, and all of them have different strategies for creating wealth. Picking individual REITs can be a daunting task, and it may seem overwhelming to pick a winning one. Although quality REITs do exist, like Choice Properties and SmartCentres, you can never guarantee they’ll keep winning. The issue of picking REITs and creating reliable passive income is why I want to introduce you Fools to two of my favourite REIT exchange-traded funds (ETFs). CI First Asset Canadian REIT ETF (TSX:RIT) and BMO Equal Weight REITs Index ETF (TSX:ZRE) are two REIT ETFs that aim to do similar things through slightly different strategies. They both pay respectable dividends, with CI First Asset’s Canadian REIT ETF (CI) paying a 4.3% yield and BMO’s Equal Weight REITs Index ETF (BMO) paying 4.1%. CI has a slightly higher management expense ratio (MER) of 0.9% compared to BMO’s MER of 0.61%. Investing in CI will offer you an actively managed fund, which has a history of higher returns and a high yield. It also comes with a slightly lower beta of 0.51 compared to BMO’s 0.58. CI has the ability to move in and out of REITs as it sees fit, which can offer downside protection as well as more upside. The history of higher returns, lower beta, and higher yield seem more than enough for me to justify the","Dec 2, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/12/02/2-real-estate-etfs-that-can-carry-you-to-retirement/

FTSE Russell will announce its December 2019 quarterly review this week, which will see both new constituents added to and removed from the FTSE 100 index. Rules for inclusion and exclusion are based on market cap size, relative positioning among other criteria. Looking at market cap information from both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, Exhibit 1 predicts the constituents who are likely to join and leave the FTSE 100 index. Based solely on market cap, possible additions to the index include easyJet, Just Eat, and GVC Holdings, while Hiscox, Fresnillo, and Kingfisher are likely to exit. Exhibit 1: Market Cap for FTSE Constituents as of Nov. 30, 2019  Quarter-to-date, easyJet, GVC Holdings, and Just Eat have seen share price increases of 16.3%, 14.6%, and 14.4% respectively, while Kingfisher, Fresnillo, and Hiscox have seen price moves of 3.3%, -15.5%, and -17.9% respectively. Shares of Just Eat jumped 24.2% on Oct. 22 after it received a takeover offer from Prosus, which was rejected. Just Eat intends to merge with rival Takeaway.com. Let’s analyze the new possible joiners, looking at the StarMine Analyst Revisions Model (ARM). ARM is a stock ranking model based on changes in analysts’ estimates (typically EPS, EBITDA and revenue) and changes in recommendations for the current period, full year and next year. Future revisions are positively correlated with price changes — valuable insight for active investors. ARM ranks companies on a percentile basis from 1 (worst) – 100 (best) vs. its peers on a regional basis (developed Europe in this example). Sentiment appears to be neutral for both easyJet (61) and Just Eat (39). GVC Holdings has positive sentiment among analysts with a model score of 80. According to analysts polled by I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, earnings per share (EPS) and revenue estimates for easyJet (FY21) have declined substantially by 22.6% and 6.4% respectively. Just Eat (FY20) EPS estimates have declined by 45.1%. EasyJet has been a long-standing member of the FTSE 100, appearing in the index from March 2013 to June 2019.

IDBI Bank raises Rs 1,435 crore from 44","SATYENDRA PANDEY @spandey16 This is the first installment of a two-part article on IndiGo’s shift from LCC strategy.  In recent years, IndiGo has launched a series of significant steps, making a marked departure from a pure low-cost strategy, long its mainstay and which helped it become India’s largest airline. As the airline spreads its wings, the extent of its ambitions is becoming clear. IndiGo is no longer content being the dominant domestic airline in India. It is steadily positioning itself to become a major player in the international segment as well. The change has not been sudden. Far from it. The shift — by way of an evolving strategy — has been deliberate. And looking back, one can clearly see a pattern emerge. The low-cost strategy IndiGo started as a pure low-cost carrier (LCC). Elements of the LCC model were made popular by Southwest Airlines in the US and then copied the world over. A raft of LCCs sprung up all over the globe. The disciplined airlines that were devoted to the core principles of the LCC business model thrived. The salient principles of the LCC model are a focus on short-haul sectors, no-frills, point-to-point flights, and low fares delivered via a single fleet and engine type. Complexity for this model was (and is) akin to a cancer and kept at bay. Genuine LCC airlines utilize their assets to the hilt, with fast turnarounds, minimal ground times and stubborn about stifling costs. Rather than building a network spread across several points, they focus on maximising frequencies, allowing for amortization of fixed costs over a greater spread. They also consistently offer low fares, which are a key determinant of demand, especially in price-sensitive markets such as India. The foundation was the fleet order IndiGo was formed when Rahul Bhatia from the promoter group InterGlobe Enteprises and aviation veteran Rakesh Gangwal decided to join hands. Bhatia at the time ran InterGlobe, which was well known but within travel circles. Gangwal was a seasoned airline executive, having led several airlines and transformations. The duo arrived on the scene with an announcement of a 100 aircraft order at the Paris Airshow in 2005. Everyone stood up and took note. This massive fleet order set the foundation for IndiGo and the method of financing aircraft via the sale-and-leaseback method was cash-accretive for the airline. The airline continued to scale and soon overtook its competitors.","Dec 2, 2019",https://www.cnbctv18.com/aviation/indigo-has-abandoned-its-pure-low-cost-carrier-model-4798861.htm
