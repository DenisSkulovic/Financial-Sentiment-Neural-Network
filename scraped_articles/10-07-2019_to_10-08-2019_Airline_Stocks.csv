0,Two ETFs That Focus on Airlines Are Better Than United (UAL) Stock | InvestorPlace,Any of These 3 ETFs Is a Better Option Than United Airlines Stock . The WTO ruling makes airline stocks," United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) stock fell 5.7% on Oct. 2 because of the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) approval of $7.5 billion of U.S. tariffs on aircraft parts made in the EU.     The decision by the WTO was its largest in dollar terms since it was founded in 1995. Airline stocks sold off on the ruling. All the major airline stocks, including United Airlines, fell by several percent.  As a result of this recent swoon by airline stocks, in 2019, UAL stock, including dividends, is down 0.6%. Airline stocks overall are up 2.5%, but that’s a meaningfully weaker performance than the overall market. At the end of August, InvestorPlace contributor Louis Navellier discussed some of the reasons why the airlines were hurting. Between the grounding of Boeing’s (NYSE:BA) 737 Max and the protests in Hong Kong, which resulted in hundreds of flights into and out of the city being canceled,  the airlines have been facing a tremendous amount of  uncertainty. The WTO’s decision to approve President Trump’s tariffs certainly didn’t help.  11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021 But United announced solid earnings in mid-July. Its earnings per share came in at $4.21, 14 cents higher than the Zacks consensus estimate and 30.3% above its earnings a year earlier. On the top line, its revenues jumped 5.8% YoY to $11.4 billion.  UAL’s Q3 earnings are due to come out on Oct. 16 before the markets open. Despite the headwinds facing the industry, I’m sure the results will be just fine.  The question is whether anything can get United Airlines stock out of its rut. Sometimes, when gamblers don’t know which horse is going to win the race, they bet on the field.  Investors might want to follow that strategy when it comes to airline stocks. Investors who like UAL stock but aren’t sure if it’s going to start moving meaningfully higher anytime soon will want to own an ETF whose holdings include a significant amount of UAL.  The best pure-play option which provides meaningful exposure to UAL stock and is focused primarily on airlines is U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS). Airlines account for 88.2% of the ETFs $47.8 million of net assets. UAL stock, which accounts for 12% of JETS’ holdings, is the ETF’s second-largest asset, slightly behind Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).  Of course, fees should also be","Oct 7, 2019",https://investorplace.com/2019/10/any-of-these-3-etfs-is-a-better-option-than-united-airlines-stock/
1,Why Did US Airline Stocks Fall Last Week?,Why Did US Airline Stocks Fall Last Week?. Why did airline stocks fall?. Economic slowdown . Airline stocks’ YTD performance,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Last week, the broader market sell-off battered US airline stocks. New tariffs on Airbus planes and dismal economic data impacted US airlines’ long-term growth prospects. Among US carriers, Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell the most last week with a decline of 7.7%. American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), and JetBlue stocks fell 4.4%, 4.4%, and 2.6%, respectively. The iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT), which has allocated about 20% of its funds in passenger airline stocks, fell 3%. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) index also lost 3% of its market value. The major sell-off came after the US won a 15-year unfair trade practice case against the EU. On October 2, the WTO (World Trade Organization) found that the EU provided illegal subsidies to Airbus. In the ruling, the WTO allowed the US to tariff European-made goods worth $7.5 billion. In April, the Trump administration said that civil, cargo, and passenger planes are on the priority list for imposing tariffs. As a result, the WTO’s ruling made investors cautious about US airlines’ long-term growth prospects. Airline stocks fell on October 3 after the US government announced a 10% tariff on European-made airplanes. The new tax would make Airbus’ aircraft more expensive, which would hurt US airlines that have placed orders with the company. The hefty import duty would have a negative impact on US airlines’ profits, cash flows, and future investment plans. Together, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and JetBlue are waiting for deliveries of approximately 570 planes from Airbus. The Trump administration’s latest move could make trade tensions worse between the US and the EU. The two parties have already imposed import duties on billions of dollars worth of goods. The EU might react to the latest tariff on Airbus. Notably, the EU filed a similar case against the US for providing unfair concessions to Boeing. The final ruling is expected in early January. Industry experts think that the ruling will favor the EU. Therefore, we think that US airlines could get trapped in the middle of the trade war between the US and the EU. Last week, the downside in airline stocks was also due to fears of a global economic slowdown. The latest manufacturing and services data released by the ISM reflects the trade and production slowdown in the US. On October 1, the ISM reported a lower manufacturing PMI for","Oct 7, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/10/why-did-us-airline-stocks-fall-last-week/

Senior Vice President Thierry Bernard will act as interim CEO and work in tandem with CFO Roland Sackers, while Schatz will remain as a “special advisor” during the transition, the company announced in a press release.

5,Hawaiian Holdings Investors Just Got Great News and Bad News | The Motley Fool,Hawaiian Holdings Investors Just Got Great News and Bad News. Hawaiian Airlines' plan to form an immunized joint venture with,"   Shares of Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) have been stuck in a downtrend for nearly three years, falling from a high above $60 in late 2016 to around $25 recently. Rising fuel prices and nonfuel unit cost inflation began to put pressure on the airline's profitability in 2017 and 2018. Increased competition in the West Coast-Hawaii market and on interisland flights within Hawaii have inflicted further pain since the beginning of last year. Hawaiian Airlines suffered another blow last week, as the Department of Transportation tentatively rejected its request for antitrust immunity for its planned joint venture with Japan Airlines (JAL). However, investors received some much better news this week, as Hawaiian raised its third-quarter forecast. Over the past decade or so, international joint ventures with antitrust immunity have become a widespread feature of the U.S. airline industry. Numerous pairs (or larger groups) of carriers have convinced federal regulators that by coordinating scheduling and pricing, they can offer more efficient and more frequent service on international routes. The DOT believes that in many cases, granting antitrust immunity can lead to lower fares on average by promoting capacity growth, even though the joint venture partners are no longer competing against one another. Hawaiian Airlines and JAL decided last year to work toward a similar antitrust-immunized joint venture, covering flights from Hawaii to Japan and other points in Asia. The joint venture promised to give Hawaiian Airlines better access to connecting traffic from markets in Japan and the rest of Asia that it can't efficiently serve with nonstop flights. HAWAIIAN AIRLINES WANTS TO FORM A JOINT VENTURE WITH JAL, THE PARENT OF JAPAN AIRLINES. IMAGE SOURCE: HAWAIIAN AIRLINES. DOT regulators accepted most of the arguments in favor of closer cooperation between JAL and Hawaiian Airlines. However, they believe that most of the benefits could be obtained without coordinated scheduling and pricing, making antitrust immunity unnecessary. Many of the regulators' arguments seem poorly reasoned. Most notably, they point to Hawaiian Airlines' planned growth in the Japan-Hawaii market over the next six months as evidence that antitrust immunity is not necessary to encourage the carrier to add new service to Japan. But Hawaiian may have planned some of those new flights on the assumption that it would soon receive antitrust immunity for its JAL joint venture. Without antitrust immunity, there's a risk that it may have to reverse some of its expansion, depending","Oct 8, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/08/hawaiian-holdings-investors-just-got-great-news-an.aspx
6,"Don’t buy Air Canada stock right now, this investor says - Cantech Letter","Don’t buy Air Canada stock right now, this investor says. About The Author / Nick Waddell. Cantech Letter founder and","     BBTV sees Insider Buying Is Burcon Nutrascience still cheap? Healthcare stock picks from Mackie RBC, BlackBerry Wishpond begins trading    David Cockfield has nothing but praise for Air Canada (Air Canada Stock Quote, Chart, News TSX:AC), whose stock has performed excellently this year. But that doesn’t mean he’s buying AC. The calculation is simple, the portfolio manager says: with the genuine threat of a worsening global economy on the horizon, investors should be staying away from the airlines. Air Canada has gone through a dramatic turnaround over the past half-decade from being a debt-laden train wreck to the sleek, profit-making machine that it is today. The difference is clear from the company’s share price, too, where at the nadir of its troubles, AC was going for less than a dollar whereas today the stock is up 67 per cent year-to-date and up over 230 per cent over the past three years. According to the Bloomberg World Airlines Index, Air Canada has been the best-performing airline stock so far in 2019. But all those glowing numbers shouldn’t distract you from the fact that airlines are notoriously prone to underperform during periods of economic tightening, says Cockfield, managing director and portfolio manager for Northland Wealth Management. “As a long-term investor, I can remember some painful periods with airlines in the past,” said Cockfield to BNN Bloomberg on Friday. “They came and went and came and went.” “Air Canada has done an excellent job of building its client base and they’ve managed to escape some of the criticism that some of the other airlines have faced,” he says. “But it’s still an airline and the airline business is very fragile if there’s any kind of economic pullback. People just stop travelling.” “I’d be cautious about adding to Air Canada at this particular point in time,” says Cockfield. “I’m not that positive in terms of the economic outlook in 2020. Despite the fact that the multiple is quite low —but there’s hardly any yield to the stock— I would sit on the sidelines as far as Air Canada goes.” Air Canada last reported its quarterly earnings at the end of July where management noted that the worldwide grounding of Boeing-made 737 Max jets was affecting the company’s profit growth and driving up costs as the airline scrambled to find other planes to accommodate the grounding of its","Oct 7, 2019",https://www.cantechletter.com/2019/10/dont-by-air-canada-stock-right-now-this-investor-says/

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Deutsche Lufthansa AG (ETR:LHA), which is in the airlines business, and is based in Germany, received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the XTRA over the last few months, increasing to €15.39 at one point, and dropping to the lows of €12.85. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Deutsche Lufthansa's current trading price of €13.94 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Deutsche Lufthansa’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Deutsche Lufthansa Good news, investors! Deutsche Lufthansa is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is €18.34, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Deutsche Lufthansa’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range. Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 47% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Deutsche Lufthansa. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

12,7 Underpriced Stocks With Biggest Upside as Market Stages 4Q Rally,7 Underpriced Stocks With Biggest Upside as Market Stages 4Q Rally. . KEY TAKEAWAYS. Significance For Investors. Schlumberger. American Airlines.,"Despite major market headwinds, Goldman Sachs says a long list of stocks have huge upside over the next year, including 7 stocks with superior potential implied by their target prices. These stocks are expected to benefit disproportionately as the broader market rises in 4Q. David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, expects a rally that will send the S&P 500 Index to 3,100 by the end of 2019, for a gain of 5.5% from the close on Oct. 7, Business Insider reports. If that rally emerges as predicted, among the stocks that would benefit include, with their approximate upsides: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX), +50%, Discovery Inc. (DISCA), +50%, Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), +52%, Concho Resources Inc. (CXO), +53%, American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), +59%, Under Armour Inc. (UAA), +65%, and Align Technology Inc. (ALGN), +75%, per Business Insider. The upsides listed above represent the differences between Goldman's 12-month price targets and the closing prices of these stocks on Sept. 30, the last day of 3Q 2019. Kostin sees uncertainties fostered by the unresolved trade war between the U.S. and China as a major factor behind the sideways movement of the stock market in recent months, per a note to clients cited by BI. ""Mixed economic data and mounting political uncertainty"" characterize the current macro environment, according to the latest edition of Goldman's US Weekly Kickstart report. The ISM Manufacturing Index fell in both August and September, sinking to its lowest reading since March 2009, which was during the Great Recession of 2007-2009, and the month when the last bear market hit bottom. On the other hand, Goldman notes that hiring is proceeding at a brisk pace, with 136,000 new jobs in September. The unemployment rate is down to 3.5%, a 50-year low. This should bolster consumer spending, which represents about 68% of U.S. GDP. Other analysts beyond Goldman see upward potential in several of these stocks. Shares of oil services company Schlumberger were 50% below their 52-week high as of the close on Oct. 7. Connor Lynagh, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, also has rated the stock a buy, with a price target of $51, or 60% above the Oct. 7 close, per a report in Barron's. New CEO Olivier Le Peuch, in that role since Aug. 1, is focusing on increasing profit margins, free cash flow, and returns on capital, the latter partly through making the company less capital-intensive.

13,Equipment Trust Certificate (ETC) Definition,Equipment Trust Certificate (ETC). What Is an Equipment Trust Certificate?. KEY TAKEAWAYS. Understanding Equipment Trust Certificates. . Enhanced Equipment Trust,"An equipment trust certificate (ETC) refers to a debt instrument that allows a company to take possession of and enjoy the use of an asset while paying for it over time. The debt issue is secured by the equipment or physical asset. During this time, the title for the equipment is held in trust for the holders of the issue. ETCs were originally put in place to finance the purchase of railway cars, but are now used in the sale and purchase of aircraft and shipping containers. Equipment trust certificates are medium- to long-term debt instruments that allow a company to use an asset while they pay for it over time. A trust is set up which creates the certificate. Investors can then purchase and hold these certificates. The capital raised from investors allows the trust to purchase the asset, which is then leased to a company. The trust receives payments from the lessee and distributes it among investors or certificate holders. The terms of the agreement are set out at the beginning of the lease relationship including payment dates, interest payments, etc., until such time that the debt is paid off. In other words, an equipment trust certificate is a lot like a mortgage or car loan in that it is a debt vehicle secured by an asset. There are two possible outcomes that may arise from an ETC, both of which depend on the borrower's ability to pay. If the borrower maintains payments and pays off the debt, the asset's title is transferred from the holder to the borrower. But, on the other hand, if the borrower defaults, the lender or seller has the right to repossess or foreclose on the asset. If the borrower defaults on the terms of the ETC, the lender or seller can reclaim the asset. These certificates were originally used to finance railway box-cars and rolling stock, with the box-cars used as collateral. Nowadays, equipment trust certificates are used to finance aircraft purchases and containers used for shipping and offshore businesses. ETCs are a popular way of financing equipment because of the tax advantages associated with them. Since the borrower doesn't hold title to the asset during the financing period, it isn't considered the owner. This means it won't have to pay taxes on it, at least until the debt is paid off in full. An enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) is one","Oct 8, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equipmenttrustcertificate.asp

Stock splits are used by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA to keep share prices within reasonable numbers to encourage investment. If the share price of a security gets too high, a company can perform a stock split by issuing all shareholders an extra share, thereby halving the price of an individual share. If the share price gets too low, companies can do reverse splits. This is common when share prices drop below $1.00 and company's become in danger of being delisted. However, because of the cost, stock splits are not a normal business occurrence. 2019-11-19 barrons.com - This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.
