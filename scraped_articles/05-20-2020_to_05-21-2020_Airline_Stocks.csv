A positive prediction from Delta pulls the","   Airline stocks were getting a second wind in early afternoon trading Wednesday, with shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) leading the charge with a 4.1% gain as of 12:15 p.m. EDT today. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) were not far behind, climbing 4% and 2.5%, respectively. Credit for the surge must go to Delta. Speaking on Fox Business this morning, Delta CEO Edward Bastian predicted that after months of flight reductions, Delta will probably execute a turn in the near future and begin slowly increasing capacity again in June and July.   Currently, the air travel business remains slow, and Delta's load factor is about 35% to 40%, Bastian said. But the company believes it can grow to 60% even if that means keeping middle seats open to promote social distancing on its airplanes.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Bastian added, ""Once we get close to 60% on an individual route, that'll be the trigger for us to add more planes into the system."" Judging from current trends, he believes the company will probably add about 200 flights in June, and then 200 or 300 more in July. And this is a trend he sees continuing over the next 12 to 18 months. Bastian was speaking about domestic travel trends. He cautions that international traffic, which is subject to travel bans and advisories from multiple countries that could slow a recovery, probably won't start coming back until 2021. Still, if a revival is going to happen, domestic travel is probably the place Delta would like to see it happen first. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, in ordinary years, Delta derives more than 70% of its annual revenue from domestic flights, and less than 30% from international travel. And if what holds true for Delta applies to other airlines, then American Airlines and Southwest could benefit from this trend even more. American does 73.5% of its business domestically, and Southwest more than 97%! For that matter, even United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), the U.S. carrier most exposed to international business (37.5% of revenue comes from Atlantic, Pacific, and Latin American travel), should be hoping for a revival of U.S. domestic traffic most of all.

If you can stomach,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Stuart Blair | Thursday, 21st May, 2020 | More on: EZJ IAG WIZZ Airline stocks have evidently been one of the worst affected sectors of the coronavirus pandemic. With heavy restrictions on travel, airlines have been forced to ground their fleets, part ways with a host of their workers and receive government loans to bail them out. But this has left these airline stocks extraordinarily cheap. Therefore, I’d consider buying the following three. Wizz Air (LSE: WIZZ) is the first airline stock that piques my interest. The FTSE 250 member is a low-cost airline that is the market leader in Central and Eastern Europe. It has seen tremendous growth over the past few years, with operating cash flow jumping from c.£178 million in 2015 to c.£421 million last year. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Although Wizz Air passenger numbers have fallen by 98% recently, it is still in a strong position to survive the crisis. Unlike other airline firms, Wizz Air has avoided buying back shares or paying a dividend. This has helped provide liquidity to deal with the crisis and I can certainly see a long-term recovery. International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE: IAG) is the owner of airlines such as British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus. IAG shares have been damaged more significantly than other airline stocks, falling by around 70% since February. Management has also stated that passenger demand will not return to 2019 levels for many years. But I’m confident that IAG will survive the crisis, albeit in a slightly damaged form. The airline has attempted to preserve funds by announcing job cuts, grounding the majority of its fleet and cancelling its dividend. At the end of the first quarter, IAG also had total cash and undrawn facilities of c.€9.3 billion. Whilst I don’t see IAG thriving over the next few years, I still believe that there will be a major recovery from its recent lows.

3,"Buy Southwest and Spirit Stock, Analyst Says. Domestic Air Travel Could Perk Up Soon. | Barron's","2 Airline Stocks With Big Upside as Air Travel Begins to Perk Up. Southwest Airlines has a “fortress” balance sheet,","  Signs that air travel is rebounding could lift shares of low-cost carriers focused on the domestic market, notably Southwest Airlines and Spirit Airlines. The carriers may be some of the biggest early winners in a recovery, according to Cowen analyst Helane Becker. She expects the domestic market to recover more quickly than international routes, and sees gains for low-cost carriers that focus on leisure travelers, particularly Southwest (ticker: LUV) and Spirit (SAVE). The stocks have upside of 38% and 50% from recent prices, respectively, according to her estimates. “As states open, we expect the airlines to see demand for regional traffic increase,” Becker wrote in a note published Thursday. Airlines are seeing stronger demand in Florida, Texas and Colorado, she wrote, and JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is seeing a pickup in sales in flights from the Northeast to Florida, one of its strongest markets. Passenger air travel hit bottom in mid-April when around 87,000 passengers a day passed through TSA checkpoints—down from 2.2 million a year earlier, according to Becker. Passenger traffic has jumped since then, reaching more than 250,000 travelers on May 17, although it is still down more than 90% from a year earlier. Becker isn’t expecting air travel to reach anywhere near 2019 levels this year. Domestic airlines flew 928 million passengers in 2019 with planes 85% full, on average. This year, airlines have carried 42 million passengers and “load factors”—the percentage of a plane with ticketed passengers—are well below 50%. Nonetheless, airlines are implementing new seating and sanitation procedures, including deep-cleaning planes with disinfectant fogging, and they are trying to entice passengers back by blocking middle seats or offering flexibility to rebook if a flight is near capacity. Travelers might still be reluctant to take a long-haul flight to Europe or Asia. And it might be many months until international travel bans and quarantine procedures are lifted. But domestic travel could perk up this summer, especially in the leisure market. Becker recently upgraded Southwest to an Outperform rating and maintained a $40 price target, up from recent prices around $29. The airline said in a filing this week that it expects to see slight improvements in demand and operating revenue in June, and said ticket sales are outpacing cancellations for the first time since March and April. Southwest also has a “fortress” balance sheet, Becker wrote, with $13 billion in cash and available funding that","May 21, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/southwest-airlines-spirit-stock-domestic-air-travel-summer-passengers-pandemic-51590078390

Mighty wings are gone.,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | May 21, 2020 | More on: AC “The world has changed for airlines.” Those were the exact words of Warren Buffett after his admission that investing in the airline industry was a mistake. The billionaire investor had $4 billion invested in four American airline stocks. Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway dumped all its stock holdings in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines. The revelation shook the industry such that few investors will dare take positions in the sector from here on out. Air Canada (TSX:AC) was flying high in 2019 until COVID-19 clipped its wings in 2020. All top global airlines crashed in unison. Air pollution has been diminished significantly, as only cargo planes are taking flight. Canada’s most dominant airline posted $1 billion in losses in the first quarter of this year and continues to bleed. The federal government is in a dilemma and exploring options for saving the drowning air travel sector. The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) is offering a 75% wage subsidy so that employers like Air Canada can keep workers in the payroll or rehire laid-off employees. So far, the country’s flag carrier is not participating in the program. It has until June 6, 2020, to avail, although it could extend up to August 2020. Effective May 11, 2020, the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF) program is available. Large for-profit businesses in all sectors, excluding the financial sector, can apply for the new program. LEEFF will provide at least $60 million bridge-financing to large corporations. Air Canada has yet to confirm if it will avail of LEEFF. The financing access can help contain the bleeding but only in the short term. Fixed costs, such as maintenance costs, among others, are fast rising. With little or no revenues coming in, airline companies are burning vast sums of money. The federal government might need to come up with a specialized program. Otherwise, Air Canada will be dead in the water soon. One of the cost-reduction measures of Canada was the mass layoff. In April, the company laid off some 16,500 employees, including customer service agents, flight attendants, and mechanics. On May 15, 2020, management announced it is letting go of 50-60% of the workforce.

The “most profitable” ASX airline stock you probably never heard of.,"      Brendon Lau | May 21, 2020 5:49pm | More on: AQZ QAN REX VAH ASX 200 Profits are nosediving for our ASX listed airlines as the COVID-19 pandemic grounded nearly all air travel. But there’s one in the sector that’s made a big profit upgrade, and chances are you haven’t heard of the stock before.  The airline is Alliance Aviation Services Ltd (ASX: AQZ), which issued a trading update yesterday and forecasted a FY20 profit before tax (PBT) that is excess of $40 million. This is a big step-up from its March guidance of less than $33 million. Most would have missed the good news as Qantas Airways Limited (ASX: QAN), Regional Express Holdings Ltd (ASX: REX) and the defunct Virgin Australia Holdings Limited (ASX: VAH) dominated headlines. While much is written about the Qantas share price surging 50% since the bear market trough in March, it’s the Alliance Aviation share price that takes the crown for the sector as it flew 155%. Credit Suisse calls Alliance “Australia’s most profitable airline” and management’s profit upgrade is well above the broker’s $24 million PBT estimate for the current financial year. “Some of the significant tailwinds in the 4Q are one-off (namely more FIFO [fly-in, fly-out] flights post social distancing rules),” said the broker. “However, of more relevance are medium-term contracts with new customers won as AQZ steps into the breach vacated by other RPT operators.” Alliance operates Regular Public Transport (RPT), leases aircraft and provides other aviation services. One of its customers was Virgin Australia, which went into voluntary administration but may be brought back to life by new owners. Regardless of what happens to Virgin, Credit Suisse believes Alliance is well placed to benefit in the new post COVID-19 world order. If Virgin is revived, the new operators will likely continue to or expand aircraft leasing from Alliance to contain costs. On the other hand, should Virgin be permanently shuttered, Alliance is best placed to fill the RPT and FIFO hole left by Virgin, explained Credit Suisse. “The second scenario would obviously require additional fleet (particularly given AQZ’s upgraded FIFO presence post recent events) and the market for aircraft presently favours the buyer,” said the broker. Credit Suisse reiterated its “outperform” recommendation on the stock and upgraded its 12-momth price target to $3.20 from $1.90 a share.

View our and newsletter FAQs. All investments carry risk and results are not guaranteed.   The data that has been coming out of the airline industry is astounding… Take April 7, for example, when the Transportation Security Administration notched a new record-low 97,031 passenger screenings. On the same day last year, that number was 2.09 million. That is a year-on-year decrease of more than 95% in the number of passengers getting on planes. Business isn’t bad… Business is gone!
Daily passenger traffic has inched up a little bit in May, but it has hardly started the journey to a full recovery. It goes without saying that this drop in air travelers has been a brutal shock to the revenues of the airline operators – and this has not been lost on the market. The stock prices of the major airlines reflect the difficulty that the industry is facing.
But many investors have been asking… Do these huge share price declines represent a big bargain opportunity? Is now the time to place a bet on the airline industry’s recovery? The world’s most renowned investors have very different answers to that question… Bill Miller: Betting on a Rebound If you aren’t familiar with Bill Miller, here is what you should know: He is the only fund manager in history to have outperformed the S&P 500 for at least 15 years in a row. Miller achieved that feat, then known as “the streak,” from 1991 through 2006 while running money for Legg Mason. It was an incredible accomplishment. At a recent investor roundtable organized by Ariel Investments, Miller pounded the table on why shares of airline operators are major bargains today. I checked the holdings of his fund, Miller Opportunity Trust, and can verify that he has 10% of his portfolio invested in the sector as of April 30. So he is putting his money where his mouth is… While speaking at the Ariel Investments roundtable, Miller explained his interest in owning the airlines as follows… People love flying and don’t worry about catching polio or smallpox since there is a vaccine. If you don’t own the airlines, then you’re making a bet against the vaccine… If there is a vaccine that will eliminate all the issues people have about flying… these (stocks) will come back very, very quickly.

Investors with a time horizon of five years or longer should," American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) may prove to be among the most resilient of the hard hit travel sector. But while it could suffer significantly in the near term, there is still some hope left for AAL stock to rise again.  Things remain gloomy for the airline sector amid the novel coronavirus pandemic that has left airplanes sitting idle on tarmacs around the world. The S&P Supercomposite Airlines Industry Index has fallen about 60% since the market peak of Feb. 20, when a broad global selloff of equities began. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index is down about 12% over the same period. Famed investor Warren Buffett has dumped all his airline holdings, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun has predicted that at least one major U.S. carrier will be kaput by year’s end. Empty planes, rising gas prices and mounting debt loads have many industry observers sounding the death knell for the sector as a whole. Industry trade group Airlines for America claims that U.S. carriers are losing $10 billion a month. As the largest U.S. airline with the most international routes, American Airlines has become the poster child for an industry in crisis. Yet, reports of American Airlines’ demise may be premature. Despite being among the hardest hit sectors during the pandemic lockdown, glimmers of hope are starting to emerge for the airline industry. Shares of airlines soared on May 18 following positive data released by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that showed a growing number of airline passengers passing through its security checkpoints. The data suggests a post-Covid-19 recovery has already taken root. Responding to the TSA numbers, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS) rose 11.6%. Shares of American Airlines jumped 9.2% on the news after closing May 14 at a 52-week low of $8.25 per share. Other airline stocks, including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), also rose on the TSA news. More good news for the industry came on May 19, when Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said it was adding several domestic flights in June as demand for air travel gathers steam. Southwest forecasts that its annual capacity decline will be 45% in June, less severe than May’s annualized capacity decline of 70%.

Your","   Getty Images / Bill Pugliano  The news that Warren Buffett dumped airline stocks in April may have indirectly led to United Airlines walking away from a $2.3 billion fundraising this month.

However, it decided not to pull the trigger after investors demanded an interest rate of about 10% and stronger protections in case it defaulted, the Financial Times reported. The investors wanted better terms because the bonds were backed by roughly 40% of United's planes, and they were concerned that the older models might be tough to sell, the Financial Times said. Buffett's suggestion at the Berkshire meeting that passenger numbers might not fully recover in the next few years, leaving the airlines with ""too many planes,"" may have fueled those worries.

10,Airlines on the verge of bankruptcy: Should we sell stocks?,Airlines on the verge of bankruptcy: Should we sell stocks?. A more in-depth look at airlines stocks. What has changed,"   A month has hardly passed since the publication of my article about airlines, and the market is already full of rumors about one of the largest airlines approaching bankruptcy. In that post, I tried to give the soft version of the situation; moreover, it was my individual opinion which could be a mistake. However, time shows that things are worse than I expected. Today, I will reveal other aspects of risks in the sector of air transportation and give hints on how to make money on airlines stocks; also, we already have the information about the income of airlines in the first quarter. As I wrote earlier, 10 airlines asked the US government for financial help, thus increasing the debt load. As long as the flow of passengers has dried out, the debts will be extremely hard to pay off. Apart from the debt, the company also needs maintenance, which includes expenses on salaries, the maintenance of airplanes, etc. Before airlines got in trouble, clients used to buy tickets several months before the flight with a good discount. One side spent less on their trips while the other could plan flights more efficiently. Rumors started creeping in the market about the upcoming bankruptcy of one of the largest airlines. The first person who mentioned this is officially considered to be the director-general of Boeing (NYSE: BA) David L. Calhoun. However, he never mentioned the exact name of the company that may face it. Nonetheless, his statement alone made many investors doubt whether it is wise to invest in stocks nowadays and many passengers - whether they should buy their tickets beforehand. These days, it has already become very tiresome to seek a refund for your ticket. Only two small companies - Allegiant Air (NASDAQ: ALGT) and Spirit Airlines Inc. (NYSE: SAVE) - keep returning money to their passengers if they refuse to fly, however, even some of their clients have complained that they failed to get their money back. Large airlines generally tend not to give the money back - only in case the flight has been canceled by the airline itself. Otherwise, the client gets a voucher for the sum of the ticket that they may use until a certain date. It is quite easy to draw a conclusion from the current situation.

In a survey conducted by Qualtrics between April 27 - 28, 75% of U.S. adults said they would feel uncomfortable going on a flight. More people feared flying than going to the gym, eating at restaurants or staying at hotels. That's why experts believe the ascent for the sector is going to be slow and not straight upwards.

Domestic and short-haul air travel markets are expected to recover over the course of Q3, but long-haul markets will be slower to recommence.

It also said social distancing would reduce the bookable seat capacity for airlines to 62% of normal capacity, but airlines on average break even only when 77% seats are filled.

Signs that air travel is rebounding could lift shares of low-cost carriers focused on the domestic market, notably
Southwest Airlines
and
Spirit Airlines. The carriers may be some of the biggest early winners in a recovery, according to Cowen analyst Helane Becker. She expects the domestic market to recover more quickly than international routes, and sees gains for low-cost carriers that focus on leisure travelers, particularly Southwest (ticker: LUV) and Spirit (SAVE). The stocks have upside of 38% and 50% from recent prices, respectively, according to her estimates. “As states open, we expect the airlines to see demand for regional traffic increase,” Becker wrote in a note published Thursday. Airlines are seeing stronger demand in Florida, Texas and Colorado, she wrote, and
JetBlue Airways
(JBLU) is seeing a pickup in sales in flights from the Northeast to Florida, one of its strongest markets. Passenger air travel hit bottom in mid-April when around 87,000 passengers a day passed through TSA checkpoints—down from 2.2 million a year earlier, according to Becker. Passenger traffic has jumped since then, reaching more than 250,000 travelers on May 17, although it is still down more than 90% from a year earlier. Becker isn’t expecting air travel to reach anywhere near 2019 levels this year. Domestic airlines flew 928 million passengers in 2019 with planes 85% full, on average. This year, airlines have carried 42 million passengers and “load factors”—the percentage of a plane with ticketed passengers—are well below 50%. Nonetheless, airlines are implementing new seating and sanitation procedures, including deep-cleaning planes with disinfectant fogging, and they are trying to entice passengers back by blocking middle seats or offering flexibility to rebook if a flight is near capacity. Travelers might still be reluctant to take a long-haul flight to Europe or Asia. And it might be many months until international travel bans and quarantine procedures are lifted. But domestic travel could perk up this summer, especially in the leisure market. Becker recently upgraded Southwest to an Outperform rating and maintained a $40 price target, up from recent prices around $29. The airline said in a filing this week that it expects to see slight improvements in demand and operating revenue in June, and said ticket sales are outpacing cancellations for the first time since March and April.
