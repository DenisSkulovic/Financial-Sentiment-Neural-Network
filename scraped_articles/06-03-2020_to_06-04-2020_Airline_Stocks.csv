Here’s BofA’s List of 4 Enterprise Software Stocks to Buy Now.,"  Shares of American Airlines Group soared on Thursday after the airline announced plans to rebuild its summer flight schedule—a sign that demand is slowly recovering after collapsing more than 90% in the past few months.

1,Stock Market News: Why Airline Stocks Gained Altitude Wednesday | The Motley Fool,"Stock Market News: Why Airline Stocks Gained Altitude Wednesday. The stock market had another solid rally, and this industry led","   The stock market continued to gain ground on Wednesday morning, buoyed by hopes for a successful economic recovery along with some positive earnings reports from well-regarded tech companies. Market participants have been increasingly optimistic about the prospects for businesses to bounce back from the disruptions that the coronavirus pandemic has wrought over the past several months. Just before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up 320 points to 26,062. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) had risen 32 points to 3,113, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) had picked up 60 points to 9,668. Airline stocks were among the big winners on Wednesday morning, with gains that easily topped the broader markets' moves higher. Even though the coronavirus-related challenges that airlines face are particularly difficult, investors like the signs they're seeing that suggest travelers want to get back in the air. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Gains in the airline sector Wednesday morning were broad. Among the top four U.S. carriers, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) led the way with gains of 7.5%. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) followed with upward moves of between 5% and 6%, while Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) weighed in with a better than 4% rise. Some of the smaller carriers did even better. Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) and Mesa Air Group (NASDAQ:MESA) were up 11% on the day. No-frills player Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and regional powerhouse JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) managed to gain almost 10%, and Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) was just behind with a 9% boost. SkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW) and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) posted gains of 8% and 7%, respectively. The one thing that all airlines have in common is that they want to see more travelers willing to fly, and trends suggest people are going back into the skies. Although traffic levels remain far below pre-coronavirus levels, the reported number of people moving through TSA checkpoints is now more than three and a half times as high as it was at its worst point in April. Airlines are starting to see upticks in reservation activity, especially among popular destinations sporting beaches or mountainous terrain. To say that airlines have put the pandemic behind them, though, would be extremely premature. Even with signs of improving conditions, the pace of improvement has been slow. Would-be passengers are still waiting to see what post-pandemic travel will look like, and airlines are still struggling to","Jun 3, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/03/stock-market-news-why-airline-stocks-gained-altitu.aspx

The travel order will take effect on June 16. While strict, the ban still allows Chinese carriers to operate one flight to the US for every flight China allows from American firms.  ""Should the CAAC adjust its policies to bring about the necessary improved situation for U.S. carriers, the Department is fully prepared to revisit the action it has announced in this order,"" the Department of Transportation said in its Wednesday order.

Airline stocks are enjoying their best streaks in months as traders bet on a smooth economic reopening and a pickup in travel demand. The sector staged numerous small rallies through March and April before falling further amid coronavirus travel bans. Most of the aforementioned companies now trade at their highest levels since mid-March. The White House's ban serves as President Trump's latest retaliatory strike against China as trade tensions flare the most in months. China halted some imports of US farm goods on Monday, threatening a key element of the two nations' phase-one trade deal.   Despite rising US-China stresses, stocks have gained through the month's first sessions as optimism toward economic recovery outweighs risks from a renewed trade war.

3,"Airline stocks soar as American, United add back flights - ABC News",. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"DALLAS -- Airline stocks soared Thursday after American Airlines said it will aggressively add back flights in July — a bet that the slow recovery in air travel will gain speed this summer as states re-open their economies. United Airlines also announced plans to add back flights, while taking a more cautious approach that includes resuming about 130 nonstop routes in July that were suspended when travel collapsed as the coronavirus spread rapidly. Both airlines will run much smaller operations than they did last summer, but they could exceed the market's low expectations for business during the crucial peak vacation season. American said it plans to operate 55% of the U.S. flights that it ran in July 2019, a huge increase over the 20% schedules it ran in April and May. The airline is more guarded about demand for foreign travel. It plans to operate just 20% of the international flights that it ran last July. American could still cancel many July flights right up until departure time if hoped-for bookings fall through. Shares of American Airlines Group Inc., which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, rose 41% to close at $16.72. That is the stock's biggest one-day percentage gain since the current company was formed by a 2013 merger with US Airways. The shares are still down 42% so far this year. Other airline stocks were carried along in American's slipstream, although they rose by smaller percentages. Chicago-based United's shares closed up 16% before it announced its plans to add back some flights. United will still operate only 30% of its 2019 U.S. schedule in July, but that is up from 13% in June. Both airlines are adding flights to Florida, mountain states and other vacation destinations, indicating that leisure travelers are returning faster than people flying for business. Bookings are still down everywhere, but they are down 80% in the Northeast compared with about 40% in states such as Texas and Florida that have reopened more of their economies, said Vasu Raja, American’s senior vice president of network strategy. “If you're a leisure customer, you know you can go to Florida and the hotels will be open, the restaurants will be open,"" he said. “You're unclear if that will be the case if you go to California.” In April, restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus caused air travel to plummet to levels not seen","Jun 4, 2020",https://abcnews.go.com/Travel/wireStory/american-airlines-soars-wall-street-upbeat-flight-plan-71075418

Stocks"," The v-shaped bounce in airline stocks in the second half of May rewarded investors who bet on the bottom. To sustain the rally, investors will need to start pricing in the daily loss decline as passenger traffic increases. Realistically, airlines cannot operate at more than around 70% capacity on each flight. Maintaining plenty of distance among passengers, equipping staff, and customers with cotton masks and frequent sanitizing will decrease revenue potential and increase costs, respectively. Still, the near-term risks of betting on an airline stock rebound are moderate. The companies have the financial backing of the government and are cutting costs. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) traded at deceptively low price-to-earnings ratios. The P/E and forward P/E will rise sharply and at meaningless values as the company posts losses. Predicting how true recovery plays out is nearly impossible. Investors may only monitor flight schedules, passenger load, and consumer sentiment. If media and the public start talking about ""safe"" vacationing involving flights, then this may signal a decrease in fear. Airlines are a long way from the highs and will not get there for at least a year. They may retrace some of the declines this year.

You can't secure what you can't","June 3, 2020 10:19 PM GMT+3 A once-obscure ETF tracking airlines soared past $1 billion, largely bolstered by day trading. The US Global Jets exchange-traded fund, ticker JETS, posted its 64th consecutive day of inflows on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its growth has been staggering: The ETF held just $33 million in early March as the coronavirus pandemic grounded global air travel. The fund’s top holdings are the four major U.S. airlines, though it said last week that it will begin investing in Canadian carriers as well. Much of that explosive growth in assets can be credited to day traders looking to “catch the bottom” in airline stocks, according to Frank Holmes, chief executive officer of JETS issuer U.S. Global Investors. After speaking with newly minted JETS holders, he says the boredom of being stuck at home and the strong rebound in carriers after the 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis are luring young traders. “All these millennials, being stuck at home with no bars to go to and no beaches to travel to, took their money and became day traders,” said Holmes. “They’re bored, they want to make money.” In particular, the growing popularity of JETS on retail trading platform Robinhood has “shocked” Holmes. The number of users holding JETS surged to nearly 30,000 this week, according to Robintrack, a website unaffiliated with the site that uses its data to show trends in positioning. That compares to 500 at the beginning of March. Not even a warning from billionaire investor Warren Buffett has deterred the army of day traders. Buffett said in early May that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. completely exited its positions in airlines, cautioning that the prospects have changed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Since then, JETS has taken in roughly $294 million worth of inflows. Despite a nearly 21% rebound over the past month, JETS is still nursing a year-to-date plunge of over 45%. The bulk of the fund’s losses came after mid-February once lockdown measures took effect around the globe in an effort to contain the spread of infections. JETS’s recent recovery has further evaporated demand to bet against it. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on JETS -- a rough indicator of bearish bets on the fund -- is currently 0.5%, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. It reached 7.8% in February 2019. However, JETS’s","Jun 3, 2020",https://fortune.com/2020/06/03/airline-etf-jets-assets-soar/

New data suggest they are about to regret that decision wholly. By: Joseph Young | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. Millennials have been scooping up airline stocks that Warren Buffett famously dumped. But new data suggest they are about to regret that decision. Buffett invests in stocks with a long-term investment thesis. When he realized airlines might never be the same in a post-pandemic world, he sold his shares in four airline stocks. But, it seems retail investors bought airline stocks for quick short-term gains. Unfortunately, data are not on their side.   Lufthansa AG, the largest airline in Germany, recorded a net loss of $2.35 billion in the first quarter of 2020. The airline saw a staggering 98.1% decline in passengers year-over-year. Such a significant drop in travelers forced Lufthansa to park 700 airplanes from April to May. Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa’s chairman of the executive board, stated: Global air traffic has come to a virtual standstill in recent months. When airlines park their planes at a local airport, they are required to pay parking and maintenance fees along with aircraft leases. For Lufthansa, necessary costs alone led to $298 million in impairment charges for the first three months of 2020. Indonesia’s most significant private airline Lion Air sees a similar trend. Starting this week, Lion Air will ground 138 aircraft. Its subsidiaries, Batik Air and Wings Air, will also park 140 jets.

While the industry's risk is high, the company's risk"," On June 1, InvestorPlace advisor Louis Navellier had a dose of reality for United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) shareholders, suggesting that the company and, by extension, UAL stock, had tough times ahead.  “There is no relief for United or other airlines in the near future. Business travel has all but stopped during the pandemic. Those highly profitable business class seats may never fill the way they did before … Vacation travel isn’t expected to return to anything remotely resembling ‘normal’ levels until researchers develop and deploy a vaccine. Even then, the worst recession in generations could hobble consumer spending for years to come,” Navellier wrote.  The airline is going to do everything it can to cut its cost structure to the bone over the next year. That includes laying off a big chunk of its staff in the fall once it’s no longer obligated to keep employees on the payroll as part of receiving grants and low-interest loans from the federal government as part of the airline bailout.  I recently took a look at United’s financial situation and the three other major airlines. I concluded that Southwest (NYSE:LUV) had by far the best financial position. That said, I’m still very cautious about airline investments because the risk is much higher than the reward at this point. So, if you think United’s a buy, here’s why I believe the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS) is the smarter move at this point.  Over the past week, the airline industry as a whole generated a total return of 12.9%, 310 basis points less than UAL stock. Score one point for United. However, if you look at the year-to-date total return of the industry, it was down 49.3% through June 1, 17.3 percentage points less than United. Score two points for the industry. If you look at the YTD, one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year returns, the industry wins every time, except for the 10-year performance, where United outperforms it by seven basis points on an annualized basis. Score the industry an easy winner.  As I stated in my recent article about the airlines’ respective finances, Southwest might be the only airline with a net cash position, but that doesn’t guarantee it will be the most successful as the economy recovers from the novel coronavirus. We have no idea how this will play out. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV","Jun 3, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/06/united-airlines-ual-buy-the-entire-industry/
