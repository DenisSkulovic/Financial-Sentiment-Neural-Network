0,Why Airline Shares Are Down Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Down Today. The COVID-19 case numbers are moving in the wrong direction.. What happened. So what.,"   Airline stocks are underperforming the broader markets on Wednesday despite some positive analyst commentary, with investors focused instead on worrisome data about the continuing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) is leading the group lower as of 1 p.m. EDT, down 5%, while shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) were all down more than 2%. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was the best performing U.S. airline stock as of mid-day following the release of some optimistic financial data. Airline stocks have been circling the airport in recent weeks, with investors torn between positive signs that traffic is slowly recovering and ominous headlines reminding that the pandemic is far from resolved. The industry has raised tens of billions in fresh capital and has ample liquidity to survive into the fall, but needs travel demand, and revenue, to return in the months to come to avoid an eventual liquidity crisis. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. On Wednesday, The Washington Post published an analysis saying that nine states, including tourism hotbeds Florida and Texas, either posted new single-day highs or set records for seven-day new case averages. It's unclear whether the growing case numbers will cause states to rethink plans to reopen. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday his state will not shut down again despite posting a record high in new cases. But if there is one thing we've learned this year it is that a pandemic is very hard to predict, and if the case numbers keep growing local officials might not have a choice. The COVID-19 worries are outweighing positive commentary by Seaport Global analyst Daniel McKenzie, who on Wednesday initiated American, Southwest, Spirit, United, and JetBlue Airways as buys. Southwest is holding up better than most thanks to an investor update that indicates the airline is well prepared to deal with an extended downturn. On Wednesday, the company said it has enough cash on hand to survive two years at its current burn rate of about $20 million per day. Airline stocks have become a good measure to use to gauge the day-to-day market sentiment about the spread of the pandemic. For months now, the airlines have tended to move in groups, based more on the prospects for future travel than on individual company news. That's likely to remain the case until we have more clarity about what","Jun 17, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/17/why-airline-shares-are-down-today.aspx

5,"Upbeat News From Delta Air Lines, Southwest, Fails to Lift the Stocks | Barron's",The Latest Upbeat News From Airlines Fails to Lift the Stocks. Delta Air Lines said it expects to end the,"  Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines issued encouraging updates on their operations and financial condition. But their stocks slipped—a sign that incremental improvements may no longer be enough to send airline shares soaring. Delta (ticker: DAL) held its annual shareholder meeting Thursday morning via webcast, providing some encouraging data points that prompted Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent to reiterate his Buy rating on the stock. Among the key takeaways: Delta expects to end the second quarter with $15 billion in liquidity. Delta also said it expects its daily cash-burn rate to reach zero by the end of the year, from $30 million currently. And the carrier plans to close Sky Clubs, saving a few bucks on free drinks and snacks, as it continues looking for ways to trim expenses. More important, Delta updated its forecasts on load factors (the percentage of a flight’s available seats with ticketed passengers). The airline said load factors are in the mid-40s, according to Trent, with the “booking curve” pointing to loads in the 50s. That is still below levels that airlines need to operate profitably, however, and Delta has capped loads at 60% to enforce social distancing. Overall, though, Trent writes that Delta’s comments were positive, with the carrier maintaining solid liquidity and continuing to reduce its consumption of cash. Delta expects that in July, capacity will be down 65% within the U.S., and off 75% internationally, big improvements over April and early May. Delta is encouraging employees to take buyouts, offering higher severance and other benefits for workers who take packages. CEO Ed Bastian also “took personal responsibility for Delta’s support of racial justice and equality,” according to Trent. He has a $38 price target on the stock, implying gains of 26% from recent prices around $30. Despite the encouraging update, Delta has been warning investors that it can only survive for so long without a big pickup in demand. The airline said recently that it is trying to renegotiate some debt covenants and warned that it could default if the talks are unsuccessful. Southwest (LUV), meanwhile, reiterated that it is seeing improvements in passenger demand and bookings (net of cancellations). May operating revenues, capacity, and load factors improved from April, and the airline expects more gains in June and July, with load factors jumping to 45% to 55%. The airline is still limiting available seating and keeping middle seats open through","Jun 18, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/good-news-delta-air-lines-southwest-coronavirus-stocks-liquidity-cash-burn-51592499481

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, Southwest Airlines LUV, United Airlines UAL and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY. Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog: Airline Industry Soars 50%+ in a Month: More Room to Rally? After being on the receiving end of the pandemic crisis that bottled-up air-travel demand, stocks in the airline space finally have something to cheer about. Recently, many aviation stocks issued bullish updates on the back of an improved air-travel demand scenario. The buoyancy is evident from the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has gained 50.8% in the past month compared with the S&P 500 Index’s mere 3.8% rise. Reasons for This Resurgence Reopening of businesses in countries around the globe and easing of travel bans bode well for the airline stocks, which are witnessing a surge in new bookings. Evidently, American Airlines saw 60% growth in July bookings on a year-over-year basis. Management at American Airlines stated that it intends to operate 55% of its scheduled domestic flights in July 2020 compared with the capacity recorded in July 2019. Evidently, the company flew nearly 110,000 passengers per day, on average, in the last week of May, up 71% from the April reading. Moreover, American Airlines aims to operate nearly 20% of its internal flights scheduled for July compared with the last-year level. Also, owing to the recent uptick in air-travel demand alongside cost-cutting initiatives, the carrier projects its cash-burn rate to fall to nearly $40 million per day in June from $100 million in April. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company hopes to reduce its cash-burn rate to zero by Dec 31, 2020. Delta Air Lines too expects to lower its average daily cash outflow to zero by 2020 end.

7,"Travel stocks: Two names could benefit from rebound, market analysts say","These two stocks could be best play on summer travel, market analysts say. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC","It could be the summer of the road trip. As lockdowns slowly lift under the threat of the coronavirus pandemic, two market pros are betting travel demand could pick up outside of airlines and hotels. Strategic Wealth Partners President Mark Tepper told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” he’s been paying close attention to daily TSA passenger numbers. “At the beginning of the year, we were seeing about 2.5 million people per day,” he said Wednesday. “At our worst in April we were all the way down to 100,000 a day. We’re climbing back up: We’re at about 500,000 a day, but that’s 80% below that normal run rate.” Airlines have taken a big hit from the slowdown in air travel. The JETS airline ETF, whose holdings include United and Delta, remains 44% off 52-week highs.  Tepper expects consumers to avoid air travel through the summer. Instead, he is betting on a stock that could benefit from travel by road. One in particular he likes is auto parts supplier O’Reilly. “The vehicles in the U.S., they’re old, and they just keep getting older, you need to fix them up because really nobody’s buying new cars,” he said. “Now people, they’re able to go out, they’re working from home, they have some time on their hands to work on repairs. So I do think O’Reilly is going to bounce back faster than a lot of people expect.” JC O’Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, recommends that investors broaden their exposure across the travel industry rather than pin hopes on any individual stocks.  “The responsible thing to do is to spread your bets out. And one way you could do this is through the ETF world, and one of our favorite ETFs to play this theme is the travel tech ETF,” said O’Hara during the same segment.  The AWAY travel tech ETF holds stocks such as Uber, Booking and Trivago and is up 34% this quarter.  “This is a relatively new ETF. It was launched in February, so obviously it got slammed along with the entire market, the ETF was cut in half,” he said. “But we’re slowly starting to see trends and momentum pick up. Over the short term, it’s probably a little overbought here, so we’ll be patient. We would like to buy on a pullback, we believe $17 offers a great opportunity.”   There is one","Jun 18, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/travel-stocks-two-names-could-benefit-from-rebound-market-analysts-say.html
8,Why Good News From 3 Top Airlines Can’t Keep Their Stocks Flying Higher – 24/7 Wall St.,. . . . . Why Good News From 3 Top Airlines Can't Keep Their Stocks Flying Higher. EDITORS' PICKS.,"The comorbidity of the instant recession and COVID-19 has caused severe damage to anything tied to tourism. The airline industry previously enjoyed extremely healthy balance sheets and full planes, and demand was so strong that the airlines were able to dictate whatever terms and flying conditions they wanted. That’s all over, and now airlines had to take a government bailout and get creative about their financing. Investors sold airline stocks as if they were all doomed. Even Warren Buffett made perhaps the worse trade of his career by selling out all his billions of dollars worth of major airline stocks at substantial losses. What was impossible to ignore was just how much the major airlines rebounded from their lows in this stock market recovery and as the economic data were signaling an uptick in travel-related demand ahead. What else had become impossible to ignore was that the airline industry’s massive stock price recovery was just too much too fast, and the expectations versus reality on the return to travel spending were at a complete mismatch. Three airlines have tried to sound like they are conveying some good news for travel plans ahead, but there is a reason beyond what these companies are saying that is tempering expectations. Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL) held its annual shareholder meeting in the new virtual meeting format that has become so common. Delta expects to end this quarter with $15 billion in liquidity and it expects its $30 million cash burn per day to be near zero by the end of this year. Delta will further save cash by closing its Sky Clubs. Delta’s current load factors are in the mid-40s (percentage the planes are full) and the ticker demand they are seeing is expected to get into the 50s ahead. That may not reach profitability, but the airline is currently capped at 60% loads for social distancing. Investors chose to take a “sell the news” approach, and Delta shares were down almost 1% at $30.39 on Thursday afternoon. It did not even help that Citigroup in prior days reiterated its Buy rating and raised its target to $38 from $30. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) issued an update on Wednesday showing that it has started seeing net positive bookings in June, but the load factor in May was only about 30% and the operating revenues were down 85% to 90%.

11,Air Canada Stock: Is It Finally Time to Buy? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Air Canada Stock: Is It Finally Time to Buy?. Know these facts.,"      Ryan Vanzo | June 18, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) is a volatile stock. At the start of 2020, shares were priced at $50. Today, they’re worth just $19 apiece. But it hasn’t always been this way. For years, this company was the definition of a millionaire-maker stock. In 2012, for example, shares traded under the $1 mark. Even when including the recent plunge, long-term shareholders have made a 2,000% profit in just eight years. If you bought in 2012, a $5,000 investment would have become $100,000. Investors are hoping that the recent correction is another chance to get in on the action. Trading at a 60% discount to its former highs, Air Canada stock tops the buys lists of countless industry analysts. Yet this isn’t a risk-free bet. The coronavirus pandemic rages on, and the ultimate impact on airline stocks remains uncertain. There are some clues, however, that suggest when shares will experience a rapid turnaround. If you want to invest in beaten-down airline stocks, be sure to know and understand the following data points. Last week, we got some good news: Air Canada will survive the coronavirus pandemic. According to management, the business recently raised $1.6 billion by selling shares and issuing debt. The primary motivation was to replace the sudden and dramatic cash burn experienced during the COVID-19 downturn. The pandemic “destroyed demand and depleted cash,” noted CFO Michael Rousseau. But he believes investor appetite for the recent capital raise indicated “a strong endorsement” from the market. Of course, a difficult path remains for Air Canada. In May, it laid off 20,000 workers, more than half of its 38,000 workforce. Last quarter, the company grounded more than 200 airplanes, reducing capacity by 95%. What does the future hold? We can glean some clues from the recent investor conference call. “The past quarter was the first in 27 consecutive quarters that we did not report year-over-year operating revenue growth,” warned CEO Calin Rovinescu. “We are now living through the darkest period ever in the history of commercial aviation.” How long will this difficult period last? The news wasn’t encouraging. “It is our current expectation that it will take at least three years to recover to 2019 levels of revenue and capacity,” Rovinescu stressed. “We expect that both the overall industry and our airline will be considerably smaller for some","Jun 18, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/06/18/air-canada-stock-is-it-finally-time-to-buy/

13,"How COVID-19 Is Changing the Airline Industry | Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland",. . SEVEN TRENDS THAT ARE RESHAPING HOW WE'LL TRAVEL. ABOUT THE EXPERT(S). SMITH PROGRAMS. SMITH PROGRAMS. ABOUT / INFO,"SMITH BRAIN TRUST – There’s no question about it: Travelers just aren’t flying as much as they used to. While the number of flight passengers has increased since the lows seen in March and April, airlines don’t anticipate being able to cover flight costs over the coming months. Coronavirus-induced uncertainty is a big reason why. When people do fly these days, they’re waiting until the last minute to book, according to the International Air Transport Association. This hinders route-planning, further complicating the industry’s recovery. With no federal requirements – but with CDC and WHO guidance, U.S. airlines have independently adopted to varying degrees pandemic sanitation and social distancing measures. And all have adopted mandatory face covering rules from check-in through deplaning both for passengers and employees. The pandemic’s social distancing norms are tough on the industry, which is designed for and thrives on crowds of people traversing through spaces, in close proximity. Maryland Smith aviation expert Michael O. Ball leads an FAA-funded consortium (NEXTOR) of eight universities dedicated to aviation operations research. “Obviously COVID-19 already has had a huge impact on aviation,” says Ball. “The pandemic will result in some fundamental changes to air transportation.” He says the pandemic’s upheaval and the industry’s path forward will be a key focus for the consortium’s research. Here are some of the big trends facing the airline industry and its passengers now. RIP middle seat? “The big question is whether the airlines will enforce social distancing onboard, by not filling middle seats,” says Roland Rust, Distinguished University Professor and David Bruce Smith Chair in Marketing at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business. “My guess, unfortunately, is that when push comes to shove, many airlines will decide that their profits are more important than passenger safety and will seek to pack people in like before. This is less of an issue now, while planes are less full, but as people tire of social distancing, the planes may fill up again, before it really is safe.” It’s impossible to accommodate social distancing without dramatically reducing capacity on flights, he adds, and if airlines try, government regulators could step in. Arriving (really) early for your flight: The previous guidance on arriving for domestic flights one hour early and international flights three hours early might soon be out the window. In airports, check-in and security processes will need to be redesigned to permit","Jun 18, 2020",https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty-research/smithbraintrust/insights/how-covid-19-changing-airline-industry-0

17,Delta Air expects to break even around spring of next year,Delta Air expects to break even around spring of next year. International service,"Delta Air Lines Inc., bleeding cash because of the COVID-19 pandemic, expects to break even by next spring as rising demand prompts the carrier to continue restoring flights, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said. “We are in the process of recovery, there’s no doubt about it,” Bastian said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. “There are clear signs the momentum we have is meaningful and continuing to build.” The Atlanta-based airline plans to add around 1,000 flights a day to its schedule in July and again in August, he said. Carriers worldwide have been pummeled by a collapse in demand from the novel coronavirus and travel restrictions to help contain its spread. U.S. airlines that had slashed flying have begun to put more planes in the sky as states lift stay-at-home orders and other limits on activity. Delta expects to operate about 30% of its year-earlier flying schedule by the end of September. “We’re at 15% of revenues today and we hope to get to 30% over the next two or three months, keeping costs at that 50% level,” Bastian said in the interview, with David Westin. “I would imagine by the spring next year, we’d be at a point where we’re breakeven.” Delta dropped 2.6% to $29.93 at 9:35 a.m. in New York as stocks fell broadly on concerns over new outbreaks of the virus in China and the U.S. The carrier’s shares had tumbled 47% this year through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 declined 3.6%. The U.S. Labor Day holiday in early September will be “an important milestone and pivot point” because it’s typically when business travel starts to build after summer, Bastian said. Many companies continue to restrict travel, a crucial component in airline profits. “That will be the next stage of recovery,” he said. The outlook is not as promising for international operations, which have largely been suspended as some countries extend travel restrictions and require 14-day quarantines for arriving passengers. International travel will lag behind the U.S. domestic recovery by as much as 12 months, Bastian said at the company’s annual meeting later Thursday. Delta is on track to burn about $30 million in cash daily this month, better than its target of reducing the figure to $40 million from $100 million earlier in the pandemic, Bastian said. He expects to reach zero by year-end.
