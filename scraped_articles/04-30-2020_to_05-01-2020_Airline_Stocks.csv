0,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. United joins the parade of carriers posting massive first-quarter losses.. What happened. So what.,"   Airline shares were under pressure Friday following United Airlines Holdings' (NASDAQ:UAL) first-quarter earnings release, providing fresh evidence of the damage done to the industry by the COVID-19 pandemic. Shares of United and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) led the sector lower on Friday, each down 7% apiece. Shares of other carriers, including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) were all also down more than 5%. The stocks clawed back some of their initial declines as the morning continued, but it appears it is going to be another difficult day for airline stocks. After markets closed Thursday, United reported an adjusted loss of $2.57 per share on revenue of $7.98 billion, compared to analyst expectations of a $3.47-per-share loss on revenue of $8.22 billion. Revenue was down 16.8% year over year, and the company's operating margin fell to -12.2% from 5.2% in the first quarter of 2019. Investors knew going into earnings season that the first quarter would be bad for airlines and the second quarter would be worse. United was hit particularly hard in the early days of the pandemic because it has the most exposure to Asia among any carrier based in the mainland U.S. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. ""We have been at the forefront of warning how deep of an impact we expect this crisis could have and how long we expect it could last,"" CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement. ""While we are still in the midst of this crisis, we will not hesitate to make difficult decisions we believe will ensure the long-term success of our company."" United's total liquidity as of close of business April 29 was $9.6 billion, including $2 billion in undrawn funds under its revolving credit facility. The airline said it expects to burn though about $40 million to $45 million in cash per day in the second quarter. The question for now is how long travel demand, and with it airline revenue, will remain depressed. The industry has billions in liquidity and access to additional funds, but no amount of capital will be enough if traffic does not return in the months to come. Delta appears likely to have the resources to survive, and United seems pretty well positioned for an extended downturn, but at least one Wall Street analyst","May 1, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/01/why-airline-shares-are-falling-today.aspx
1,Stock Market Wrap-Up: Big Investors Are Betting on Airlines. Should You? | The Motley Fool,Stock Market Wrap-Up: Big Investors Are Betting on Airlines. Should You?. The stock market gave up ground along with the,"   The stock market gave up ground on Thursday, but that wasn't enough to take away from what was an amazingly positive month for stocks in April. Even with the day's declines, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) finished the month with a gain of more than 2,400 points, or 11%. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) posted even larger gains of 13% and 15%, respectively, reflecting the optimism that investors have adopted by looking at the market's future. Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow (1.17%) (288) S&P 500 (0.92%) (27) Nasdaq Composite (0.28%) (25) DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. Airlines, in general, saw even bigger losses today than the broader market. Yet they've continued to draw interest from investors, and that's helped them raise capital that might prove crucial in weathering the difficult conditions they'll likely face for months to come. Today's performance for airlines was generally poor. Major players Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) all posted 5% losses on the day. JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) took 4% hits. Only Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) managed to gain ground, picking up 1% on the day. However, we've continued to see interest from institutional investors trying to pick up good deals in working with airlines. Today, Delta raised $3.5 billion from selling five-year notes, more than doubling the initial size of the offering from $1.5 billion. Participants in the private offering were happy to buy the secured notes, which don't offer any equity conversion rights but do include collateral in the form of various route slots, airport leases, and international flight-operation rights. An interest rate of 7% was certainly an enticing kicker for bond investors. IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. Delta's experience follows Southwest's move earlier this week to raise capital on its own. Southwest also boosted the size of its offerings, ending up raising $4 billion. Half of the money came from a secondary stock offering, while the other $2 billion came from convertible five-year notes paying 1.25% and offering conversion at a price about 35% higher than the stock price. The need for liquidity is obvious, and American made it even clearer with its quarterly results. The airline posted a first-quarter loss of $2.2 billion and says it's burning about $70 million on cash every day so far in the second quarter because of the","Apr 30, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/30/stock-market-wrap-up-big-investors-are-betting-on.aspx

7,United Airlines Earnings: Should You Buy UAL Stock in May? | InvestorPlace,United Airlines Earnings: Should You Buy UAL Stock in May?. UAL stock may come under pressure following the recent release," United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) announced Q1 earnings on Apr. 30 after market close. Management also discussed them with investors the next morning. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant a scary fallout for travel and airline stocks. Year-to-date, UAL stock is down about 66%.  Yet that price decline shows only half the story. In recent weeks, markets have been rising on days we get optimistic headlines regarding the potential end of the lockdown. UAL shares have also gone up. On March 18, they hit a multi-year low of $17.80. Now they are hovering around $29. That is an increase of over 60%. So should you commit new capital to the airline? I believe any potential short-term recovery has already been priced into UAL stock. Therefore if you are not yet a shareholder, you may want to wait for a pullback in the shares. Here’s why. The past several weeks must have been among the most challenging in United’s recent history. On Apr. 15, Oscar Munoz, Chief Executive Officer, and J. Scott Kirby, President, issued a joint statement saying “The challenge that lies ahead for United is bigger than any we have faced in our proud 94-year history. We are committed to being as direct and as transparent as possible with you.” The Chicago-based carrier has just released its first-quarter results with a net loss of $1.7 billion, diluted loss per share of $6.86, and pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion. Mr. Munoz’s solemn words in the earnings statement possibly sum up the mood for the industry in general: “While we are still in the midst of this crisis, we will not hesitate to make difficult decisions we believe will ensure the long term success of our company.” By comparison, in late January, when the airline released Q4 results, its earnings of $2.67 per share had beaten estimates. United’s profits had surged close to 40% on cheaper fuel and strong demand. The group also announced net income of $614 million in the fourth-quarter, up 39% from the year-earlier period on revenues of $10.89 billion. The revenue had also been about 4% higher than a year earlier. Put another way, it is easy to see the adverse effect of the coronavirus-induced uncertainty on UAL earnings. My main takeaway from United’s quarterly results and the conference call is that life will not be the same for at least some more time to come. Could airlines’","May 1, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/05/united-airlines-earnings-should-you-buy-ual-stock-in-may/

Air Canada (TSX:AC) Is a Buy for TFSA Investors Before it Returns,"      Joey Frenette | April 30, 2020 | More on: AC Every once in a while, Mr. Market offers a deal that’s too good for TFSA investors to pass up, such as Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock at today’s depressed levels. The insidious coronavirus (COVID-19) caused shares of the top Canadian airline to get cut in half twice, with shares falling over 75% from the February peak to the March trough. The airlines are at ground zero of the coronavirus-induced lockdown, and the uncertainties couldn’t be greater. However, I think that many TFSA investors have become too nearsighted with Air Canada stock. More folks seemingly focused on the firm’s risk of bankruptcy (which I view as highly unlikely) rather than how high the airline will fly in 2021 and beyond, once the coronavirus pandemic finally falls in the rear-view mirror. Sure, the airline is due to suffer an unprecedented decline to its top- and bottom-line numbers for the coming quarters, but that’s probably already baked into the stock and then some. And while some may fear that Air Canada won’t survive the coronavirus crisis, I’m in the viewpoint that the company as “too vital to fail.” Even under the assumption that the pandemic drags on through 2020, with a potential spillover into 2021, Air Canada stock is still so ridiculously cheap that it’s priced to outperform, even if the re-opening of the global economy were to take longer than expected. In any case, Air Canada has made all the right moves to navigate the rough waters that lie ahead. Capacity cuts, minimal debt coming due amid the pandemic, and a decent liquidity position make Air Canada stock less of a speculative gamble relative to its U.S.-based counterparts and more of a deep-value investment that’s a top pick for TFSA investors. Yes, the stock is risky, and off-the-charts volatility will likely continue to be the theme for the troubled airline stocks. Still, the potential rewards over the medium term have the potential to be profound, given the excessive pessimism surrounding the airlines. Boeing CEO David Calhoun believes that air travel could take two to three years to recover. For a long-term investor with a time horizon that should be at least five years, a two- to three-year recovery is nothing in the grander scheme of things.

What we covered here. . Constellation","By CNN Business   Our live coverage has ended. You can follow the latest on the stock market here.  By Alicia Wallace Constellation Brands is increasing its ownership stake in the world’s largest cannabis company by market capitalization. The alcohol company, a subsidiary of Constellation, which distributes such brands like as Corona beer in North America, infused $245 million in Canopy Growth by exercising 18.9 million warrants, the companies announced Friday. The purchase represented a 5.1% share Canopy Growth, and Constellation now owns a 38.6% stake in the Canadian cannabis company.  ""While global legalization of cannabis is still in its infancy, we continue to believe the long-term opportunity in this evolving market is substantial,"" Bill Newlands, Constellation’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. The transaction comes at a time when Canopy Growth is drastically cutting costs by exiting countries entirely, closing down greenhouses, and laying off more than 750 employees since the beginning of March. From CNN Business' Paul R. La Monica The market fell sharply Friday, erasing Wall Street's gains for the week. Concerns about increased tension between President Trump and China due to the Covid-19 pandemic weighed on stocks. A weak reading on manufacturing in the United States also hurt investor sentiment. Amazon (AMZN) shares plunged after the company posted weaker-than-expected-earnings while Tesla (TSLA) fell after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he thought the electric carmaker's stock price was too high. From CNN Business' Chris Isidore   Southwest Airlines announced Friday it sold 80.5 million shares to raise $2.3 billion, the latest move by a US airline to stockpile cash to get through the current crisis. On Tuesday, the airline reported a loss of $77 billion, excluding special items, the first time it has lost money on that basis in 11 years. And it warned that it expects to burn through $30 million to $35 million a day in the current quarter. Southwest had about $6.8 billion in cash on hand as of April 24, and will receive $1.6 billion in support from the Treasury Department as part of the industry bailout. Southwest had previously drawn down $3.3 billion in cash available from a previously arranged credit line. It has also raised almost $500 million from a bond offering. But raising cash through an additional stock offering is an unusual move, although United Airlines did so last month when it sold $1 billion","May 1, 2020",https://edition.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-news-050120/index.html

stock has created an attractive entry point into a company that will “undoubtedly” exit the current crisis in a stronger position than it had entered, according to Stifel. Joseph DeNardi upgraded Southwest Airlines from Hold to Buy, raising the price target from $40 to $50. Southwest Airlines is building a “liquidity war chest,” which should drive earnings power as the market recovers and allow the company to “play offensive” when some of its peers are unable to do the same, DeNardi said in the note. He added that although the capital raising has caused near-term dilution, the market seems to be underappreciating the returns Southwest Airlines can generate from the capital it has raised. ★★★★★

There is high uncertainty around the pace of demand recovery, but DeNardi said air travel has historically been more resilient than most other sections. He mentioned the crisis will offer consolidation opportunities, which will boost airline earnings power in the longer term. Airline earnings power will also increase with higher barriers to entry. “We believe Southwest's financial capacity, balance sheet strength, capex flexibility, strong brand, and diverse network position it well to emerge competitively stronger with improved earnings power on the other side of the COVID-19 crisis,” DeNardi wrote. Shares of Southwest Airlines had risen almost 1% to $31.16 at time of publication Thursday. View More Analyst Ratings for LUV

19,Coronavirus: How does Warren Buffett feel about Covid-19 crisis?,Coronavirus: How does Warren Buffett feel about Covid-19 crisis?. . ,"Warren Buffett is about to share his views for the first time since the crisis began. Is he still bullish on America? Warren Buffett will address his followers on Saturday for the first time since the US began implementing the state-by-state lockdowns that have upended the economy and life as we knew it. Technically, it’s the annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholder meeting, though much will be missing from this year’s event — people, for starters. Even so, the main draw of the weekend lives on: the chance to pick one of the most brilliant brains in business. In a live-streamed interview that evening, Buffett will answer questions submitted by investors, including presumably how the conglomerate’s various lines of business have been affected by the pandemic. But what listeners are really tuning in for are the Oracle of Omaha’s broader views on the world during a time like this. Here are five questions for him: 1. Is it time to name a successor? Or has he essentially done so? For the first time, Buffett is doing the Q&A jointly with Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman, rather than his usual sidekick, Charlie Munger, who is 96 years old and resides in California. Buffett, who will turn 90 in August, even joked in his February letter to shareholders that he and Munger are in “the urgent zone."" All signs point to Abel being the next CEO of Berkshire, but Buffett hasn’t spelled out the succession plan yet. It was going to be hard enough for shareholders to get comfortable with anyone other than him someday being the steward of their money. With all the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, now is a good time for Buffett to clarify why Abel is best suited to manage the conglomerate, even through a crisis like this. 2. Could the concept of a “new normal"" alter what kinds of investments Berkshire makes in the future? If Buffett isn’t using his enforced isolation at home to hunt for another elephant-sized acquisition, is that because the Covid-19 shutdowns are causing him to reevaluate what types of businesses will recover? Or is he perhaps grappling with the potential for long-term changes in customer behavior? Taking a stake in the Kroger Co. supermarket chain late last year proved to be prescient; buying preferred stock in oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp. not so much. Those circumstances would still seem to be","May 1, 2020",https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/coronavirus-how-does-warren-buffett-feel-about-covid-19-crisis-11588335744895.html
