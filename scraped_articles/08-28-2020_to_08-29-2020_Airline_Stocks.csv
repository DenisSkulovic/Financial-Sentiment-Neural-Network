0,Airline Stocks: Buy or Sell?,. . . . . . . . Airline Stocks: Buy or Sell?. The smallest airline. The powerful cargo stock.,"      Adam Othman | August 28, 2020 | More on: CHR CJT While the year 2020 has been a disastrous one for the stock market, few sectors have suffered as much as airlines, hospitality, and tourism. As per Canadian airlines, one of the reasons why they are suffering more than some of their international counterparts is because of government’s stringent travel restrictions that’s especially choking off international travel. The country’s premier airline is suffering the most from the lack of international travel, but it’s just as bad for the two other airlines. The picture changes drastically when we look toward cargo. Where the passenger-centric business is plummeting, cargo-related businesses are soaring to new highs. So when some airline stocks are hitting rock bottom, and one is skyrocketing, is it time to buy or sell them? Chorus Aviation (TSX:CHR) is a holding company and a global provider of regional airline solutions. In Canada, Chorus owns Jazz and Voyager Aviation, one of which flies directly under Air Canada. Whether these long-term contracts with the country’s number one airline or the situation of the airline sector around the globe is the number one reason behind Chorus’s stock valuation is hard to say. Still, whatever the reason, Chorus is in bad shape. The company is currently trading at $2.4 per share at writing — about 70% down from its pre-pandemic valuation. The dividends, once an important reason for choosing it before other airline stocks, have been suspended since April. It also had to lay off much of its staff just to keep operational. While the second-quarter earnings of Chorus aren’t as bad as they could be, given the sector’s situation, they aren’t very encouraging either. While capital appreciation was never a strong trait of Chorus stock, with earnings where they are now, it’s highly unlikely that investors might see dividends resuming anytime soon. So despite the low (and very attractive) valuation right now, Chorus is not a good buy. If you already have it in your portfolio, selling it at the current price would be a mistake. Because if there’s even a remote chance that the stock would reclaim its valuation or crosses $5 per share mark in a couple of years, holding on to it might be better for your portfolio. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Cargojet (TSX:CJT), one of the most potent growth stocks","Aug 28, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/28/airline-stocks-buy-or-sell/
1,Warren Buffett Was Right to Sell This Stock - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Warren Buffett Was Right to Sell This Stock. Buffett: Airline suffers from,"      Puja Tayal | August 28, 2020 | More on: ENB AC U.S. President Donald Trump once doubted Warren Buffett’s decision to sell his airline stocks worth $6 billion after the March market crash. I agree that Buffett has made many mistakes in his 65+ years in the stock market, but selling airline stocks ain’t one of them. At the time of crisis, only the fundamentally strong companies survive. But the magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis was beyond fundamentals. The pandemic disrupted international air travel. No airline was left behind. Under such circumstances, it comes as no surprise that airline stocks lost more than 60% of their value. Buffett has avoided airline stocks for a long time as it suffers the same pitfalls of a capital-intensive business. He had burnt his hands back in 1962, when he invested in the loss-making textile company Berkshire Hathaway. After injecting significant capital, restructuring, downsizing, and losing an estimated US$200 billion in 20 years, Buffett called it his big mistake. (He later converted it into a reinsurance company.) Like textiles, airlines need substantial capital to produce commoditized services that are sold at competitive prices. Both industries suffer from capacity issues because they have high fixed costs. For instance, Air Canada (TSX:AC) spends 90% of its revenue on operating expenses. Its 50% operating cost is fixed, such as maintenance of fleet, salaries, and airport charges. It earns a profit when it runs at full capacity and beaks even at 75-80% capacity. The COVID-19 pandemic has slashed 90% of AC’s capacity, which has made fixed costs a burden. International travel restriction is something beyond the airline’s control. There is no clarity on when these restrictions will ease. Also, there is no clarity on when would air travel demand return amid the coronavirus scare. The most optimistic bet is three years. The airline industry is expecting three years for international travel to recover to the pre-pandemic level. But with the three-month U.S.-Canada border restriction extended to six months, the recovery will take much more time. When capacity becomes a liability instead of an asset, companies downsize. AC and other airlines are doing just that. Operating at 10-20% capacity is a nightmare. Even when travel demand resumes, AC won’t operate at 70-80% capacity. Hence, it is wise to reduce capacity as per the demand. AC is reducing its fleet size by a third,","Aug 28, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/28/warren-buffett-was-right-to-sell-this-stock/

Investors continue to pour capital into","   The S&P 500 Index (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) gained another 23 points, or 0.67%, on Friday, closing the last week of August 3.2% higher than it started. That was the best week of the month, and barring a collapse on Monday, would make August the best month for stocks since May.  Today's big gains came after the Department of Commerce said that an important measure of personal consumer spending increased 1.9% on a seasonally adjusted basis in July. INVESTORS HAVE BEEN BULLISH ON TRAVEL AND HOSPITALITY STOCKS LATELY. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. On this news, along with continued momentum from Thursday's big news that the Food and Drug Administration had approved a 15-minute COVID-19 test costing $5, investors continued to buy shares of companies seen as being big beneficiaries of fast, cheap testing. These include cruise stocks, airline stocks, and casino and hotel stocks. Leading the charge today was Carnival (NYSE:CCL) with shares up almost 7%; along with Wynn Resorts and Alaska Air, up nearly 6%; and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) and Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), up more than 4%.  Today's big move higher for the stocks above, along with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) (which gained almost 4% today), is a continuation of a huge month. Here is how August played out for some of the best performers from these laggards in the consumer discretionary sector:   ^SPX DATA BY YCHARTS. The big gains have been spurred by a few positive economic data points, including the increased consumer spending post-lockdown, as well as improvements in airport traffic from the lows in April.  Add in the prospects of a rapid, cheap coronavirus test that doesn't have to go to a lab to be processed, and investors are piling into businesses that have seen their biggest downturns since March, but could see big gains once they're able to return to business as usual.  Prospects for these businesses may not be as rosy as investors expect, however. MGM just announced that it was laying off 18,000 workers, while United Airlines Holdings, American Airlines Group, and Delta could cut well over 50,000 workers combined, barring federal aid that requires them to keep those employees on payroll.

6,"Doug Parker's Compensation, Stock Sales | One Mile at a Time","Fascinating: Doug Parker’s Compensation, Stock Sales. Parker has had an incredible career. Wow: Parker’s compensation over the years. Bottom line.","Travel in the Time of COVID: The news, resources, & information you need Controversial (and I’d argue excessive) executive compensation at publicly traded US companies is nothing new. Specific to the airline industry, Epsilon Theory has a fascinating look at the compensation of Doug Parker, who is American Airlines’ CEO. The story is titled “Sacrifice for Thee, Vast Wealth for Me,” and ouch it stings. This comes at a time when American Airlines plans to lay off tens of thousands of employees if taxpayers aren’t willing to give the airline billions more dollars. I’m writing about this not because his compensation is that out of line for the industry, but rather because it’s just a fascinating look at how much money he has made, and how well timed his stock sales have been. Let’s start on a positive note. We have to give Parker credit for the fact that he has been in the airline industry his entire career, and he was an airline CEO through two mergers. First he was CEO of America West, then he became CEO of US Airways (when the two airlines merged), and then he became CEO of American Airlines (when the two airlines merged). He has gone from being CEO of a fairly small airline based in Phoenix, to CEO of the world’s largest airline. I also have to say that to me, Parker comes across as a decent guy. I’m not talking about the job he has done running the airline, but to me he has consistently come across as one of the most humble and down to earth US airline CEOs. That’s just my perspective, and I’ll acknowledge I could be completely wrong. While we know that airline CEOs regularly make eight figures a year (largely in the form of stock options), there are some things that make Parker’s compensation especially interesting, including how well timed his stock sales have been. How has Parker done since American and US Airways merged in 2013? Compensation is one thing, but what’s perhaps even more interesting is the timing of how Parker has sold shares: Parker was smart to sell his American Airlines stocks when they hit $50+. But keep in mind that when the stock was in the high $40s, Parker said that the “stock is so undervalued it defies logic.” Yet that number was also when he sold the most stocks he had","Aug 28, 2020",https://onemileatatime.com/doug-parker-compensation/

Overall, traders reacted differently during the three selected events. The strongest overreaction was noted in the post-event periods of the World Health Organization's and President Trump's official announcements. Moreover, the findings confirm that traders in western countries are more responsive to recent information than those in Asian countries.

Leave","   Wishpond begins trading BBTV sees Insider Buying Is Burcon Nutrascience still cheap?      It may not look it but Air Canada (Air Canada Stock Quote, Chart, News TSX:AC) is a stock to own for a COVID-19 recovery, says Stan Wong of Scotia Wealth Management, who says the stock is just one good vaccine away from shooting up the charts. The air travel sector has been decimated by the pandemic and associated lockdowns and restrictions, with Air Canada being no exception. The company lost $1.75 billion in its most recent quarter as revenue fell by 89 per cent to $527 million for its second quarter ended June 30. The company said it carried less than four per cent of the passengers it had during last year’s Q2, with president and CEO Calin Rovinescu calling the combined impact of COVID-19 and Canada’s federal and inter-provincial restrictions “devastating and unprecedented.” The pandemic has done a number on Air Canada’s share price which like the other airlines has refused to gain back much of the ground lost in the general market pullback of February and March. At its worst, AC went from $52 per share early in the year to as low as $12, with the stock trading in the $15 to $20 range in recent months. But investors should be thinking about dipping a toe in this stock, says Wong, director of wealth management at Scotia Wealth, who spoke on BNN Bloomberg on Wednesday. “I still like Air Canada and we still hold in the portfolio,” Wong said. “I think in the travel leisure airline space we have to be very patient with this. If you look at the share since March, whether it be Air Canada or the cruise lines or the other airlines in the States or the casino companies, they are slowly moving forward and they started to move higher.”  “With Air Canada in particular, they've got lots of liquidity in place to keep it going. When you look at what's happening and we look 12 to 18 months out, I think more people will be in the air and more people will be flying. We'll start with more domestic flights and then it's going to go more to the US and International,” he said.

15,Price to Free Cash Flow Definition,Price to Free Cash Flow. What is Price to Free Cash Flow?. KEY TAKEAWAYS. Understanding Price to Free Cash Flow.,"Price to free cash flow is an equity valuation metric used to compare a company's per-share market price to its per-share amount of free cash flow (FCF). This metric is very similar to the valuation metric of price to cash flow but is considered a more exact measure, owing to the fact that it uses free cash flow, which subtracts capital expenditures (CAPEX) from a company's total operating cash flow, thereby reflecting the actual cash flow available to fund non-asset-related growth. Companies use this metric when they need to expand their asset bases either in order to grow their businesses or simply to maintain acceptable levels of free cash flow. \begin{aligned} &\text{Price to FCF} = \frac { \text{Market Capitalization} }{ \text{Free Cash Flow} } \\ \end{aligned}
Price to FCF=
Free Cash Flow
Market Capitalization A company's free cash flow is important because it is a basic indicator of its ability to generate additional revenues, which is a crucial element in stock pricing. The price to free cash flow metric is calculated as follows: Price to free cash flow = market capitalization value / total free cash flow amount For example, a company with $100 million in total operating cash flow and $50 million in capital expenditures has a free cash flow total of $50 million. If the company's market cap value is $1 billion, then the company's stock trades at 20 times free cash flow - $1 billion / $50 million. Because price to free cash flow is a value metric, lower numbers generally indicate that a company is undervalued and its stock is relatively cheap in relation to its free cash flow. Conversely, higher price to free cash flow numbers may indicate that the company's stock is relatively overvalued in relation to its free cash flow. Therefore, value investors favor companies with low or decreasing price to free cash flow values that indicate high or increasing free cash flow totals and relatively low stock share prices. They tend to avoid companies with high price to free cash flow values that indicate the company's share price is relatively high compared to its free cash flow. In short, the lower the price to free cash flow, the more a company's stock is considered to be a better bargain or value. As with any equity evaluation metric, it is most useful to compare a company's price to free cash ratio to that of other similar","Aug 28, 2020",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetofreecashflow.asp

BTC-USD.,"                                                   This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com. By Justin Spittler By now, everyone knows that COVID-19 all but shut down the airline industry. Airline share prices fell off a cliff. Major carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta (DAL) lost half their value in just a few weeks. But most people don’t know about the chaos that unfolded behind the scenes. According to consulting firm Forrester, one major airline received more than 120,000 cancellation requests during the first few weeks of the pandemic. As you can imagine, this is a nightmare to deal with. Each request takes three to four minutes to process. So, we’re talking at least 6,000 manhours of work. Naturally, customers want their refunds fast, so time was of the essence. To deal with this flood of cancellations, the airline turned to cutting-edge technology: robotic process automation (RPA). In short, the airline built an RPA “bot” in just six days. This bot was able to address 80% of the airline’s cancellation requests, or about 4,000 per day! Most people haven’t heard of RPA. That’s because it’s relatively new. It’s also not an easy technology to invest in. But as I’ll show you, that’s going to change very soon. In a nutshell, RPA is the use of computers, or “bots,” to perform work that humans would normally perform. An RPA bot can read and understand documents, it can perform data entry, and it can process items like invoices. In other words, while artificial intelligence (AI) uses computers to think, RPA uses computers to carry out tasks. Companies love RPA because it saves them money and makes them more efficient. Robots, after all, are often cheaper than human workers. Computers also don’t make mistakes when they’re tired, distracted, or unmotivated. Employees like RPA because it means they don’t have to perform mundane tasks. Instead, they can focus on more meaningful work like interacting with customers.

The Awkward Truth About Australia’s," A savvy investment, or flat-out punt? Photo Credit: Getty Images Throwing money at the stock market is always a fraught endeavour. As one of the smartest (and most cutting) finance tweets of 2020 puts it, if you’re punting on the stock market right now, you’re either an idiot or a genius. Though this is perhaps an exaggeration, the gist is clear: if you don’t know what you’re doing, you could get yourself into hot water trading this year. That said, with many companies’ stocks now trading for pennies on the dollar, the temptation to fling a few shekels around (despite this being one of the common mistakes rookie investors are warned against), is understandably tempting. The travel industry is on its knees, with many airlines – most notably Virgin Australia – doing it particularly tough. With experts predicting a return to normal levels of globetrotting by 2024, could Virgin Australia be a dark horse 2020 investment? Online discussion forums show this is a question on many young professionals’ minds. One recent thread on Reddit‘s  /r/ausstocks, for instance, posed the question: “Is it worth investing in Virgin Australia?” “Currently, the share prices are very cheap [at] 0.055,” the author of the thread wrote in April. “Would it be worth investing a little amount of money to see if it could climb up? My reasoning for this is because it could climb up because of the bailout… any tips whether this is wrong or dumb as I am quite new. Thanks!” Of course, the situation has evolved since then. But the uncertainty around Virgin Australia’s future is far from over, with even Qantas, which has survived the devastation of the pandemic without having to go into voluntary administration, preparing for a dearth of international flights until July 2021. One commenter beneath the thread offered the following thoughts: “As of August last year, Virgin has had 7 years of losses.” “It is currently facing the worst aviation meltdown ever. It competes with a national icon that has loads more cash, a massive frequent flyer program, more routes and is profitable.” “If you need to ask about taking a position in such a stock, you should not be taking a position in that stock.
