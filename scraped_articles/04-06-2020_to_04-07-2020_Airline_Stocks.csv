2,"Buffett Pulls Back on Airline Stocks, But Don't Fret ... Yet | Kiplinger","Save up to 67%. Buffett Pulls Back on Airline Stocks, But Don't Fret ... Yet. The Oracle said he wouldn't","2007 Getty Images Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) chief Warren Buffett embraced airline stocks in a big way back in 2016, added to his holdings in February and said in March that he ""won't be selling airline stocks"" even as the industry reeled under the coronavirus-led collapse in air travel. And then Warren Buffett up and sold some airline stocks. On Friday, April 3, investors learned through regulatory disclosures that Berkshire had ditched 13 million shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL, $22.48) and 2.3 million shares of Southwest Airlines (LUV, $30.54). This revelation came earlier than the mid-May release of Berkshire's Form 13F because the firm held 10%-plus stakes in Delta and Southwest, mandating Buffett's holding company immediately disclose any material changes to those positions. Berkshire also owns stakes in United Airlines (UAL, $22.89) and American Airlines (AAL, $9.39), but because those stakes are less than 10%, we likely won't find out about any moves in those holdings until the May 13F release. Berkshire cut its DAL holdings by 18%. That's a substantial pullback but hardly a full-scale dumping. Berkshire's remaining stake of almost 59 million shares was worth about $1.3 billion as of April 3. And, importantly, BRK.B remains Delta's largest shareholder with 9.2% of the company's shares outstanding. It's possible that Buffett pared the DAL stake only to get below the 10% ownership threshold that would trigger regulatory headaches, but neither he nor anyone else from Berkshire has commented on the sale. As for LUV, Berkshire pared its stake by just 4%. The holding company still owns more than 51 million shares worth about $1.6 billion. And BRK.B remains Southwest's largest shareholder with 9.9% of the airline's shares outstanding. Again, it's possible Berkshire trimmed its LUV stake to stay on the right side of the 10% ownership threshold. It's understandable if the Delta divestiture in particular left some investors scratching their heads. As recently as late February, Berkshire bought another 976,507 Delta shares. And then in an interview with Yahoo Finance on March 13, Buffett stated categorically, ""I won't be selling airline stocks."" But then he did. Buffett made no comment as to why he sold, which is typical, as he rarely comments on changes to Berkshire's portfolio. It's true that much has changed in the weeks since Buffett said he was standing pat. DAL stock has tumbled 41% since March 13 and is down 62% since the bull market","Apr 7, 2020",https://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/t052-c008-s001-buffett-pulls-back-on-airline-stocks-but-dont-fret.html
3,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Sells Airline Stocks Worth Nearly $400 M,". Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sells airline stocks worth nearly $400 m. On Feb 27, Buffett's company had scooped up","                                           Billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold $314 million worth of shares of Delta Air Lines and divested about 4 percent of its stake in Southwest Airlines, according to US Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Berkshire Hathaway sold 13 million shares (18 percent of its stake) of Delta Airlines on March 11 and 12 priced between $22.96 and $26.04 apiece. “Delta is burning more than $60 million in cash every day, we know we still haven’t seen the bottom,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian wrote in a memo to employees. “Without the self-help actions we are taking to save costs and raise new financing, that money would be gone by June.” On Feb 27, Buffett's company had scooped up nearly one million shares of Delta Air Lines at $46.40 apiece, taking its total holding to about 71.9 million shares, or about 11.2 percent, of the company. Separately, the company dumped about 2.3 million shares of Southwest Airlines for about $74 million. The aviation sector has been one of the worst-hit from the COVID-19 pandemic as several major airlines were forced into hiatus due to lockdowns around the globe.

4,Warren Buffett Sells Airline Stocks in An Abrupt Reversal: What Does It Say About the Coronavirus Bear Market? | The Motley Fool,Warren Buffett Sells Airline Stocks in An Abrupt Reversal: What Does It Say About the Coronavirus Bear Market?. The Oracle,"   Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) has gone from buyer to seller on airline stocks, selling nearly 13 million shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and 2.3 million shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) in recent days. Airline stocks have been among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic-related sell-off, with shares of Delta and Southwest down 52% and 36%, respectively, in the last month alone. But the sale by Warren Buffett's Berkshire is still surprising, considering the company was buying Delta shares just one month ago. Berkshire Hathaway had to disclose the sales because it owned more than 10% of each airline. We won't know until May whether Berkshire was also selling its stake in two other airlines, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) or American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), or whether Buffett and his co-advisors intend to continue to pare their Delta and Southwest stakes in the days and weeks to come. IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL. It’s worth stating, we don't know for sure it was Buffett who pulled the trigger: He has said that he oversees three of Berkshire Hathaway's airline positions, while portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are responsible for the fourth. Truth is there is a lot we don't know about the sales, other than to say the moves are not bullish for the airlines. And they could signal how the Oracle of Omaha is thinking about the overall market as well. The airlines are high-fixed cost businesses that have seen revenue evaporate overnight. Delta on Friday said it is currently burning through more than $400 million of its cash reserve each week and expects second quarter revenue to fall 90% year over year. Southwest, meanwhile, reportedly flew more than 50 empty planes on a single day last week. The airlines are turning to the government for help, with both Delta and Southwest -- along with most of their peers -- expected to apply for some of the $50 billion in grants and loans available to the industry as part of the $2 trillion economic stimulus package passed late last month. But that money only buys more time: No airline can burn through $1.6 billion in cash per month and sustain operations indefinitely. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. The hope is that as the pandemic is eventually contained passenger traffic will come back, but that's no sure bet if the economy falls into a recession.","Apr 6, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/06/warren-buffett-sells-airline-stocks-in-an-abrupt-r.aspx

urope It has been another solid day of gains for European markets as optimism grows that Covid-19 infection and death rates have reached the peak of the crisis and are on their way back down across Europe, with the DAX and CAC40, over 20% up from their March lows. The rising optimism may well have been tempered, as we head into the close, by the news that Spain saw an increase in its death and infection rate with the release of its latest numbers, while authorities in France warned that they still expected the number of deaths and infections to continue to rise in the coming days. Nonetheless, despite today’s setback in Spain, investors appear to be looking at events through the lens of increased stimulus, and the prospect that we’re probably closer to the end of the outbreak than the beginning. Whether that proves to be correct, only time will tell, but it’s likely to be a bumpy ride along the way. A recession still remains a given; but hopes are rising that it could well be manageable and not turn into a depression, and that is boosting airlines and travel shares, a sector that has so far borne the brunt of the huge sell off since February 21st. EasyJet and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines are leading the gainers in the airline sector, with EasyJet up close to 20% though these gains need to be set in the context of declines in excess of 50% since late February. The hotel sector has also risen today, in lockstep with the airlines, with French hotel chain rallying even as it announced that it would laying off 220k of its 300k staff as it struggles to maintain its cash position over the timeframe of the pandemic. CEO Sebastien Bazin insisted that he fully intends to rehire all of them once the crisis is over, as well as reopening every closed hotel. Accor also said they would be setting up a fund from 25% of its planned dividend to set up a special purpose vehicle to assist its employees while they are furloughed.

12,Airline stocks are struggling and the crisis is far from over | Currency.com,Airline stocks are struggling and the crisis is far from over. Airline stocks news. Are there any good airline stocks,"  Airline stocks, such as Delta, United and American Airlines, have been disproportionately hit because of the coronavirus pandemic, and hopes of a quick recovery are beginning to fade It’s official: the last quarter saw the Dow Jones and the FTSE 100 suffer their biggest losses in more than 35 years. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the economy in ways that were previously unimaginable. In the United States, more than 6.6 million people sought unemployment benefits in the final week of March. Before the crisis began, the record number of jobless claims had stood at 695,000, and that was set in 1982. Unsurprisingly, airline stocks have been worst affected by the bloodbath. Travel restrictions brought about by the coronavirus have caused bookings to collapse and planes to be grounded. Industry giants are requesting government bailouts if they are to have any chance of survival. Worse still, there’s no end in sight – and air travel might not return to normal for several months. Even if some companies begin to recover, airline shares may be down in the dumps for a while. Here are some fast facts about what airline stocks are dealing with. United Airlines says that it is losing more than $100m in sales on a daily basis – a figure that could deepen as coronavirus cases increase in the US. United is already cutting services during the crucial summer season to the bone, even though it is several months away. The embattled company will only be operating with 40 per cent of its international capacity, and the launch of new routes has been suspended. 0'>United is definitely one of the airline stocks to watch. The company’s president, Scott Kirby, has been forthright about the challenges that lie ahead. He had previously predicted that airline shares like his own could rebound quite quickly when the number of new COVID-19 cases began to subside – much like the recovery staged following SARS and MERS – but he now believes it will take a lot longer for things to return to normal. Collectively, airline stocks in the three biggest carriers in the US have plunged by more than 55 per cent year to date. Delta has a market cap of $14.52bn at the time of writing, while United's stands at $5.46bn and 0'>American Airlines at $4.29bn. Add this altogether and you get $24.3bn.

14,1 Top Airline Stock to Buy in the 2020 Market Crash - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . 1 Top Airline Stock to Buy in the 2020 Market Crash. Buy,"      Matt Smith | April 6, 2020 | More on: AC The latest market crash and bear market has created one of the best opportunities in a decade to build wealth. The leading Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost a whopping 26% since the start of 2020. The S&P/TSX Composite has followed it lower, plunging by 24% to see the index at its lowest point since 2016. The coronavirus pandemic is expected to have a sharp impact on the global economy. Even interest rate cuts and significant fiscal stimulus will do little to breathe life into the economy over the short term. Governments have introduced restrictions on movement, travel bans, and forced all but providers of essential services to close. Unsurprisingly, many investors are in shock over the market losing in a month what took four years to gain. Many businesses will require government bailouts if they are to survive what some economists are tipping will be the worst recession since the Great Depression. While there is worse ahead for stocks, it shouldn’t prevent you from taking the opportunity to buy quality stocks at what are bargain-basement prices. Among the worst-performing Canadian stocks is Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B), which has lost 69% since the start of 2020. During the 2008 financial crisis, when international credit markets seized up, triggering the worst economic slump since the Great Depression, Air Canada plunged to below $1 per share. Canada’s national flag carrier almost had to declare bankruptcy. Had you bought Air Canada at the end of the last bear market in 2010, by the end of 2019, you would have earned a massive 2,085%. This highlights that Air Canada’s stock grew 22-fold in value over that period, meaning that a $10,000 investment in 2010 would’ve been worth $218,557 at the end of 2019. The latest decline in Air Canada’s stock has created a similar opportunity, although it is important to recognize that the airline’s value could fall further. It will be some time before air travel returns to normal. The coronavirus pandemic has forced governments to close their borders and implement travel bans to prevent the spread of the virus. The pandemic has created an apprehension of travelling, particularly by air. It will be some time before tourism and airline travel returns to normal. The fallout for airlines, hotels, and restaurants will be far worse than the last major","Apr 6, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/06/1-top-airline-stock-to-buy-in-the-2020-market-crash/

16,Airlines that need a lift in current fragile landscape | The Edge Markets,. . TRENDING NOW. Airlines that need a lift in current fragile landscape. Subscribe to Mid-day email alert. FEATURED VIDEOS,"          LAST week, Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) became the first airline to raise funds from the capital markets to help it steer through the Covid-19 crisis. The amount to be raised is a staggering S$15 billion via the issuance of new shares and bonds, with state investor Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd — the carrier’s largest shareholder — pledging to take up any unsubscribed shares and bonds. In addition, SIA has secured a S$4 billion bridge loan facility with DBS Bank. “This latest move will not only shore up the airline’s fast-depleting balance sheet, but will reassure investors and restore passenger confidence in SIA,” says Shukor Yusof, head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. “Most importantly, it ensures that SIA would be able to preserve its employees, many of whom have gone on unpaid leave.” SIA had earlier drawn on its lines of credit to meet its immediate cash flow requirements. Its cash and cash equivalents amounted to S$1.57 billion as at end-December last year while borrowings totalled S$6.83 billion. It recorded a net profit of S$520.4 million on revenue of S$12.8 billion for the nine months ended Dec 31. According to Shukor, while the airline’s balance sheet in the past has been the envy of many in the industry, SIA has expanded aggressively in recent years — buying 67 Airbus A350 jets and 39 Boeing 777-9 and 787 planes. SIA is also solely dependent on the international market, which has come to a standstill due to the spread of Covid-19. With SIA — touted as one of the world’s most prudent and profitable airlines — getting a lifeline from its government, how would its counterparts even survive? In this extraordinary time, with the collapse of ticket sales income, the survival test of airlines will essentially boil down to their financial reserves and cash flow management, an analyst at a local brokerage tells The Edge. “While some airlines have grounded planes and asked their employees to take pay cuts and no-pay leave to slash operating expenses, they would still need to service their debt and pay for other essential maintenance costs. To meet all these urgent financial obligations, airlines would then be forced to utilise their cash reserves, draw down their credit lines further and may even seek government bailouts in the worst-case scenario.” A preliminary assessment by Moody’s Investors Service indicates that","Apr 7, 2020",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/airlines-need-lift-current-fragile-landscape
