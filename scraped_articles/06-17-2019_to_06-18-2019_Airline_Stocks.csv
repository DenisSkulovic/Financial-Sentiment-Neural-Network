RECOVERY WITH THE FT Myles McCormick in London Shares in airlines across Europe fell on Monday after Lufthansa issued a profit warning, citing intense competition in the sector. The sell-off came after the Frankfurt-listed carrier cut its full-year outlook, saying its margins had come under pressure from “marketwide overcapacities” and “aggressively growing low-cost competitors”. The warning pointed to a wider malaise in the sector, analysts said. Russ Mould at AJ Bell noted the factors at play were not new and that the cut in outlook suggested “life is getting even tougher for the airlines”. Lufthansa led the fall, losing 10.8 per cent by mid-morning, making it the worst performer on both Germany’s Dax 30 and the European benchmark Stoxx 600. In London, low-cost carrier easyJet shed 5.2 per cent and was the worst performer on the FTSE 100. British Airlines parent IAG lost 2.5 per cent. Wizz dropped 3.2 per cent. Air France-KLM was down 3.2 per cent in Paris, while Ryanair was the second-worst performer on Ireland’s ISEQ index, with shares dropping 4.3 per cent. “While price cuts are fantastic news for travellers, the airline can’t sustain lossmaking operations forever,” Mr Mould said. “In addition to a price war and excess capacity across Europe, higher fuel prices and the 737 Max grounding have added to the industry pressures, making 2019 a miserable year for airlines.” In January Ryanair issued its second profit warning in four months as airfares fell over the winter period.

1,Lufthansa profit warning hurts ‘miserable’ airline stocks - CityAM : CityAM,Lufthansa profit warning hurts ‘miserable’ airline stocks. Lufthansa’s woes hurt airline sector,"A Lufthansa profit warning dragged down airline stocks this morning as analysts warned investors are “spooked”. The Frankfurt-listed flyer blamed overcapacity in the market and rival carrier competition for falling ticket prices in Europe. Read more: Flybe boss to quit after airline’s sale to Connect Airways Lowering its earnings margin forecast to between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent, Lufthansa warned investors it would only rake in €2bn to €2.4bn in profit for 2019. That compares to a previous forecast of 6.5 per and eight per cent margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), or €2.45bn to €3bn. “Yields in the European short-haul market, in particular in the Group’s home markets Germany and Austria, are affected by sustained overcapacities caused by carriers willing to accept significant losses to expand their market share,” Lufthansa said. “This is putting pressure on yields at the Network Airlines and Eurowings.”  Lufthansa shares fell 12.2 per cent in early trading today to just €15.5 per share. But the airline’s woes hit its rivals as the profit warning scared off investors already wary of widespread problems besetting an ailing sector. Easyjet dropped 4.1 per cent to 890.8p per share while British Airways owner IAG fell three per cent to 446.6p. “Shares in the airlines sector have been spooked by [Lufthansa’s] profit warning,” Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said. “These factors are certainly not ‘new’ news and so the fact Lufthansa is still moaning would suggest life is getting even tougher for the airlines.” So far this year the airline industry has seen higher fuel prices hit airlines including Ryanair, which issued a profit warning in May. Meanwhile Thomas Cook is selling its airline unit in a bid to save the holidaymaker from administration. And Flybe fell into the hands of a consortium bid led by Virgin Atlantic. Flybmi collapsed into administration in February while Easyjet’s losses rose to £275m last year, as higher fuel prices bit the airline. “Lufthansa’s Q1 loss was a red flag for the airline sector,” Neil Wilson, chief analyst at Markets.com, said. “No signs that anyone is prepared to reduce capacity therefore we would anticipate the wave of consolidation in European short haul is not over.” Since the start of 2019, IAG shares have plummeted 27 per cent, Easyjet’s are down 19 per cent, and Ryanair has fallen five per cent, according to AJ Bell.","Jun 17, 2019",https://www.cityam.com/lufthansa-profit-warning-hurts-miserable-airline-stocks/

The pan-European STOXX 600 index finished 0.1% lower. France’s CAC 40 was led higher by luxury stocks, while IT company Indra Sistemas’ 7.1% slip took Spain’s IBEX 35 0.7% lower. At the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting starting Tuesday, investors on balance think an interest rate cut is unlikely while many back a shift toward one in July. A swing in money market pricing toward up-to-three rate cuts by the Fed this year have been at the heart of a recovery for stock markets this month after their worst falls in months in May. [MKTS/GLOB] “The market seemed to be in a kind of cautious mode because of the Fed meeting. A lot has been priced in,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. “There is a much higher chance that the Fed intentionally or unintentionally pours cold water over the expectations,” he said. The European travel and leisure sector underperformed other major European sectors as Lufthansa plunged 11.6% and kept Germany’s DAX pressured. The group lowered its profit outlook for the full year 2019, citing price competition from low cost rivals in Europe. “Lufthansa signaling a weak outlook is hitting all these bigger carriers and that’s definitely one negative element this morning,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) fell 2.2%, while budget airlines EasyJet and Ryanair Holdings slipped more than 4% each. Spain’s Indra Sistemas fell after a media report said is to buy up to 75% of ITP Aero from Rolls Royce for about 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion).

It’s a mantra investors of Jet Airways (India) Ltd have held on to firmly. The airline had suspended operations more than two months ago, and attempts to find a buyer for the airline have come a cropper. However, the company’s shares are taking a long time to land. On Tuesday, after lenders finally dragged the company to the bankruptcy court, Jet’s shares fell as much as 41% in a single session. They had fallen by 31.5% on 18 April, the day after Jet announced that it is suspending operations. However, in the two months in between, Jet shares largely hovered around the ₹150 mark. At that price, Jet had a market capitalization of around ₹1,700 crore. Along with its mammoth debt, that meant an enterprise value of about ₹9,000 crore for an airline that had stopped flying, which was clearly bizarre.

5,A Look At 3 Stocks Related To Aussie Airline Industry,A Look At 3 Stocks Related To Aussie Airline Industry. Latest Videos. . . . . . . . .,"Australia Edition    Given the fact that Australia is an island and one of the booming economies of the world, the significance of air transport and the airline industry is growing. Typically, the airlines are the carriers of passengers in the country as most of the freights are carried via ships. There are five main subsectors of the Aviation industry in Australia- domestic commercial wing, international commercial wing, general aviation, air-freight transportation and aviation support infrastructure. Over the years, the government has played a vital role in executing required structural amendments, especially in the regional airline domain to bring out efficiency. Coming to recent times, according to market experts, the sector is expected to remain strong for Australian tourism and a prediction believes that by 2020, the airline capacity would increase by 50%. This seems much likely to occur as the international aviation capacity to Australia has been on a growth spree over the last few years. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau takes the onus to look after the safety shortages and aeroplane accidents in the country. Few major airports of the country are listed below: A few major players of the aviation sector that are listed on ASX are as follows: With this backdrop, let us now look at 3 other stocks listed on ASX and understand their stock performance and get to know about their recent updates: Alliance Aviation Services Limited Company Profile: A provider of the charter, contract and allied aviation services, Alliance Aviation Services Limited (ASX: AQZ) has operational bases in Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, Darwin, Townsville and Cairns.

Jet Airways share price: According to news agency","Jet Airways price: The stock has fallen 73.91% since the grounding of the airline Jet Airways shares nosedived to record lows on Tuesday, wiping out more than half of the company's market value, a day after creditors said that they plan to begin insolvency proceedings against the grounded airline. Jet Airways stock plunged as much as 53.72 per cent to a record low of ₹ 31.65 in intraday trade on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Jet shares slumped 52.78 per cent to an intraday low of ₹ 32.25 apiece. Jet Airways shares ended 40.78 per cent lower at ₹ 40.45 apiece on the BSE, and 40.79 per cent lower at Rs 40.50 on the NSE.  Investors' wealth worth ₹ 316.37 crore was wiped off on Tuesday. Jet's market capitalisation stood at ₹ 459.50 crore at Tuesday's closing price, as against ₹ 775.87 crore the previous day, according to data from the BSE. According to news agency Reuters, insolvency proceedings against Jet Airways are likely to begin this week. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) could hear insolvency petitions filed by the carrier's operational creditors for recovery of dues on June 20, the report said. Last week, the National Stock Exchange said Jet Airways shares would be pulled out of derivative trading, citing the embattled carrier's failure to respond to queries about rumours in the market. Jet securities will be moved to the trade-for-trade segment with effect from June 28 as a ""preventive surveillance measure"" from the current rolling segment which allows daily trading, the stock exchange had said.  Jet was forced to suspend all of its flight operations indefinitely on April 17 after running out of money and failing to secure funds. It is saddled with a debt pile of more than Rs 8,000 crore and owes vast sums to lessors, suppliers, pilots and oil companies. Since the grounding of the airline, Jet Airways shares have fallen 73.91 per cent as of Monday's closing price.   Jet and its lenders have been searching for new investors but have failed to agree a proposal. (With inputs from agencies) Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com.

The stock of Pegasus Hava Tasimaciligi has outperformed that of Turk Hava Yollari AO, or Turkish Airlines as the company is known, by more than 95 percentage points this year. The divergence has been amplified by bets that it stands to gain amid setbacks that have plagued its rival—Turkish Airlines is now flying primarily from the new mega airport opened 20 miles outside Istanbul city centre. The $12bn Istanbul Airport is located on the foggy Black Sea coast and local reports show it struggling against far too many diverted flights, delays and long runway taxi times, all of which threatens to erode Turkish Airlines’ earnings. Meanwhile, Pegasus is the choice for many passengers determined to steer clear of any inconvenience. By choosing Sabiha Gokcen International Airport—Istanbul’s second airport on the Asian side of the city following the closure of Ataturk Airport to commercial flights to facilitate the opening of Istanbul Airport—they can easily opt for Pegasus as that is where the bulk of its flights operate from. While the travails for Turkish Airlines are likely temporary, “Sabiha Gokcen’s strategic importance has increased,” Behlul Katas, an analyst at Yatirim Finansman, an Istanbul-based broker, reportedly said, citing the distance that passengers have to travel to reach Istanbul Airport and concerns over the costs the flag carrier needs to assume at its new hub.

CNBC Newsletters","Semis stocks have been smacked down in the past week, falling more than 1% even as the broader market rose. The chipmaker crush could continue and investors should be selective, warns Mark Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners. “This is where you look for companies that fit secular themes that you want to be a part of, themes you want to play, so you find them, you wait for them to fall into your lap at a price that makes sense,” Tepper said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “Let’s look at Nvidia as an example.” Nvidia has been hit hard in recent months, far worse than the broader semis industry. The stock has tumbled 13% in the past three months, while the SMH semiconductor ETF has fallen 1%. However, Nvidia has begun to outperform the SMH ETF this month. “With Nvidia, you’re getting best-of-breed exposure to all the highest growth end markets that we want to play -- autonomous vehicles, AI, data center, gaming,” said Tepper. “It’s trading below $145 right now. And it looks really nice in the $135 to $140 range. You might even be able to get it at around $125, and it’s just a no-brainer at that level.” Nvidia would need to fall another 14% to reach $125. It touched that level at its December lows, though it has not traded firmly below there since mid-2017. The rest of the semis space may have to endure even more swings, according to the charts. “We’re going to be chopping around a lot because the recent volatility that has been injected into the SMH feels like we’re back in the beginning of 2018,” MKM Partners chief market technician JC O’Hara said during the same segment. “If you remember, this ETF whipped around 15% to 20% nearly every single week.” O’Hara notes that the SMH ETF saw a major overreaction to the downside in December, which then kicked off a major overreaction to the upside earlier this year. The semis space could be in the middle of its next downswing, he says.  “Investing in the SMH is very difficult here. I think volatility is coming back.

13,All-electric jet firm Eviation announces US airline as first customer,"All-electric jet firm Eviation announces US regional airline as first customer, predicts delivery in 2022. MORE IN PARIS AIR SHOW.","PARIS — The Israeli start-up Eviation announced at the Paris Air Show that U.S regional airline Cape Air is to buy its electric aircraft. Eviation is developing a nine-passenger aircraft designed to fly up to 650 miles at around 240 knots (276 miles per hour). A commercial jet would cruise around 500 miles per hour. The electric plane — called Alice with a prototype being unveiled at the show this week — is designed for the sort of distances usually conducted by train. Cape Air is set to buy a “double-digit” number of the plane which has a list price of around $4 million each. It’s expected that any customer would be able to negotiate a smaller figure. The company’s chief executive, Omer Bar-Yohay, told a press conference Tuesday that he expected to receive certification by late 2021, with deliveries predicted for 2022. “This aircraft is not some future maybe. It is there, ready and waiting,” he said. Bar-Yohay cited the contributions from Honeywell who built the plane’s controls as well as Siemens, and magniX who provided the electric motor and related functions. Bar-Yohay said the plane would now travel to Arizona in the United States where it would be flight tested before being put forward for certification with the U.S. FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). The CEO added the plane should satisfy FAA concerns that it might create a backlog of training for pilots, as it was “probably one of the easiest planes to fly,” adding “this is one of the specimens that the FAA wants to see happen.” The Eviation boss said that eventually, future planes would be built in the United States. Most of Eviation’s funding is from Clermont Group, the private investment fund of Singapore-based billionaire Richard Chandler. Clermont has given Eviation $76 million in exchange for a 70% stake in the company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated January 3. In a in a letter to staff, Chandler said commercial-scale electric aircraft would “change the culture of air travel for future generations,” and that the aerospace industry was entering a new era. “45% of all flights are under 500 miles – approximately the distance from London to Zurich, or New York to Detroit. This puts almost half of all global flights within the range of an electric motor.” Clermont also owns and funds magniX, the firm that manufactures the three","Jun 18, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/all-electric-jet-firm-eviation-announces-us-airline-as-first-customer.html

Among the shares trading on the S&P BSE Allcap index, Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra), Manpasand Beverages, Eros International Media, PC Jeweller, Jet Airways (India), Sintex Industries and Kridhan Infra have plunged in the range of 50 per cent to 62 per cent during the period. Furthermore, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL), Jammu & Kashmir Bank, S Chand & Company, Jain Irrigation Systems and Cox & Kings have slipped 30 to 49 per cent in the past month. Since May 28, the S&P BSE Smallcap and S&P BSE Midcap index have slipped 6 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. In comparison, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has lost 1.8 per cent. Besides RInfra, Reliance Capital, Reliance Communications, Reliance Naval and Engineering, Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Power from the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) have tanked more than 30 per cent.
