5,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. Investors got a fresh reminder of how difficult it is right now to be,"   Airline shares were under pressure on Wednesday as a number of carriers updated their outlook for the third quarter, highlighting the slow pace of the industry's recovery. Concerns that the U.S. government will not be offering any further assistance also weighed on the shares. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) led the way down, off by as much as 6.1% at one point, while shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) were off by nearly 6% and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) shares were down nearly 5% on a highly volatile trading day for the sector. Every U.S. airline stock is down as of 2:30 EDT, even as the S&P 500 is up more than 2.3%. The airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has limited air travel for much of the year and depressed industry revenue. The carriers are not expecting traffic to return until after there is a widely distributed vaccine, but the stocks in recent months have tended to trade up and down on any guidance that would suggest a quicker, or slower, recovery. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The stocks got a lift on Tuesday after a relatively busy Labor Day holiday weekend, but airline management teams threw cold water on that optimism on Wednesday. In a series of regulatory filings and presentations at a Wall Street conference, industry leaders said to expect a slow, choppy recovery. United Airlines Holdings cut third-quarter guidance and said it does not expect the recovery ""to follow a linear path."" American, meanwhile, said it was in discussions with Boeing about deferring the delivery of 18 737 MAX jets and said it is considering applying for more U.S. Treasury loans as it looks to boost its total liquidity. Fears that airlines will be excluded from any new stimulus plan passed in Washington were also weighing on the stocks. The industry received $50 billion as part of the CARES Act, including $25 billion conditioned on the airlines doing no layoffs prior to Sept. 30. Union leaders are in Washington this week lobbying for an extension of that funding, and the layoff prohibition, but airlines are not part of draft legislation floated by Senate leadership. Absent an assist from Washington, look for the airlines to aggressively shrink their operations in October. American has said it could shed up to 40,000 jobs, while Spirit and Southwest, along with United, have deals in place","Sep 9, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/09/why-airline-shares-are-falling-today/
6,Why the Stock Market Bounce Didn't Lift Airlines Wednesday | The Motley Fool,Why the Stock Market Bounce Didn't Lift Airlines Wednesday. Carriers got left out of a big rally.. Today's stock market.,"   The stock market finally moved higher on Wednesday, ending a streak of three big losing days for major market benchmarks. There wasn't any particularly obvious news that prompted the bounce, but the rise in volatility that investors have seen recently made the abrupt about-face in stock price movements easier to understand. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) were up 1.5% to 2%, while the Nasdaq Composite managed to climb somewhat higher. Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow +1.60% +440 S&P 500 +2.01% +67 Nasdaq Composite +2.71% +294 DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. Even with a nice performance from the markets overall, not every sector was able to keep up. In particular, airline stocks slumped across the board, and shareholders seem nervous about whether the optimism that's lifting the rest of the stock market will end up applying to air carriers. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. None of the airlines was spared from declines, although the size of the down moves differed from stock to stock. Leading the way lower were American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), which fell more than 4%. Losses of 3% were more common, hitting United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA). Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) got a bit of a break, falling just 2% along with Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK). JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) fared the best with declines of just 1.5%. The general mood among airline investors took a hit for a couple of reasons. First, United chose to reduce its guidance for the third quarter. The carrier now expects to see passenger revenue plunge 85% from year-ago levels, down from a previous prediction for an 83% drop. That comes even as United has cut its capacity by about 70%, slightly more than the 65% reduction it previously anticipated. More broadly, investors were troubled by the fact that the recovery in air travel has been slow and thus far had only minimal impact on airlines' finances. Over the Labor Day weekend, passenger counts at U.S. airports topped 900,000 on a couple of days. That's the best since before the COVID-19 pandemic, but it's still down by far more than half from year-ago levels. Another source of worry came from the impending end of programs designed to help airlines.

8,Airline Stocks And JETS ETF Slump Despite Furlough Agreement,Airline Stocks And JETS ETF Slump Despite Furlough Agreement. RELATED TOPICS. FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER. SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER!.,"Airline stocks and related ETFs are falling on Wednesday, even as United Airlines and the union that represents the carrier’s 13,000 pilots have come to an agreement that could prevent furloughs of nearly 3,000 pilots. Despite the news, United Airlines tumbled Wednesday while the majority of the broad market has been recovering from a brutal loss in technology shares that has dragged the rest of the market down over the last week. The coronavirus pandemic has stymied travel demand, hurting all air carriers. As a result, United announced last month that the airline is scheduled to furlough almost 16,000 employees, including 2,850 pilots, beginning Oct. 1 when the terms of federal aid that prevented job cuts concludes. The union and United have yet to offer details of the agreement and to what extent it would lower expenses. It also wasn’t immediately determined the period of time that the plan would allow for the furloughs to be postponed or avoided, as the agreement still requires ratification by union members and leaders. United said in a statement that it continues “to try and reduce the number of involuntary furloughs at United and are happy we were able to reach an agreement in principle with ALPA that can potentially save pilot jobs.”   The airline also asserted the need to reduce fall schedules due to the cyclicality and the coronavirus pandemic. “Because October is typically a slower month for leisure travel, we’re adjusting our schedules to reflect these seasonal changes in customer demand while resuming service or adding capacity on routes where we’re seeing increased customer demand for travel,” said company spokesman Ankit Gupta. The company is not the only air carrier to lay off workers. Last month Delta Air Lines announced furloughs of over 1,900 of its aviators if it doesn’t reach an agreement with its union. Meanwhile, other airlines like Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and JetBlue Airways have also arrived at agreements with their pilots’ unions to eschew furloughs. All major U.S. airlines have also proffered premature retirement packages and other benefits in an effort to defray involuntary cuts once the federal aid terminates, while unions are lobbying lawmakers to provide additional aid for lost jobs.

Slack — Shares of Slack tanked 14% after its quarter results showed steady growth instead of an expected boost from the coronavirus. Although it beat on full-year guidance, the team communications software company’s revenue growth came in below 50% on an annualized basis, in line with the two previous quarters.That’s a disappointment compared with video-calling software company Zoom, which showed 355% growth during the pandemic. Slack did not reinstate billings guidance due to the volatile environment, which analysts said is also pressuring the stock. Tesla – Shares of the electric auto maker jumped about 5% as the stock sought to claw back some of its recent losses. On Tuesday the stock dropped 21.06% for its single worst day on record after the company was not added to the S&P 500 after widespread speculation that it would be included in the benchmark index. Tiffany — Tiffany shares dropped more than 8% after Louis Vuitton owner LVMH said it was scrapping a $16.2 billion acquisition of the jewelry company. LVMH said the deal couldn’t be completed “as it stands,” noting it needs to figure out the impact from potential U.S. tariffs on French goods. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported Tiffany filed a lawsuit to enforce the agreement.

14,LUV Stock Is in Exclusive Company But Staying There Is Key | InvestorPlace,Southwest Airlines Is in Exclusive Company But Will It Stay There?. LUV stock needs a lot of things to go," In mid-August, S&P Global Ratings stated that only three airlines had investment-grade bonds: Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY), and easyJet (OTCMKTS:ESYJY). Before the novel coronavirus, just one-third of the world’s airlines weren’t investment grade. If LUV stock wants to continue its recovery from May lows, it’s got to hang on to that rating. At the moment, Southwest is the only U.S. airline with investment grade bonds and it shows in the year-to-date performance of the big four. Southwest has a total return of -26% through Sep. 8, followed by -45% for Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), -53% for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), lagging the pack at -58.5%. The only thing surprising about these results is that American is ahead of United. As far as I know, American’s debt situation is the worst of the bunch. I guess the markets aren’t efficient, after all. As we sit here with a little less than four months left in 2020, a forgetful one for the airlines, LUV stock is getting crushed a little less than the other three. To stay that way, its balance sheet has got to remain sound. The investment-grade rating is but one part of the package. Nonetheless, keeping this status is critical to Southwest’s share price recovery. So too, is the return of passengers. Will Southwest retain its special place in the debt markets? Here’s a quick look at both sides of the argument. In April, Southwest received $3.3 billion in payroll support from the federal government through the $2 trillion CARES Act. A significant portion ($2.3 billion) was for payroll support through the end of September. That isn’t repayable. The remaining funds ($948 million) were in the form of a 10-year, low-interest loan of 1% for the first five years and the secured overnight financing rate plus 2% for the remaining five years. The government also got 2.6 million warrants to buy Southwest shares at $36.47. They have a five-year term through April 2025. At the time, it also signed a non-binding agreement to borrow an additional $2.8 billion from the Treasury Department. However, on Aug. 19, Southwest turned down the loan stating that the deal included the issuance of additional warrants to the Treasury. In doing so, Southwest’s shareholders would have been diluted, putting its investment-grade rating on its debt at risk.

15,Ryanair steels for winter 'write-off' as travel gloom deepens | MarketScreener,MarketScreener Homepage  >  Equities  >  Euronext Paris  >  Air France-KLM    AF,"""The winter of 2020 will be a write-off,"" Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary predicted in an interview. Europe's biggest low-cost carrier is preparing to close some bases and shrink others, he told Reuters. Airlines have blamed an uneven patchwork of travel restrictions and quarantine rules across Europe for a stop-go recovery that has proven tougher than many expected. Ryanair's low-cost rival easyJet, already cutting 4,500 jobs and closing three UK bases, further reduced its flying schedule for the current quarter on Tuesday. And Wizz Air, which had touted an aggressive push for market share and even a new London Gatwick base, last week scaled down operations for the current quarter to 60% of capacity from the previously expected 80%. Overall, September short-haul schedules have been cut to 43% of European capacity from 47.6% in August, Barclays analyst Rishika Savjani said - and that only tells part of the story. ""We think demand is tracking below these levels, and therefore we'd expect weaker load factors and weaker pricing for the quarter,"" Savjani said in a Tuesday note, referring to a key metric for the proportion of aircraft seats filled. ""Pricing is going to be aggressively down"" in coming months, the Ryanair boss said. O'Leary was among the first CEOs to warn of a virus-induced price war in comments since borne out by a recovering Chinese market, where some carriers now offer all-you-can-fly deals. Ryanair now expects to fly 50 million passengers in the fiscal year to March, one-third of the previous year's number. The goal was previously cut to 60 million in July from 80 million in May and could go lower still, O'Leary cautioned. ""We're probably looking at closing more bases and withdrawing more capacity in those countries where you're operating completely defective and non-scientific quarantines,"" he added - citing Britain, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. Fourteen-day Western European infection rates that have risen to 64.9 per 100,000 from 19.4 in late July are ""not reflected in share prices"", with airline stocks up 14% over the period, Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson warned. Behind the cutback announcements, Ryanair and Wizz remain relatively well positioned over traditional airlines with more ""exposure to high-risk long-haul markets"", Simpson said. Further setbacks may leave legacy carriers like Air France-KLM and Lufthansa in need of yet more funding on top of their multibillion-euro state-backed bailouts, other analysts warn.

(NASDAQ: GROW) (the “Company”), a boutique registered investment advisory firm with longstanding experience in global markets and specialized sectors, today reported a net loss of $4.7 million, or $0.31 per share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This compares to a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.22 per share, for the prior fiscal year. Operating loss improved in fiscal 2020, from a $2.8 million loss in fiscal 2019 to a $2.4 million loss in fiscal 2020. This was due to an increase in operating revenues, somewhat offset by an increase in operating expenses. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the Company’s two ETFs, which, as discussed further below, have seen increased inflows since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Although the Company recorded a net operating loss for fiscal 2020, it is pleased to have seen a significant improvement in the quarter ended June 30, which saw an operating loss of $245,000, a 75 percent improvement over the operating loss of $979,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. What’s more, heading into August, the Company had over $2 billion in total net assets for the first time since February 2012.  Almost half of the net loss for fiscal 2020 is due to unrealized investment losses related to decreases in valuation of corporate investments. The adoption of a new accounting pronouncement in fiscal year 2018 required changes in the fair value of the Company’s equity investments formerly classified as available-for-sale to no longer be reported through other comprehensive income, but rather through earnings. This change in accounting has resulted in investment income and losses being more volatile quarter-to-quarter. For fiscal year 2020, the Company had a total investment loss of $2.2 million compared to a $1.6 million investment loss in fiscal year 2019. Like net income, though, investment income was positive for the quarter ended June 30.  Total assets under management (AUM) on June 30, 2020, stood at $1.7 billion, a more than threefold increase from $510.1 million a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to inflows into the Company’s two ETFs, particularly the smart-beta 2.0 airlines ETF, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS). Assets in JETS started to accelerate in the latter part of March 2020 and were $1.2 billion at fiscal year-end, as many value investors","Sep 10, 2020",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/10/2092092/0/en/U-S-Global-Investors-Pleased-to-Report-Assets-Under-Management-Up-More-Than-Three-Times-Financial-Results-for-the-2020-Fiscal-Year.html
17,Morgan Stanley Bullish on Airlines as Labor Day Air Traffic Highest Since March - U.S. Global ETFs,Morgan Stanley Bullish on Airlines as Labor Day Air Traffic Highest Since March. Labor Day Air Traffic at Post-Pandemic High.,"Morgan Stanley turned bullish on airlines following a busy Labor Day travel weekend that saw the number of people flying commercial jump to a new post-pandemic high, and as United Airlines announces plans to reach 40 percent of last year’s flight schedule in October. In a note to clients dated September 8, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote they have an “attractive view” of airlines, especially those with high domestic leisure exposure. The firm gave four carriers an overweight rating: Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Delta Air Lines and Allegiant Travel. Alaska Air was rated equal-weight. “We are bullish on [the] timeline of recovery in airline traffic, which underpins our Attractive industry view and drives significant upside to our average price target,” analyst Ravi Shanker said in the note. Shanker predicts a “relatively quick rebound in traffic” once a safe, effective vaccine to the virus is made available. Air travel demand could return to pre-COVID levels by late 2021, according to Shanker. Demand has already begun to recover, based on the daily number of passengers screened by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). On Friday, September 4, over 968,000 people boarded commercial flights in the U.S., the most since March 17. That’s up more than 1,000 percent from the low set in mid-April, but it’s still approximately 56 percent down from the number of travelers a year earlier. We believe the steady decline in daily new COVID infections in the U.S. is an additional component to the recovery in air travel. States that were once coronavirus hotspots have managed to bring their new infection cases down considerably, with Florida on Monday reporting the fewest new cases in three months and Arizona reporting the lowest number since March. Domestic airline stocks have responded positively to these developments. The S&P 500 Airlines Index finished Tuesday’s trading session up 1.5 percent, even as the broader S&P 500 plunged 2.8 percent, its third straight day of losses. This comes after airlines soared an incredible 19.8 percent in August, their best one-month gain since December 2009. Although not favored by Morgan Stanley, United Airlines plans to go after leisure travelers by resuming previously canceled routes and adding new ones. In a statement dated September 4, United said it will fly 40 percent of its full schedule next month compared to its October 2019 schedule. That’s up from 34 percent this month.

Europe’s biggest low-cost carrier is preparing to close some bases and shrink others, he told Reuters. Airlines have blamed an uneven patchwork of travel restrictions and quarantine rules across Europe for a stop-go recovery that has proven tougher than many expected. Ryanair's low-cost rival easyJet EZJ.L, already cutting 4,500 jobs and closing three UK bases, further reduced its flying schedule for the current quarter on Tuesday. And Wizz Air WIZZ.L, which had touted an aggressive push for market share and even a new London Gatwick base, last week scaled down operations for the current quarter to 60% of capacity from the previously expected 80%. Overall, September short-haul schedules have been cut to 43% of European capacity from 47.6% in August, Barclays analyst Rishika Savjani said - and that only tells part of the story. “We think demand is tracking below these levels, and therefore we’d expect weaker load factors and weaker pricing for the quarter,” Savjani said in a Tuesday note, referring to a key metric for the proportion of aircraft seats filled. “Pricing is going to be aggressively down” in coming months, the Ryanair boss said. O’Leary was among the first CEOs to warn of a virus-induced price war in comments since borne out by a recovering Chinese market, where some carriers now offer all-you-can-fly deals. Ryanair now expects to fly 50 million passengers in the fiscal year to March, one-third of the previous year’s number. The goal was previously cut to 60 million in July from 80 million in May and could go lower still, O’Leary cautioned. “We’re probably looking at closing more bases and withdrawing more capacity in those countries where you’re operating completely defective and non-scientific quarantines,” he added - citing Britain, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. Fourteen-day Western European infection rates that have risen to 64.9 per 100,000 from 19.4 in late July are “not reflected in share prices”, with airline stocks up 14% over the period, Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson warned. Behind the cutback announcements, Ryanair and Wizz remain relatively","Sep 9, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ryanair-idUSKBN2601RA
