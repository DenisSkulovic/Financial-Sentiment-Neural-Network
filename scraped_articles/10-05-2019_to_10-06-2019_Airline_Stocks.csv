2,Here's What American Airlines Group Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAL) P/E Ratio Is Telling Us - Simply Wall St News,Here's What American Airlines Group Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAL) P/E Ratio Is Telling Us. How Do I Calculate American Airlines Group's Price,"The goal of this article is to teach you how to use price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll look at American Airlines Group Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAL) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. American Airlines Group has a P/E ratio of 7.61, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 13.1%. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group The formula for P/E is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for American Airlines Group: P/E of 7.61 = $25.83 ÷ $3.39 (Based on the year to June 2019.) A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each $1 the company has earned over the last year. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future. One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (8.6) for companies in the airlines industry is higher than American Airlines Group's P/E. Its relatively low P/E ratio indicates that American Airlines Group shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. When earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down. American Airlines Group's 103% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. Regrettably, the longer term performance is poor, with EPS down per year over 3 years. The market might therefore be optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling. Don't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash). Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is","Oct 5, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group/news/heres-what-american-airlines-group-inc-s-nasdaqaal-p-e-ratio-is-telling-us

Samsung’s Stock Is Signaling a Bottom for the Global Chip,"    Latest Videos  Oct 6, 2019  Heejin Kim, Bloomberg News Samsung Electronics Co. 4GB Double-Data-Rate (DDR) 3 memory module, top, and 8GB DDR 3 memory modules are arranged for a photograph in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, July 9, 2019. Resurgent tensions between Japan and South Korea threaten to wallop chipmakers from Samsung Electronics Co. to SK Hynix Inc., upsetting a carefully choreographed global supply chain by smothering the production of memory chips and other components vital to widely used devices. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Investors have grown increasingly bullish on Samsung Electronics Co. ahead of its Tuesday results report, betting that the global memory-chip cycle is near a bottom. The company’s shares have rallied 24% this year, overcoming three straight quarters of disappointing earnings and delayed shareholder return improvement on hopes for an end to the years-long semiconductor downcycle. That’s left some punters questioning how much upside can be left amid concerns including the U.S.-China trade war and South Korea’s spat with Japan. “The stock may face a short-term correction after the earnings announcement, as the expectation of a rebound in earnings has already been priced in,” said Heo Pil-Seok, chief executive officer at Midas International Asset Management. “Still, from a medium-term perspective, we have confirmed that the semiconductor industry has reached a bottom.” Samsung is due to report preliminary third-quarter results on Tuesday. Analysts estimate it will post operating income of 6.9 trillion won, compared with the record 17 trillion won it reported a year earlier. While most of the disappointment has been due to declining prices for memory chips, which account for nearly 80% of the company’s operating income, there have been some signs of improvement recently. Spot prices for 4GB DRAM chips fell 0.8% in the third quarter, less than than the 24% drop in the previous quarter. “The situation in the global memory-chip industry seems to be good, and I guess the third-quarter earnings will be slightly better than the current market consensus,” said Lee Jin-Ho, a fund manager at Eugene Asset Management in Seoul. Analysts were similarly optimistic on signs of a chip cycle bottom after a weak forecast last week from U.S. peer Micron Technology Inc. The third-biggest player in the global memory-chip industry -- after Samsung and its Korean compatriot SK Hynix Inc. -- said it’s vulnerable to the U.S.-China trade war and that","Oct 6, 2019",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/samsung-s-stock-is-signaling-a-bottom-for-the-global-chip-market-1.1327391
6,Is Sprint a Buy? | The Motley Fool,Is Sprint a Buy?. This struggling telecom is more of a lottery ticket than an investment.. You really don't want,"       Sprint' s (NYSE:S) merger with fellow wireless telecom T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), a year and a half in the making, is still up in the air. Buying Sprint shares today is a firm bet that the deal will be approved and consummated in its current form. Anything short of that would be downright bad news for Sprint shareholders. Let's be clear: Sprint is probably dead meat if the T-Mobile merger falls apart. This is clearly the weakest of the four major American wireless networks, more likely to lose subscribers than gain them in any given quarter. Dissatisfied with Sprint's particular combination of service quality and plan prices, subscribers leave Sprint more often than they do from any of the other majors, forcing the company to rely on expensive promotions to keep their subscriber counts reasonably stable. T-Mobile isn't trying to buy a strong competitor with a large and high-quality customer roll. Adding Sprint's 54 million subscribers to T-Mobile's 83 million customer won't hurt, of course, but this deal is really all about Sprint's valuable collection of radio spectrum licenses. Cancel the merger and watch Sprint's long slide into oblivion continue. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The merger deal calls for each Sprint share to be converted into 0.10256 T-Mobile stubs. Since T-Mobile is trading at roughly $78 per share today, that works out to a final deal-powered value of $8 per share. But this ain't no sure thing. Sprint's stock is fetching just $6.11 per stub right now, some 24% below the promised buyout value. On the upside, this discount gives you a chance to buy Sprint stock today and watch it rise in value if and when the merger takes effect -- assuming, of course, that T-Mobile's share prices hold steady. On the other hand, this sharp discount serves notice that investors are worried about the regulatory outcome here. The Trump administration has long been sending mixed signals about its willingness to approve this deal. Recent moves have generally pointed in a positive direction, but you just never know what Trump or FCC Chairman Ajit Pai might say or do next. So, investors are taking a big risk here, weighing the promise of a 25% value boost against the far darker conclusion of owning a stand-alone Sprint on its own merits. I'm an investor, not a gambler. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend owning Sprint shares","Oct 5, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/05/is-sprint-a-buy.aspx
