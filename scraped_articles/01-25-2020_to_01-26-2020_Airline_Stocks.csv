0,"Coronavirus hits stock markets: United Airlines, travel stocks drop",Coronavirus is rattling stock markets: Here's why – and who's getting hit the hardest. Why are investors worried?. Which U.S.,"NEW YORK – Stocks around the world fell this week on worries that a new type of virus in China may ultimately hit profits for companies from Wuhan to Washington. The World Health Organization has held off on calling the outbreak a global health emergency but says it may become one. The coronavirus has killed more than two dozen people and infected more than 800, with the epicenter in the city of Wuhan in central China. The virus can transmit from human to human, which increases its potential spread. Fourth US coronavirus case confirmed in California:Infection can spread before symptoms show Past outbreaks of disease have caused sharp losses for stocks, at least temporarily. Stocks in Hong Kong lost about 10% in March and April of 2003 when the number of new SARS cases confirmed was accelerating, for example. Besides the physical toll of illnesses and deaths, fear of disease can cause people to stop traveling, shopping and eating out at restaurants. Even if the disease stays mostly outside the United States, it can significantly hurt profits for U.S. companies. China accounted for 6% of all revenue for S&P 500 companies over the past 12 months, nearly double any other country besides the United States, according to FactSet. “It can have broad impacts well beyond China,” Procter & Gamble CFO Jon Moeller told analysts Thursday. Companies that get lots of business directly from China, particularly in the travel industry, are being hurt most. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts get the majority of their revenue from casinos in Macao, on the southern coast of China. Each lost more than 8% this past week. Airlines have been hurt by worries that the outbreak will keep customers from flying not only to and from China but across the region. United Airlines dropped 8.7% this week. It has about 5.5% of its capacity allocated to U.S-China/Hong Kong routes, more than its big rivals, according to Stifel analysts. But the impact could be felt beyond China. Consider Hawaii. Chinese tourists are the highest-spending visitors to the state, shelling out $349 per person per day in 2018. If Chinese vacationers stay home, U.S. hoteliers are vulnerable even if they have no locations in Asia. European luxury companies as a group get about 35% of their sales from Chinese customers, including sales made in China and in Europe by visiting Chinese tourists, according to J.P.

1,"Earnings could spark a significant sell-off, Art Hogan warns","Earnings could spark a significant pullback this week, long-time market bull Art Hogan warns. “Historically stretched”. MORE IN TRADING NATION.","Long-time market bull Art Hogan is on pullback alert. With the busiest period of earnings season kicking off this week, the National Securities chief market strategist warns conditions are ripe for a significant move lower. “Stocks are relatively priced for perfection, and you tend to have a bit of an overreaction to bad news or in-line news when that happens,” he told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “My guess is if we’re going to rationalize a market that’s pretty stretched right here, it’s going to happen right now.” Hogan sees fourth quarter results as the top risk to the record market rally — bigger than coronavirus fears and Mideast tensions. “We have about a third of the S&P 500 reporting. We’re going to see the losers lose a whole lot more than we’ve seen in a while,” he said. “The index itself could probably pull back 3% to 5%.” According to Hogan, the market’s biggest winners will likely get hit the hardest. “There are five technology names that are driving a good chunk of the movement in the S&P. On the other side, you see the utilities index,” he said. “The index is trading at 25 times and it’s throwing out a dividend that’s less than 3%. Both of those numbers are historically stretched. This is an index that usually trades at 16 times and has about a 5% dividend.” But Hogan, whose S&P 500 year-end target is 3,450, contends it’s no reason to turn bearish. He’s looking at the next downturn as a key buying opportunity. Hogan and his firm have taken steps to capitalize on a leg lower. Similar to Blackstone, increasing the cash has been a major strategy. “Our cash levels coming into the first quarter have been higher than they historically are,” Hogan said. The S&P 500 fell 30 points on Friday to close at 3,295. It’s now 1.3% off its record high. Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

3,Winners and Losers From Boeing's 'Even Further' MAX Delay | The Motley Fool,Winners and Losers From Boeing's 'Even Further' MAX Delay. Three airlines stand to benefit.. Winner: Airbus. Loser: Boeing. Winner: Delta,"   On Jan. 21, 2020, Boeing (NYSE:BA) announced a further delay in its anticipated ungrounding of the 737 MAX, stating expectations for mid-2020. The January release was a painful follow-up to a December 2019 announcement in which Boeing said it would suspend 737 MAX production starting in January 2020 as a result of uncertain Federal Aviation Administration and global regulatory authorities' reservice approval. The news is crippling to Boeing, which had reached production of around 400 MAX planes that it cannot sell despite thousands of pre-orders from airlines across the world. Worst of all is that mid-2020 is simply Boeing's best guess, and that means airlines who expected to be flying dozens of 737 MAX aircraft by now might have fewer planes to respond to the summer travel season this year. Here are the biggest winners and losers from Boeing's announcement, some of which may surprise you.  EADSY DATA BY YCHARTS. Boeing is the biggest loser, suffering more than just a revenue hit. The company's rival, Airbus (OTC:EADSY), had a backlog of 7,471 as of Oct. 31, 2019, versus Boeing's 5,488 backlog as of September 30, 2019.  Airbus makes a similar product to Boeing's 737, the Airbus 320, which, like Boeing's 737, makes up the vast majority of production. According to Forecast International, 88% of Airbus' backlog is A220 and A320 ceo/neo family narrow-bodies. 4,406, or 80% of Boeing's backlog, are 737s.  For years, Boeing was the undisputed leader in the aircraft business, but that's no longer the case. Although Boeing is about 50% larger than Airbus by market capitalization, its lead has been narrowing. The MAX delays further encourage airlines to question their fleets of the future. The most notable recent announcement came in December 2019, when United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) ordered 50 new Airbus A321s to replace its Boeing 757-200 planes, which are no longer in production. Boeing's superior engineering and craftsmanship are fleeting arguments in the face of a rival company with a competitive product and newfound pricing power. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), the largest U.S. airline by market capitalization, doesn't have any 737 MAX aircraft in its fleet. This gives Delta a distinct advantage over other airlines who forecasted flights with the 737 MAX. Delta's $7.31 2019 earnings per share (EPS) represented 30% year-over-year (YoY) growth. With a 2020 outlook of $6.75 to $7.75 EPS, Delta's growth is","Jan 25, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/25/winners-and-losers-from-boeings-even-further-max-d.aspx
4,The Boeing 737 MAX Crisis Will Crush American Airlines' Profit Again in 2020 | The Motley Fool,"The Boeing 737 MAX Crisis Will Crush American Airlines' Profit Again in 2020. For a second straight year, the Boeing","   A year ago, American Airlines' (NASDAQ:AAL) management predicted that the company's adjusted earnings per share would rise to between $5.50 and $7.50 in 2019. It was an aggressive forecast, considering that adjusted EPS totaled just $4.55 in 2018. However, with fuel prices having fallen significantly in the last few months of 2018 and various other margin improvement drivers scheduled to ramp up during 2019, the guidance wasn't totally unrealistic, either. Unfortunately, the grounding of Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX beginning last March dashed all hope of achieving the 2019 earnings target. Moreover, with the 737 MAX now likely to stay grounded for most of 2020, American Airlines' management doesn't expect meaningful margin improvement or EPS growth this year. When the Boeing 737 MAX was grounded last March, airlines initially thought it would be cleared to resume service within a few months, prior to the busy summer season. That optimistic view didn't last long. As of late April, when American Airlines held its Q1 2019 earnings call, the airline had removed the 737 MAX from its schedule through Aug. 19. Still, management expressed confidence (based on conversations with Boeing and the FAA) that the troubled jet would be recertified well before that date. However, Boeing and global regulators gradually identified more and more issues needing to be resolved prior to recertification. This caused the timeline for recertification to slip into the fall, then into December, and -- as of a few weeks ago -- into the first quarter of 2020. Earlier this week, Boeing acknowledged that it now expects regulators to begin recertifying the 737 MAX in mid-2020. The most recent delay is related to the aerospace giant's decision to recommend simulator training for all 737 MAX pilots. Given the lingering uncertainty over the exact timing of recertification and the time necessary to take aircraft out of storage and complete necessary crew training, this timeline almost certainly implies a return to scheduled service in the fall. In its investor update last April -- six weeks after the 737 MAX was grounded -- American Airlines slashed its full-year EPS guidance to a range of $4 to $6. This reflected $350 million in lost operating income related to the grounding, as well as an uptick in fuel prices. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. Oil prices quickly receded after peaking last April, but American's earnings forecast never recovered. To some extent, that reflected","Jan 25, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/25/the-boeing-737-max-crisis-will-crush-american-airl.aspx

A Well-Moated, High-Return Bet on One of the Worst Industries.","""Now let's move to the gruesome. The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money. Think airlines. Here a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down. The airline industry's demand for capital ever since that first flight has been insatiable. Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it. And I, to my shame, participated in this foolishness when I had Berkshire buy U.S. Air preferred stock in 1989. As the ink was drying on our check, the company went into a tailspin, and before long our preferred dividend was no longer being paid. But we then got very lucky. In one of the recurrent, but always misguided, bursts of optimism for airlines, we were actually able to sell our shares in 1998 for a hefty gain. In the decade following our sale, the company went bankrupt. Twice."" – Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)’s 2007 letter to shareholders  Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) is well-known for his long-held bearish stance on the airline industry, comparing the business to the so-called “gruesome savings account” (as described above). Indeed, the airline industry had a terrible time in the 1900s with almost 100 bankruptcies. Typically, these companies have to deal with tough problems throughout day-to-day operations, including high fixed costs, commoditized services, volatile fuel prices, labor issues, safety concerns and, probably most importantly, fierce competition. When Buffett made his infamous purchase of USAir’s preferred stock in 1989, over 20 major airlines were operating in the U.S. That number has dramatically fallen thanks to decades of consolidation, reducing the competition in the space. Maybe that was the reason why the Oracle of Omaha's enthusiasm for the space was reignited three years ago, establishing large stakes in Delta (NYSE:DAL), American (NASDAQ:AAL), United (NASDAQ:UAL) and Southwest (NYSE:LUV). While the return on capital for those airlines has stabilized at a decent level, the long-term uncertainties of their business economics do remain. In the meantime, we think there are better options for airline lovers, especially those who invest internationally with a (much) smaller amount of capital to deploy (than Buffett).

8,Air Canada Investors: This Airline Finally Looks Fully Valued - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Air Canada Investors: This Airline Finally Looks Fully Valued. Potential headwinds. Potential,"      Chris MacDonald | January 25, 2020 | More on: AC I’ve been commenting (more like screaming) on the Motley Fool for years that Air Canada (TSX:AC.B)(TSX:AC) has been undervalued, and has remained undervalued compared to its peers in the U.S. and its main domestic competitor, Westjet Airlines Ltd. Watching Air Canada’s stock price rise to incredible highs of late is something that isn’t entirely unexpected given the fundamentals underpinning this airline in this competitive space. From a valuation perspective, Air Canada has gained significant ground on its peers, and while still cheaper than Westjet, shares of Air Canada may now be getting into the uncomfortable situation of flying too high too quickly, meaning that the risk with respect to this stock now outweighs potential reward for some conservative long-term investors. With memories of a near-liquidation in the minds of many investors without a long track record of investing, it should be noted that airlines in general are highly susceptible to negative macro events. One only has to think back to serious recessions, 9/11 or other airline scares, which push the public away from flying toward staying home. With risks seemingly remaining muted, investors continue to pile into the airline sector — a move that’s created wealth for those who have bet that the industry would recover, as I recommended in recent years. The good news is that Air Canada remains strategically important to the Canadian government, and as we’ve seen with other key Canadian economic sectors, the Canadian government’s willingness to step in and bail out companies like Air Canada is a real reason to buy and hold for the long term for many investors. In other words, if things get really bad, there’s likely a floor beneath Air Canada’s share price that’s unlikely to be breached, a reality that supports the belief that the potential downside here isn’t dramatic. Air Canada’s balance sheet has looked a lot better in recent years, with the company actively de-everaging and taking advantage of increased cash flow to pay down its massive debt load — one of the concerns many long-term investors had with this airline. The ability of Air Canada to integrate Aeroplan into its loyalty program through acquisition should also not be understated, a move that’s has created stickiness with respect to the company’s flyer base and more reasons for flyers to remain loyal to","Jan 25, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/01/25/air-canada-investors-this-airline-finally-looks-fully-valued/
9,4 Powerful Growth Stocks for Short-Term Money Gains - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . 4 Powerful Growth Stocks for Short-Term Money Gains. A mining company. A,"      Adam Othman | January 25, 2020 | More on: BLDP ATD.B BLDP IVN Investment is a long-term game; there is no doubt about it. Like the Oracle of Omaha says: “If you aren’t thinking about owning a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.” This is all well and good when you are investing for retirement. If you are slowly building wealth through compounding, and you have time on your side, then conservative investment techniques usually give you the best chances of success. But you may have short-term investment goals. You may want to buy a good car, renovate your property, or plan a family vacation abroad in five years. Can’t investing help you with that? Of course it can, but the short-term prize comes with a catch. When you invest in growth stocks, it’s better to have a higher level of tolerance for risk. But you can mitigate this risk considerably by diversification and picking good stocks. For this example, let’s say I have allocated $20,000 for a short-term investments. I only have five years to grow my investments as much as I can, but I also want sufficient diversification and safety of my capital. So, I’ve picked four stocks (I’ll be putting $5,000 in each one of them) and see where it may go in five years. Ivanhoe Mining (TSX:IVN) is an African-focused mining company with one full and three partial stakes in four major mines in the African continent. The company mines copper, zinc, silver, and platinum. In terms of market value, Ivanhoe is has fallen too far from its former grandeur. It traded in the mid-20s by 2012. Now, the stock price is well under $5 ($3.98 per share at the time of writing). But the company is showing signs of coming back. The stock has been steadily climbing, and in the past five years, the company has shown a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29%. So, if the company keeps up the same pace, $5,000 today will be worth $17,861 in five years. The stock is volatile, with a beta of 2.95.

Boeing stock recovered sharply on Friday to close the week on a positive note as the FAA called U.S. airline executives to inform them the 737 MAX could be set to return to service sooner than mid-year. Unfortunately for enthusiastic BA bulls, pleasing a federal agency is going to be a cakewalk compared to winning back the public’s trust. It was undoubtedly strange timing for a headline, as the FAA’s more generous timetable for Boeing’s infamous jet’s return to the skies hit newswires late in the session on Friday. Just a few days ago, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Elaine Cho, said there was no timetable for the 737 MAX.   While it is good news for investors that the U.S.’ largest aerospace manufacturer is doing it’s best to make its plane worthy of flying again, things have come out about the production process that will never be forgotten. The monopolistic world of aviation has always relied on a circle of trust when disasters happen. Boeing spends a lot on PR, and then the public trusts the FAA to tell the airlines it’s safe, and they keep buying the jets (because they have no other option.)

The move came three days after Boeing said it didn’t expect the planes to fly until mid-year.

This comes at a time when the FAA is still dealing with the fallout from its decision to certify the 737 MAX in the first place. Reports reveal the organization failed to thoroughly inspect the plane when they gave it the stamp of approval back in 2017. A second mistake of such magnitude could do serious damage to the regulator’s already tarnished reputation.   On Friday, Steve Dickson spoke with senior officials from Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), United Airlines (NYSE: UAL), and American Airlines (NYSE: AAL). The three U.S-based carriers are the 737 MAX’s primary operators, and they own significant numbers of the grounded planes. Southwest Airlines, the biggest operator of the 737 MAX, has 34 of the planes in its fleet along with outstanding orders for hundreds more when the plane becomes ungrounded. United and American Airlines also have large back orders for the aircraft. The 737 MAX grounding has had a significant negative impact on these airlines.","Jan 26, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/boeing-737-max-to-be-approved-is-the-faa-repeating-its-fatal-mistakes/

16,Why divorce is 'financially disastrous' for retirement - Business Insider,. A financial planner says the most 'financially disastrous' consequence of divorce happens years in the future: retirement. Divorce can,"    Personal Finance Insider writes about products, strategies, and tips to help you make smart decisions with your money. We may receive a small commission from our partners, like American Express, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. A lot changes in the wake of a divorce. But the biggest impact typically doesn't come until years later. ""The most financially disastrous part of divorce is that you're taking a unit that has two incomes with one residence and one retirement goal, and you're splitting it,"" Ameriprise private wealth adviser and financial planner Ylisa Sanford tells Business Insider.  Where two incomes once supported one set of household goals, that same amount now has to support two separate households, and two separate retirements.  It's not uncommon for retirement accounts to be lost in divorce. In some states, a 401(k) is considered community property, and can be divided 50-50. Just like other investments, your retirement account could be split 50-50, and if you and your spouse weren't both contributing equally, your savings could be in jeopardy.  As Reuters' Beth Pinsker reports, the typical divorced household has a 30% lower net worth than a non-divorced household. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College estimates that divorce has a similar impact on retirement accounts to the Great Recession had in 2008: Divorced households are seven percentage points more likely not to have enough money to make it through retirement, while the Great Recession made this same scenario nine percentage points more likely. Saving early is the best way to take advantage of compound interest to boost retirement savings and grow long-term wealth. But after a divorce, you might have to start all over.  In Sanford's experience, helping your retirement funds recover from divorce starts by figuring out where they currently stand, and what needs work. ""Part of what people are required to do in the process of divorce is go through their different expenses. Think, 'What do I need for housing, groceries, dining, entertainment, travel, healthcare, medical costs? Those kinds of things,'"" she says.  Then, it's important to consider anything you've gained or lost in the divorce. ""How will any compensation be treated if there is anything such as alimony or property equalization, and what are the tax implications of that?"" Sanford says.  Then, you can start thinking about new retirement goals,","Jan 25, 2020",https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/divorce-can-compromise-retirement-savings-plans-future
