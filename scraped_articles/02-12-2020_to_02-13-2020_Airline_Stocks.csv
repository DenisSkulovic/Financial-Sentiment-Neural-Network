SAVE has PE of 9.. In 2014, the","Spirit Air insider Christine Richards bought 5000 shares of the discount airline despite worries Coronavirus could impact global travel. Richards was appointed director at Spirit Airlines Inc. (SAVE) in Sept. of last year. A Form 4 filed today disclosed the purchase of $216K of SAVE at $43.24. As Executive VP and General Counsel at FedEx Corporation until her retirement in 2017, Richards filed many Form 4s dating back to 2005. But this is her first open market purchase ever as corporate insider. News of the Coronavirus outbreak in China began impacting global markets in late January. If the virus spreads widely beyond China, there are concerns that travel-related companies’ will suffer as travelers stay home. Back in October of 2014, when news broke that a nurse in Texas had contracted Ebola, airline stocks took a hit as investors feared a boycott of air travel. However, those fears proved unfounded as only a dozen cases of Ebola occurred in the United States. Airline stocks soon rallied to new highs. Below is a chart of the Airline Index (XAL) back then. However, the recent Coronavirus scare has so far not affected U.S.-based airline stocks much. Based on Google Trends data for “coronavirus” search, the scare which began on around Jan. 20, peaked on Jan. 28. At least so far — experts caution that the virus is not under control and could yet spread globally. A global market selloff based on pandemic fears is still a possibility. Meanwhile, Spirit Air stock has managed to climb above its 200 day moving average (blue line on above chart). The upside traction has happened despite background worries about the epidemic. Operations at the low fare carrier have been on the upswing. From Motley Fool on Feb. 8: 2019 got off to a great start for Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), but it ended up being a bumpy year for the ultra-low-cost carrier. During the spring and summer, Spirit suffered from a sharp downturn in its operational performance, because of an unfortunate combination of aggressive scheduling, runway closures, and frequent severe weather events. This drove up unit costs. Meanwhile, unit revenue trends deteriorated as the year progressed, because of tougher year-over-year comparisons as well as changes in the competitive landscape. Even with all these headwinds, Spirit Airlines posted a double-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share for 2019 as a whole.

CNBC,"Tesla shares jumped on Thursday after the company announced a $2 billion stock offering. Here’s what five experts are watching now. Aswath Damodaran, professor at NYU Stern School of Business, explains why Tesla scares investors and is the “bread and butter” for traders. I describe Tesla as my corporate teenager. Every day I wake up and it’s got lots of potential and then it says, “What can I do today to screw it all up?” That’s not going to change today, it’s not going to change next week. ... This company has immense potential, but there’ll be things that show up and say, “What the heck are they doing?” ... When you have a story stock and the mood is right it doesn’t really matter what the fundamentals are, people are going to push up the price. That’s scary if you’re an investor, but if you’re a trader this is your bread and butter. Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, praises Tesla for its strategic move and how this changes the story. I think when you look at the situation for Tesla ... it’s a smart strategic move ... This from a board perspective is something, and even for the bulls, I think the Tesla story potentially changes with this, in terms of now what’s happened with the balance sheet. I think it’s going to be hard for bears to make their case. Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” said Elon Musk hasn’t done anything wrong and in reality has done what you want. Ten days ago, we weren’t as worried about China. ... Ralph Lauren told you 10 days ago that things look pretty good. They put out some numbers today which says that things look pretty bad. So, there’s real changes. I think that Musk obviously, like everybody else, is trying to keep his workers healthy but wants to expand there, and he’s got a chance. And why not take advantage of it? I think there are some people who don’t understand that there is no law against a stock appreciating 100 points and you now selling where you wouldn’t have down below 100. He didn’t do anything wrong. If anything he did what you want. Kari Firestone, chairman and CEO of Aureus Asset Management, said the illogical growth of Tesla makes it difficult to price.

Love in the time of Coronavirus: MSC Cruises thanks healthcare workers with special,"INTERNATIONAL. Global indices rose last week and are gaining in the fourth week since global investors were spooked by the spread of COVID-19 on the weekend of 17 January, writes Senior Retail and Commercial Analyst Min Yong Jung. The median of key benchmark indices rose +2.5% in week 3 and 0.9% in week 4. The recent gains in stock markets globally means stocks are close to levels prior to the strong declines witnessed during the crisis weeks. Several key benchmark indices in Europe and the US have recovered to levels prior to 20 January but Asian stocks in countries still seeing the spread of the virus remain lower. Investors have turned positive on the stock market in week 3 and week 4 and are focusing on the lower number of new confirmed cases, a decrease in new suspected cases and a reduction in medical observations in China. Despite the continued spread of the virus and negative economic impact (supply chain disruption, store closures etc.) to follow, investors experienced with previous outbreaks are aware the stock market and economy is quick to recover. In order to aid the recovery of the economy, China’s policy makers are expected to sign off on more fiscal stimulus (direct spending, tax relief and subsidies). Although the economic recovery may take longer than SARS (which shaved 1% off China’s economic growth in 2003), investors remain hopeful the Chinese government will soon announce measures that will help in the recovery. China’s decisions to apply tariff cuts on some US goods, part of the US-China ‘Phase 1’ deal also buoyed markets in week 3. Chinese authorities remain busy battling the virus and their US counterparts are focused on the 2020 US Presidential primary elections, which means conflict from trade is unlikely and de-escalation in the trade war between the two biggest economies in the world is expected to continue.

7,New airline alliance between Alaska and American will connect Seattle and Bangalore tech hubs - GeekWire,New airline alliance between Alaska and American will connect Seattle and Bangalore tech hubs. Previous Story. Next Story. GeekWire Newsletters.,"BY TAYLOR SOPER on February 13, 2020 at 7:18 am Tech executives will soon have a new direct flight option from Seattle to Bangalore, India, thanks to a West Coast alliance between Seattle-based Alaska Airlines and American Airlines. The companies announced an expanded partnership Thursday that includes codesharing, which lets travelers book flights on each others’ network, as well as the ability to earn and use loyalty benefits on both airlines. The deal also creates a new daily American direct flight from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Bangalore, described by Amazon (headquartered in Seattle) as the “Silicon Valley of India.” Both Amazon and Microsoft, also based in the Seattle region, have offices in Bangalore. That flight will launch this October, with purchases available starting next month. It’s the first-ever direct option from Seattle to Bangalore. Then in March 2021, American will start a new route from Seattle to London Heathrow. Purchases will open this May. “Alaska has always been proud to serve Seattle, the city that we call home. We’re thrilled to give our guests more choice, broader use of loyalty benefits, and seamless global service with American and oneworld,” Ben Minicucci, president of Alaska Airlines, said in a statement. “Additionally, international service to global business and tech hubs Heathrow and Bangalore is a tremendous win for the growing Seattle region and the West Coast.” “India is a grossly underserved market, despite the number of businesses with a major presence in both India and the West Coast,” Vasu Raja, American’s senior vice president, network strategy, said in a statement. “By adding Seattle to Bangalore, we’re giving customers from more than 70 U.S. cities access to India in one stop or less — versus the two, three or four stops they’d have to make to get there in the past.” The codeshare will also now expand to include American’s international routes from Los Angeles (LAX). In addition, Alaska will join the oneworld airline alliance as part of today’s announcement. See Alaska’s blog post for more details.

ASX,"As the coronavirus death toll rises to more than 1,000 and the World Health Organisation labels it a global health emergency, share markets are feeling the impact of the outbreak with Australian ASX-listed stocks not immune to the damage. Chinese officials on Tuesday confirmed the death toll from the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has hit a grim new figure of 1,016 while the number of infected cases has risen to more than 42,638 – growing by almost 2,500 in one day. Over the weekend, the death toll officially overtook the SARS outbreak, which killed 774 people over 2002 and 2003. Originating in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province, the virus has spread to 28 other countries including Australia, the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Russia, India, Japan and smaller Asian nations. With China practically in lockdown, its share market has suffered from heavily restricted tourism and trade. Australia currently has 15 confirmed cases of the virus and fear and uncertainty has weighed heavily on its stock market. China is the world’s largest outbound travel market, with passengers reportedly making about 150 million trips abroad in 2018 and airlines operating more than 130 flights from China to Australia each week. The Chinese government has recently banned international group travel in an effort to contain the spread of the virus and Australia’s government has applied its own travel restrictions and quarantine measures. As of 1 February, Australia will deny entry to foreign nationals until 14 days after they have left or transited through mainland China. Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family will be granted entry but are required to self-isolate for the incubation period. Airports and airlines have taken a hit on the stock market, with prices falling for big players such as airline giant Qantas Airways (ASX: QAN) and Sydney Airport (ASX: SYD). Travel agency Flight Centre (ASX: FLT) reported its small corporate travel operations in China, Singapore and Malaysia have been “adversely affected” and said while it was too early to judge the full year impact, “the virus’ emergence has inevitably made it more difficult to deliver the strong second-half earnings weighting implied in the full year guidance” of $310-$350 million. The company said the upcoming months were traditionally the year’s peak booking periods but both corporate and leisure travel could be affected, as well as hotel and resort operations in Thailand, Bali and Vietnam with Chinese outbound travellers being","Feb 12, 2020",https://smallcaps.com.au/coronavirus-outbreak-shakes-up-asx-share-market/

11,The Possible Effect of the Coronavirus Outbreak on the Aviation Industry and Aircraft Values | mba Aviation,The Possible Effect of the Coronavirus Outbreak on the Aviation Industry and Aircraft Values. Key Concepts:. The Possible Effect of,"In this edition of mba Aviation’s Insight Series, Sloane Churchill, Analyst – Asset Valuations, uses analysis of the effect of the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 on aircraft values and the aviation industry to provide insight on how today’s Coronavirus might take its toll. Though the Coronavirus outbreak in China is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak in 2002 – 2003, the effects on the aviation industry have the potential to be quite different. So far, the Coronavirus has infected over 45,000 people, mostly in mainland China, leading to over 1,100 deaths. This Coronavirus is proving to be faster spreading, though less deadly than SARS, with a death rate of approximately 2.1%. Historically, while global health epidemics have hurt aviation by reducing revenue passenger kilometer (RPK) growth in the short term, there have been no long-term effects for any epidemic of the last twenty years, including SARS, Avian Flu, Swine Flu, Ebola, or Zika on aircraft values or the aviation market as a whole. The SARS outbreak could provide some insight as to how aircraft values and the aviation industry might be affected by the current Coronavirus. mba values research shows SARS disproportionately affected aircraft values. Typically, older vintage and out of production aircraft were hit the hardest after the SARS outbreak, showing the most value volatility in the following two years. Newer vintage and current production aircraft were significantly less volatile. Market values for aircraft and Brent Crude prices have historically had an inverse relationship; in low fuel price environments, aircraft values tend to increase as aircraft become less expensive to operate, while market values decrease in high fuel price environments. This is especially apparent in older vintage and out of production aircraft, as they are less fuel efficient, and thus more sensitive to fuel price. However, 9/11 and the SARS epidemic broke the correlation between Brent Crude prices and market values, and this relationship does not recover until after the worst point of the SARS epidemic in 3Q 2003 for most aircraft types and classes. After the SARS outbreak, looking at narrowbody aircraft, the market value of a 1988 737-400 and A320-200 fell 14.8% and 42.0% respectively in 1Q 2003 from the previous quarter, while market values for a 1998 737-400 and A320-200 fell 15.1% and 16.7% respectively in 1Q 2003. Market values for a 1998 737-800, which technologically replaced the 737-400, dropped 11.2%.

Japan’s COVID-19 Response Transcends its Borders. Around the Web. Fighting,"A new budget airline created by a former United Airlines executive has raised $125 million in funding and plans to start service before the end of the year. The company, operating as Houston Air Holdings Inc., is “getting ready to spool up to transform this little charter airline we bought,” Andrew Levy said in an interview Wednesday. The strategy is to offer nonstop flights from secondary airports to midsize and large markets, Levy said. The project is the second new U.S. airline planning to start flights in 2020. “We’re going to grow at a measured pace,” said Levy, a co-founder of Allegiant Travel Co., which specializes in leisure travel from smaller markets to vacation destinations such as Florida and Las Vegas. “We’re going to build the company a little bit like Allegiant, slowly and steadily,” with a foundation of “far more capital than we think we’ll ever need.” The Houston-based start-up will employ a fleet of Boeing Co. 737-800s. It will take its first plane next week from General Electric Co.’s aircraft lessor, and use them for charter service over the summer. Jets will be configured with 189 seats for short-haul passenger service later in 2020. Levy is taking a different tack from David Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue Airways Corp., who’s planning to debut his new Breeze Airways late this year using Embraer SA E-195 aircraft leased from his most recent start-up carrier in Brazil, Azul SA. Neeleman also plans to add Airbus SE A220 jets. Both carriers will focus on markets they view as lacking adequate air service after U.S. airline consolidation over the past decade. But while Breeze plans to fly longer-haul service using the A220’s range on routes without nonstop competition, Levy’s is focused on shorter-distance routes connecting smaller airports with domestic leisure markets. Neeleman has pledged to invest $50 million of his own money in Breeze. He estimates that the carrier will require $65.6 million for three months of regular operations, plus $45 million for costs before it begins service. Neeleman launched JetBlue in 2000 — which involved a fleet of new Airbus A320 aircraft — after raising about $100 million in the prior three years. That’s about $150 million today, adjusted for inflation. Levy left United Airlines Holdings Inc. in May 2018 to work on forming a start-up airline. Three months later, he purchased XTRA Airways Inc., a Florida-based charter carrier.

Flair Airlines Ltd. is pulling out of the airport in Abbotsford, B.C., due to a lack of passengers and intense competition from rival budget carrier Swoop. Flair CEO Jim Scott cites an intense focus on the Abbotsford-Edmonton route by its competitor, a subsidiary of WestJet Airlines Ltd., that has resulted in a glut of cheap tickets. ""We just can't compete with $3 airfares in the market -- and not just a few of them, but tens of thousands of tickets,"" Scott said. ""Either we're going to be confined to very few routes or the government's got to step in and show that anti-dumping and predatory pricing has meaning in Canada,"" he said in a phone interview. Flair operates 12 flights between the two cities each week, but plans to stop in June. Swoop, Flair's only competitor along the route, operates 16 flights per week in winter and 24 flights per week in summer. Flair said no passengers will face cancellations as a result of the Abbotsford pullout, which will also end flights between the Lower Mainland city and Kelowna, B.C., Calgary, Winnipeg and Toronto. Swoop unveiled a so-called loonie sale last month, offering up to 100,000 seats for a base fare of $1 before taxes and fees. The sale disproportionately targets Edmonton-to-Abbotsford, which Swoop points out is its highest-frequency route.

Commentary: In the midst of COVID-19 outbreak, look out for"," Besides the ones taking the biggest hit now, there are other sectors to look out for that are poised for a rebound once the virus dies out, says James Kynge. HONG KONG: The SARS outbreak of 2003 taught Asian investors that when the disease passes, there are profits to be made.  So for many, the COVID-19 scourge is seen as cause to reposition funds in expectation of a rebound. But which sectors and stocks can be expected to come back the strongest?  There are some obvious candidates: The share prices of airlines, restaurant chains and businesses that require people to be in proximity have been hit particularly hard as cities and factories have been shut down. If the SARS epidemic is any guide, the valuations of companies in these sectors should bounce back once the crisis is over.  Cathay Pacific’s share price, for example, nearly doubled between its 2003 nadir and its peak in mid-2004 — by which time most people were confident that the virus had been beaten. SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY ON CYCLICAL REBOUND But other industries are much harder to call. One approach is to look at those that were showing signs of a cyclical rebound just before the crisis hit and back them to resume it once the coronavirus — which has killed more than 1,000 people — loses its vigour. Semiconductor manufacturers in Asia are one such sector, according to Steven Holden, founder of Copley Fund Research, which tracks the investment decisions of 223 emerging market funds with a combined US$450 billion under management. Mr Holden’s data show that these funds had built up record overweight holdings in semiconductor stocks by the end of 2019. On average they had 7.33 per cent of their total holdings in such stocks on Dec 31, about three weeks before the extent of the epidemic became clear. Following the news of virus’s impact, their average position slipped back to 7.15 per cent of total holdings but remained at a strong 0.91 percentage point overweight relative to the MSCI emerging markets benchmark index. The most strongly bought chip companies were SK Hynix, the South Korean memory chip supplier, and three from Taiwan: TSMC, the semiconductor foundry; MediaTek, which supplies chips to wireless communications manufacturers; and Win Semiconductors, a foundry services company.   “Emerging market managers are positioned at record overweight ranges in semiconductor stocks after a surge","Feb 12, 2020",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/sectors-to-invest-during-wuhan-coronavirus-covid-19-12426378

As the,"What is BBC Future? Follow the Food Made on Earth       More Article continues below As air journeys go, it was just a short hop into the early morning sky before the de Havilland seaplane splashed back down on the Fraser River in Richmond, British Columbia. Four minutes earlier it had taken off from the same patch of water. But despite its brief duration, the flight may have marked the start of an aviation revolution. Those keen of hearing at the riverside on that cold December morning might have been able to pick up something different amid the rumble of the propellers and whoosh of water as the six-passenger de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver took off and landed. What was missing was the throaty growl of the aircraft’s nine-cylinder radial engine. You might also like: • Norway’s plan for a fleet of electric planes

In its place was an all-electric propulsion engine built by the technology firm magniX that had been installed in the aircraft over the course of several months. The four-minute test flight (the plane was restricted to flying in clear skies, so with fog and rain closing in the team opted for a short trip) was the first time an all-electric commercial passenger aircraft had taken to the skies. The retrofitted de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver took off from the Fraser River in the early morning light for a four minute test flight (Credit: Diane Selkirk) “It was the first shot of the electric aviation revolution,” says Roei Ganzarski, chief executive of magniX, which worked with Canadian airline Harbour Air Seaplanes to convert one of the aircraft in their fleet of seaplanes so it could run on battery power rather than fossil fuels. For Greg McDougall, founder of Harbour Air and pilot during the test flight, it marked the culmination of years of trying to put the environment at the forefront of its operations. Harbour Air, which has a fleet of some 40 commuter floatplanes serving the coastal regions around Vancouver, Victoria and Seattle, was the first airline in North America to become carbon-neutral through offsets in 2007. A one-acre green roof on their new Victoria airline terminal followed. Then in 2017, 50 solar panels and four beehives housing 10,000 honeybees were added, but for McDougall, a Tesla owner","Feb 12, 2020",https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200211-the-electric-plane-leading-a-revolution
18,Which Canadian Bank Stock Offers the Best Dividend? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Which Canadian Bank Stock Offers the Best Dividend?. Dividend hunting. Should you,"      Jared Seguin | February 13, 2020 | More on: CM CM It’s no secret that high-dividend-paying, blue-chip stocks are some of the safest and most lucrative investments around. Canadian banks in particular are a staple of many Canadian portfolios, but which one offers the best dividend today? Passive income and long-term growth investors in Canada are always looking for reliable blue-chip stocks with high dividend yields to park in their TFSA, RRSP, or other long-term savings instrument. Earning high-dividend payouts and reinvesting them to continue to earn even higher payouts allows an investor’s pool of cash to grow exponentially. With the immense power of compounding, even a small sum of money set aside can turn into a large nest egg over time. The top five Canadian banks have long been favourites among this group of reliable stocks due to their ironclad stability and attractive dividend payouts. The banks have also been known to generally raise their dividend distributions over time in terms of absolute dollars, so like many investment vehicles, there’s no better time than today to get invested. Picking which bank to invest in is a big decision, and the dividend yield is one very important attribute to consider when choosing a bank stock to purchase for long-term gains. As of today, among the major Canadian banks, CIBC (TSX:CM)(NYSE:CM)) offers the best bang for your buck when it comes to dividend yield. CIBC’s yield currently comes in at 5.22%. CIBC also offers a relatively cheap P/E ratio at 9.87, which is a much more attractive P/E ratio than what its banking peers offer today. There’s also evidence to suggest that CIBC can increase its dividend payouts comfortably going forward. With the highest yield among Canadian banks today and the potential for even higher yields in the future, CIBC’s stock offers a lucrative opportunity for long-term, blue-chip investors in Canada. Now, does CIBC’s yield make it an automatic buy? Not necessarily. Despite these attractive figures that make it seem like a bargain-bin pick, CIBC is also considered one of the more volatile Canadian bank stocks to own. This is mostly because of CIBC’s incredibly large exposure to the domestic housing market. The stocks for banks like TD and RBC are generally considered more stable, because their holdings are more diversified, not only in the general nature of the holdings but also in terms of","Feb 13, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/02/13/which-canadian-bank-stock-offers-the-best-dividend/

Site,"We turn to the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index for stock ideas. Here in Chicago, you're either a Cubs fan or a White Sox fan. (Given that my husband and I met at what was then called Comiskey Park, you can guess where my allegiance lies.) In much the same way, investors who favor dividend-paying stocks generally fall into one of two camps. Those investing for current income usually prefer the dividend stocks with the highest yields, which means leaning toward utilities, REITs, and consumer defensive names. Often the highest-yielding are highly leveraged, lower-quality companies. Other dividend investors are less focused on absolute yield and instead favor stocks with a history of increasing their dividends. These dividend growers are able to raise their payouts over time because their cash flows are solid--they're generally higher-quality companies. Today, we're providing some investment ideas for that latter group of dividend investors, plucking insights from the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index. The index focuses on stocks that have grown--and are poised to continue to grow--their dividends. To be included in the index, stocks must meet the following criteria: We reconstitute the index annually.  Here are the top additions from the December 2019 reconstitution, ranked by their weighting in the index. Note that we're only including stocks that our analysts actively cover.  These are the stocks in the index that were the most heavily weighted and under analyst coverage that were cut in December.  Four of the names--Johnson Controls (JCI), Hanesbrands (HBI), Kansas City Southern (KSU), and Sabre (SABR)--were let go because they broke their five-year continuous dividend-growth streaks. The indicated dividend yields on five stocks—AbbVie (ABBV), Prudential Financial (PRU), WestRock (WRK), CenterPoint Energy (CNP), and Kohl's (KSS)--landed in the top 10% of the index's investable universe at the time of reconstitution. And Maxim Integrated Products' (MXIM) payout ratio breached 75%. Only five of the 50 most heavily weighted names in the index are undervalued as of this writing.  Here's a little bit about the business strategy and outlook of each from our analysts. Chevron (CVX)
""Historically, Chevron has benefited from an oil-leveraged portfolio that has led to peer-leading margins and returns on capital.
