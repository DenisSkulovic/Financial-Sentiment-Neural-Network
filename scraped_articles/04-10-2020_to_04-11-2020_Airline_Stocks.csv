0,Has Warren Buffett Turned Bearish on Airline Stocks Such as Air Canada (TSX:AC)? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Has Warren Buffett Turned Bearish on Airline Stocks Such as Air Canada,"      Aditya Raghunath | April 10, 2020 | More on: AC Warren Buffett has one of the most successful investors in the stock market. He has built massive wealth over the years by identifying companies that are trading at prices lower than their intrinsic value but have strong fundamentals. Warren Buffett historically avoided investing in highly volatile businesses, such as technology and airlines. However, this has changed in the last few years, as Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio consists of companies such as Apple, Amazon, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. As several governments have closed their borders, airlines around the world have had to ground their flights. The travel and tourism industry has come to a standstill due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and this has decimated stock prices of companies, including Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B), Expedia, and several others. Delta Airlines has lost 60% in market value this year, while stocks of American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Air Canada are down 61%, 37%, and 62%, respectively in 2020. According to Berkshire Hathaway’s SEC filings, the company sold 2.3 million shares of Southwest Airline and 13 million shares of Delta Air Lines, generating close to $400 million in proceeds. However, the insurance giant still owns over 45 million shares of Delta Airlines and close to 50 million shares in Southwest Airlines. The sale in airline stocks by Berkshire comes as a surprise, as it bought 976,000 shares of Delta in the last week of February at an average cost of US$46.4. Delta stock is currently trading at US$23.23. While Warren Buffett has reduced his stake in airline stocks, he has not yet turned bearish on the sector. Several economists are predicting a global recession that may be far worse compared to the financial crisis of 2008-09, and this would have resulted in a decrease in holdings for Berkshire’s airline companies. The shutdown of businesses, schools, and colleges has driven consumer spending significantly lower. Unemployment rates are expected to spiral, and though governments are pumping in trillions of dollars to revive the economy, it may not be enough. If countries are able to bring the dreaded COVID-19 under control, the airline sector is unlikely to stage a quick turnaround as they underperform in an economic downturn. These companies are capital intensive, which puts a massive strain on financials. In order to cut costs, Air Canada and peers","Apr 10, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/10/has-warren-buffett-turned-bearish-on-airline-stocks-such-as-air-canada-tsxac/

2,Why You Should Consider Airline Stocks Today| 2020 | Oxford Bernard,"Investing Essentials: Airline Stocks. If you’re considering buying some airline stocks, here’s some major factors to consider…. What is the"," Oxford Bernard Leading up to COVID-19, the U.S. airline industry has been one of the best performing industries within the past decade as political and economic policies have affected the landscape.

In the business world, the economics of the airlines industry is notorious for interesting external factors that seem to attract nearly any investor ready to build or grow their portfolio. Even billionaire investor, the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffet, has portions of his portfolio allocated in the 4-largest airliners in the world. It also has a large reputation of being an elite industry – where you’ll often seen stewardesses in glamorous travel magazines, advertisements for prestigious in-flight services, credit cards that brand luxury, and pilots that are often inspirations to their friends and family. The airline industry provides transportation to passengers and cargo by aircraft. There are three components that make up the industry – commercial, general, and military.

Commercial airlines is what you would typically think of the airline industry. It is made up of airliners like Delta Airlines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), American Airlines (AA), and United Airlines (UAL) that provide commercial flights for passengers. In 2019, there were 68,948,849 tracked flights across the world. The commercial airline industry drives over a trillion dollars per year for the U.S. economy and sustains more than 11 million jobs in the U.S.

Picking an airline company can be difficult as there are things to consider. Here’s an overview of how to pick a stock to buy before jumping in too quickly. The business model is complex – there are multiple sales channels that airlines leverage in order to stream their revenues. Generally, the bulk of the airlines revenues come from the volume of flight ticket sales.

Airlines typically mold their business model in order to gain more flight ticket sales. For instance, you’ll often see airliners have their own credit cards with loyalty reward programs, so the passenger will stay loyal to their respected airliner. You’ll also notice the cabin of the aircrafts have been getting smaller since 2014. This is a strategic adjustment to add more rows in the aircraft to eventually sell more tickets. Moreover, there are four main “groups” of commercial airlines that are all competing for your business.

Network carriers are the largest airliners with the most established global route networks around major hubs across the globe. The biggest network carriers in the U.S. include Delta Airlines (DAL), American","Apr 10, 2020",https://oxfordbernard.com/airline-stocks/

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Texas-based American Airlines, like its peers, will be participating in the government airline bailout — the second this century — and there are some signs that much of the good news surrounding Uncle Sam’s generosity toward the industry is baked into the stocks. On April 6, the S&P 500 jumped 7% while AAL gained just 1.17%. Year-to-date, AAL is lower by over 56%, putting it below the performance of the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS), which is down about 51%. As noted above, airlines are onto their second bailout this century, which is a good indicator that neither the industry nor the government appears to be learning any lessons.

4,Airline cash grants offered by federal government could force carriers to take on more debt,Airline cash grants offered by federal government could force carriers to take on more debt. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"Two weeks after Congress approved a $50 Billion bailout of airlines that earmarked carriers receiving $25 Billion in direct cash grants, it turns out those grants could require airlines to take on more debt. Executives at multiple U.S. airlines tell CNBC the preliminary grant offers extended by the federal government on Friday call for 30% of the money offered to come in the form of low interest loans from the Treasury Department. The structure of the offers has caught U.S. airlines by surprise. “This is not what Congress approved,” said one industry executive who asked not to be identified given the ongoing discussions between airlines and the Treasury Department. “The aid was supposed to be $25 Billion in cash grants and $25 Billion in loans.” The cash grant offers extended to the largest airlines on Friday also come with several important provisions including no mass layoffs of airline employees through September 30th, a stipulation airlines expected as Congress was finalizing $50 billion in aid. As a result, all carriers have committed to not laying off employees for the next six months.  Another stipulation of the grant offers calls for the federal government to receive stock warrants equal to 10% of loan component in each offer. The strike price on those warrants is the price of the respective airline stocks at the close of trading on Thursday. Adding a debt component to the grant offers comes at a time when airlines have taken out loans and opened credit lines for billions of dollars. As a result, the credit ratings for many airlines have been downgraded. On Friday Fitch cut Delta’s credit rating to junk status saying, “in all, Fitch expects Delta to borrow more than $8 billion during the year, which is essential for near-term liquidity, but will raise leverage by more than a turn over prior expectations when combined with our forecasts for a smaller top line over the next several years.” Will the stipulation of low interest loans in the cash grants push some airlines to pass on the offer for billions of dollars in aid? Probably not. With airlines burning through millions of dollars in cash every day due to the worldwide plunge in demand the carriers have limited options. “I’m not sure what others will do,” said one airline executive, “we’ll keep talking with Treasury.” It is unclear how much wiggle room there is in the","Apr 11, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/11/airline-cash-grants-offered-by-federal-government-could-force-carriers-to-take-on-more-debt.html
5,How COVID-19 Is Destroying The Airline Industry | by Noah Mukhtar | Towards Data Science,,"Co-authors: Venkatesh Chandra & Ramy Hammam Airports are where we have reunions with our families, friends, and loved ones. But in 2020, a concept as simple as booking a ticket online and showing up has now turned into a life or death situation, creating the need for us to carefully plan every step and encounter, however, why wasn’t there a need to create a plan to prevent the Airline Industry from potentially collapsing in 2020? “As of April 2020, the Airline Industry is seeking more than $50b in government aid amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.” The majority of our findings revolve around the hypothesis that when one of these industries goes up, the other usually tends to go down. For example, during any pandemic, we see a rise in the healthcare industry’s performance and potential as measured through increased stock prices. In contrast, the airline industry, or in essence, any transportation industry, is almost always on the opposite spectrum as people are reluctant to mix with others due to the higher chances of infection, and as a result we see a highly leveraged industry be critically squeezed on a financial level that could lead to intense ramifications, such as bankruptcies that need taxpayers to bail them out. To give a relative comparison, after one of the worlds most catastrophic events: 9/11, revenues from the airline industry fell by only $23b, nowhere near the coronavirus’s forecasted implications of $63b to $113b. As you can see after the events of the SARS epidemic in 2004, the two industries had polar opposite trends in profit margin. To relate, the healthcare industry was booming in terms of their sales up until 2007, which was the time most countries were relieved of the backfiring effects of both epidemics, whereas airlines were still going downhill until 2008. The stability of an industry acts as a good indicator as to how much risk an investor is exposed to, with the healthcare industry having a consistent flow of profit margin that was only slightly altered by the arrival of any pandemic as seen from the years that SARS, H5N1, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and Ebola were prevalent. However, Airlines were on the complete opposite spectrum, and their profits were hit hard during the epidemics, indicating that they had a much higher sensitivity to externalities relative to Healthcare.

The markets have found a little momentum since the coronavirus sell-off,","   Thus far, the market has held its own this week. Things like Steve Mnuchin speaking about a further $250 billion in aid for small businesses, oil price moves, and varying reports on the coronavirus in New York City have all had their effects. While there are plenty of stocks to avoid right now, there are some strong picks offering nice additions to any good portfolio.  Financials may not be the hottest sector these days, but they offer some substantial value. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) remains a solid long-term asset for any portfolio. The bank now carries a 4.29% yield. Finishing 2019 with earnings of $10.72 per share, the bank carries a trailing payout ratio of 27.7%.  JPMorgan Chase is a very efficient bank. Its return on equity (ROE) was 15% last year, a rate that far outpaces the industry average of 11.76%. Over the 10-year period prior to the recent sell-off, JPMorgan Chase's shares beat the S&P 500 by 56%. Its annual net interest income growth has averaged 7.12% annualized over the past four years, bringing in $84 billion last year despite a low interest rate environment.  Annual net income growth has been even better, jumping 12.3% in 2019 to $36.23 billion. The year prior saw earnings growth of 33.14%. The value of these earnings has been amplified for shareholders, as the bank has worked to decrease its overall share count. Outstanding shares decreased 13.4% between 2015 and 2019. Coronavirus fears have put a 33% dent in the stock over the last three months, providing a nice long-term buying opportunity. A recent announcement that the bank would be temporarily closing about 20% of its branches put a little more pressure on shares.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told major airlines on Friday he wants them to repay some of the $25 billion in cash grants the U.S. Congress approved last month to cover payroll costs as airlines weather an unprecedented crisis due to the coronavirus, three industry officials briefed on the matter told Reuters. The Treasury said in a statement Mnuchin will not require passenger air carriers that will receive $100 million in payroll assistance or less to provide compensation and “funds will be available promptly upon approval of their applications.” Reuters first reported earlier on Friday that Treasury would not seek warrants from smaller regional carriers, which had urged the government not to demand compensation. Mnuchin spoke with the chief executives of major airlines in separate calls on Friday and told them the department was offering 70% of the aid in grants that would not need to be repaid, and 30% in low-interest loans for which the airlines would be required to offer warrants, the sources said. The interest rates would rise over time if airlines had not repaid them, the sources said. Three people briefed on the matter said the warrants, which would give the government the right to buy equity at a pre-set price and time, would be equal to 10% of the value of the loan. That means that every $1 billion in government aid would include $700 million in grants, $300 million in low-interest loans and an option for the government to buy $30 million in shares. Two people said the warrants would be priced at current stock prices. Any of the terms could still be subject to change as talks continue. Warrants do not generate any balance sheet debt and thus should not hamper the ability of airlines, which can also apply for a separate $25 billion government loan package, to finance in the future, experts said. Treasury said it is working with 12 passenger air carriers expected to get more than $100 million “to secure appropriate financial instruments to compensate taxpayers.” The majority of the smaller requests sought less than $10 million and Treasury is not seeking compensation in order to maintain “needed air service,” avoiding layoffs “and limiting share buyback and executive compensation.” On Sunday,","Apr 10, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-airlines-progr-idUSKCN21S1Y7

Warren Buffett’s massive stock sale suggests the Oracle of Omaha is battening down the hatches for another massive stock market drop By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. When the Oracle of Omaha speaks, you’d better listen. And Warren Buffett sent investors a clear message this week: It’s time to take profits before the stock market suffers another reversal. His holding company – Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) – revealed it had sold $30 million worth of stock, likely in an attempt to pocket the incredible gains the market has delivered over the past two weeks. Buffett unloaded 869,103 shares of Bank of New York (NYSE:BK) on April 7 and 8 to add $30.9 million to Berkshire’s cash pile. The sale relieved Berkshire of its majority holding in BK.  Bank of New York stock is still down this year, but the stock rose a whopping 28% from its March 23 lows. The sale suggests that Mr. Buffett thinks this rally is coming to an end. He’s taking his own advice to: Be greedy when the market is fearful, and fearful when the market is greedy. And the market certainly is being greedy. The Dow has rocketed higher in the past three weeks despite increasingly concerning economic data. Investors are optimistic about the chances of a v-shaped recovery despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Greedy is an understatement – and Buffett knows it.

Chapter 11's,"Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection simply means that a company is on the verge of bankruptcy but believes that it can once again become successful if it is given an opportunity to reorganize its assets, debts, and business affairs.1 Although the Chapter 11 reorganization process is complex and expensive, most companies, if given the choice, prefer Chapter 11 to other bankruptcy provisions such as Chapter 7 and Chapter 13, which cease company operations and lead to the total liquidation of assets to creditors.2﻿3﻿ Filing for Chapter 11 gives companies one last opportunity to be successful. While Chapter 11 can spare a company from declaring total bankruptcy, the company's bondholders and shareholders are usually in for a rough ride. When a company files for Chapter 11 protection, its share value typically drops significantly as investors sell their positions. Filing for bankruptcy protection means that the company is in such rough shape that it would probably be de-listed from the major exchanges such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange and relisted on the pink sheets or the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). When a company going through bankruptcy proceedings is listed on the pink sheets or OTCBB, the letter ""Q"" is added to the end of the company's ticker symbol to differentiate it from other companies. For example, if a company with the ticker symbol ABC was placed on the OTCBB due to Chapter 11, its new ticker symbol would be ABCQ.5 Under Chapter 11, corporations are allowed to continue business operations, but the bankruptcy court retains control over significant business decisions.1﻿ Corporations may also continue to trade company bonds and stocks throughout the bankruptcy process but are required to report the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 15 days.6 Once Chapter 11 bankruptcy is filed, the federal court appoints one or more committees that are tasked with representing and working with creditors and shareholders of the corporation to develop a fair reorganization. The corporation, along with committee members, creates a reorganization plan that must be confirmed by the bankruptcy court and agreed upon by all creditors, bondholders, and stockholders. Sometimes after a reorganization, a company will issue new stock that is considered different from the pre-reorganization stock. If this occurs, investors will need to know whether the company has given its shareholders the opportunity to exchange the old stock for new stock, because the old stock","Apr 10, 2020",https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/chapter11stocksbonds.asp

As the nation has been put under a 21-day lockdown in the view of the coronavirus pandemic, domestic flight services have also come to a grinding halt.

With revenues drying up, the airline announced salary cuts for its senior employees. “With the precipitous drop in revenues, the very survival of the airline industry is now at stake,” Ronojoy Dutta said in an email to the IndiGo employees in March. SpiceJet also later announced pay cuts for its staff to the tune of 10-30%. CMD Ajay Singh also took a 30% pay cut in salary for March. As coronavirus has dealt a major blow to the economy, aviation remains the worst hit industry due to lockdown, according to a FICCI report. Meanwhile, Minister of Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri took stock of the situation and said that “his heart goes out” to people who are suffering due to coronavirus. He also assured the sector that the government will lift the restrictions on the flight operations as soon as it is confident that the coronavirus situation is under control, he said in a tweet this week.

18,United Airlines stock price gains nearly 38% in one week as a bailout nears | Invezz,United Airlines stock price gains nearly 38% in one week as a bailout nears. Fundamental analysis: Major airlines awaiting multi-billion,"Shares of United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) gained more than 37% this week as the carrier attempts to stage a recovery after the stock price lost 80% of its value in around two months. All major U.S. carriers received a boost from the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said that the administration will start sending “preliminary information” to airlines about the status of their applications for government assistance on Friday.

Shares of all four major U.S. airlines recorded gains this week as they get closer to the government’s assistance. On Thursday, the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration will start providing “preliminary information” to airlines on Friday, regarding the status of their application for government aid.  “We hope to get to a lot of the airlines starting tomorrow and over the weekend with preliminary information,” Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC. Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and Spirit Airlines, all confirmed that they applied for government grants.  Grants and loans were approved as a part of the $2 trillion package approved in the Congress last week. Airlines are expected to receive grants first to avoid job cuts, with additional $29 billion available in loans to passenger and cargo airlines. “It is our objective, to make sure that I’ve said this is not a bailout, but airlines have the liquidity to keep their workers in place. So that’s the next big thing we’ll be rolling out,” Mnuchin said. It is expected that carriers will receive $25 billion in payroll grants but it is still unclear what Treasury may request in exchange for grants – warrants, options, preferred stock or other securities. United Airlines said last week that it is decreasing the number of flights from its hub in Newark from 139 daily flights to just 15 for at least the next three weeks. “While New York and New Jersey are the primary COVID-19 hotspots today, we will also watch the situation on the ground in stations all across our network and evaluate additional mitigation measures we can take in those locations as well,” Greg Hart, United’s chief operations officer. Shares of United jumped nearly 38% this week after making significant gains on Wednesday and especially Thursday, when the stock price gained almost 15% on Mnuchin’s comments.
