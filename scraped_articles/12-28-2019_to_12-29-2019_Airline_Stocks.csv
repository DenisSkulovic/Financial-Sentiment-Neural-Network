1,Ask Matt: Is American Airlines a good stock to buy? - ABC News,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"— -- Q: Is AMR, parent of American Airlines, a good stock to buy? A: When most investors think of penny stocks trading on the Pink Sheets, wind farm operators, energy drink makers and shell companies might come to mind. However, due to a vicious bear market and recession, many companies that were formerly some of the nation's most fabled firms have found themselves in this position. And one of those is the company you mention: AMR, the parent of American Airlines. AMR aamrq has gone from being an actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange to one trading for less than a dollar a share on the Pink Sheets market. Shares of AMR have collapsed as the company has pursued Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. These proceedings typically all but wipe out shareholders in the common stock, and so far, AMR has been no exception. Investors who are looking to build solid long-term value from their stock portfolio are best avoiding shares of companies in bankruptcy proceedings that are trading on marketplaces like the Pink Sheets. If you're a gambler willing to take a chance that somehow, after the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings end, there will be value, you might be willing to risk all your money. Most investors, though, should steer clear and are best sticking with shares of healthy companies that trade on exchanges including the Nasdaq or NYSE. AMR itself cautions investors: ""It should be noted that in most Chapter 11 cases, owners of equity securities receive little or no recovery of value from their investment.""

The Tell. If Boeing stock takes,"The bottom may be in for Boeing Co. BA, -0.67%  , and if so, it means one aerospace ETF could take off. Shares of the beleaguered aviation company make up 20% of the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, +0.38%, pointed out Tom Essaye, president of The Sevens Report, in a research note out Tuesday. The exchange-traded fund has gained 31% in the year to date, even though Boeing shares are up less than 5%. And Essaye thinks there’s room for Boeing to gain altitude. “I’m not a Boeing analyst,” he cautions, but lays out a strong case for upside. The decision to halt production on the 737 may have been negative for the stock in the short term, but will likely helpful in the longer term. And the stock will likely get a tailwind from the decision to replace CEO Dennis Muilenburg. “Now, Boeing enters 2020 with 1) virtually no expectations about when the 737 will come back online (increasing the possibility for an upside surprise), and 2) new leadership,” Essaye wrote. Shares of the ETF popped more than 1% on Monday after the CEO handover was announced, as noted by MarketWatch’s Mark DeCambre. But even if Boeing doesn’t rebound further, Essaye still makes a bull case for the iShares ETF. Most of what he calls the “credible” presidential candidates want to increase defense spending, which would benefit ITA. And belligerent posturing from North Korea could also benefit defense stocks.

5,Ray Dalio Holy Grail Explained - Financhill,". Ray Dalio Holy Grail Explained. How Ray Dalio Thinks About Diversification. Master Correlation, Master Investing. Here Is An Example","Ray Dalio Holy Grail Explained: Ray Dalio’s success is the type of story that drives the American Dream. As a child, he and his family lived in a middle-class neighborhood on Long Island. He started working as soon as he could, collecting tips as a golf caddy when he was just 12 years old. Even then, he had an eye on the stock market, and he collected stock tips from his golfer clients along with the cash. Dalio started investing that year, and by 1975, he was ready to enter the big leagues. He launched Bridgewater Associates from his two-bedroom apartment, and in the 40 years that followed, he grew his company to be the largest hedge fund firm in the world. Today, Bridgewater Associates manages $160 billion in assets, and Dalio has an estimated net worth of approximately $18.7 billion. Despite accruing wealth beyond his wildest imagination Dalio hasn’t forgotten his roots. He is active in a wide variety of philanthropic causes, with a special focus on microfinance and inner-city education. Through his foundation, Dalio Philanthropies, the billionaire works to give others an opportunity to pursue their own version of the American Dream. Dalio credits much of his success to a unique method of portfolio construction – one he developed after some painful lessons about diversification during his early years of investing. Traditional diversification focuses on protecting returns through the purchase of assets in different classes. For example, there might be a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash. Those who are comfortable with a high-risk/high-reward strategy focus on the equity side, while investors who need more stability increase their bond and cash holdings. The problem with this method of diversification is that it can impact returns. The safer asset classes, can’t generate the sort of income that stocks do, and they don’t increase in value at the same rate. The “Holy Grail” of investing, according to Dalio, is diversifying your portfolio in a manner that reduces risk without impacting returns. Though on the surface this strategy appears counter-intuitive, Dalio has made it work. He selects assets that have little or no correlation, without sacrificing returns. Correlation refers to the rate at which assets change in value relative to each other. Positively correlated stocks increase at the same time. However, negatively correlated stocks move in opposite directions. When one increases in value, the other decreases.

[…] We live in the 21st century and the growth of technology in the last few decades has been astronomical. With an increasing growth, most of the devices and things we use are getting smaller and smaller. A hand held cell phone has more computing and processing power than a top-spec desktop from 25 years ago. As a result, we have taken a fascination to small things in the 21st century. Our headphones, computers and dogs are all shrinking. Teacup pigs are surging in popularity. It’s no surprise that we like our investments small, too. That’s because the word “investment” seems way too big for many folks. It’s too much to learn, too much responsibility, too much risk, it’s just too much overall. Micro-investing, on the opposite hand, is simply plain adorable. ‘Snappable’, ‘Instagrammable’ and easily available at the tap of your thumb. Like a pig sufficiently small to fit inside your teacup, micro-investing is about investments sufficiently small to suit anyone’s budget. If that has got your attention (at least for a few minutes), check out this beginner’s guide to micro-investing: Micro-investing apps allow you to automatically invest small amounts of cash in stocks, albeit you recognize absolutely nothing about the stock exchange. These apps take your extra cash and funnel it into stock portfolios especially crafted for you.  Your investment money is typically used to buy “exchange traded funds“, also known as ETFs. These funds helpfully spread your risk around by buying shares in dozens or even hundreds of different companies. Don’t worry, you don’t have to suddenly start following the stock market. You don’t have to watch CNBC or read The Wall Street Journal. You can continue binge-watching “The Witcher”, “Stranger Things”, “House Hunters” or “Cupcake Wars” if you like. Here’s another plus: You don’t need much money to start out micro-investing. Literally,  all you need are five dollars to get started. The idea is to get you to start investing.

According to Guggenheim Partners’ Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, the end of this glorious bull market is getting dangerously close. By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. It’s been a bumper year for financial markets. But as a new decade moves swiftly into view, analysts are becoming understandably nervous about a potential stock market crash. The S&P 500 is up nearly 30 percent since the beginning of the year, and the Dow Jones has gained a shocking 20 percent over the past 12 months. 2019 is about to become the US stock market’s best year since 1997. But nothing lasts forever, and this decade-long bull market is almost certainly heading for a crash landing. According to Guggenheim Partners’ Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, the end of this glorious bull market is getting dangerously close. He says the Fed’s easy-money policies over the past year have helped pump markets full of liquidity. This has created an environment comparable to that of 1998, when a 45-day correction shaved nearly 20% off the S&P 500.  Minerd said the Fed’s policy has helped extend economic expansion but that a downturn is almost inevitable. The conditions in today’s market are eerily similar to 1998— inflated valuations, rising share prices, and speculative investors with an unhealthy appetite for risk. All of that is against a backdrop of low unemployment and increasing business confidence fueled by central banks’ quantitative easing.  Minerd isn’t the only one sounding alarm bells.

The Tigers assistant was still fighting his emotions when he quickly left the field after the top-ranked team in the country earned a spot in the national championship game. It was a flawless performance by LSU for those watching. What fans and the national TV audience didn't see was how LSU's offensive coordinator managed to persevere through the unthinkable sorrow of losing his daughter-in-law earlier in the day in a deadly plane crash. Ensminger was able to compose himself and call the game of his life amid the personal tragedy. LSU passing game coordinator Joe Brady witnessed Ensminger's struggles firsthand, sitting alongside him in their usual perch above the field in the coaches' booth during the game. “It definitely got emotional before the game,"" said Brady, who is also the Tiger's wide receivers coach. “I can't think of what he was able to do today with the circumstances. “It speaks to the type of man he is."" Carley McCord, Ensminger's daughter-in-law, was one of five passengers killed in a plane crash at the Lafayette (Louisiana) Regional Airport early Saturday. The plane was bound for Atlanta, and McCord planned to cheer for the Tigers in the Peach Bowl. But Ensminger — who did not speak to the media before or after the game — still helped the Tigers crush No. 4 Oklahoma 63-28 on Saturday in the Peach Bowl playoff semifinal. LSU players didn't learn of the tragedy until after the game. But anyone who had seen the news could identify with the pain on Ensminger's face when he first walked onto the field. Before LSU heads to the Jan. 13 national championship game in New Orleans, Ensminger is going home to seek comfort from family and friends. LSU quarterback Joe Burrow called Ensminger “a football guy"" and said “The best thing for him is to be around this football team.""

9,Flying low: Aviation sector struggling with overcapacity amidst economic slowdown - The Financial Express,"Flying low: Aviation sector struggling with overcapacity amidst economic slowdown. GoAir added at least 22 aircraft, and saw a 171","By Anwesha Ganguly The economic slowdown couldn’t have come at a more inopportune time for India’s aviation sector. Domestic carriers have been adding new planes rather aggressively over the past few years, as passenger growth steadily inched up over the past four years. But the slowing economic growth and poor consumer sentiment is hurting airline financials. Data from Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) showed that passengers carried by domestic airlines grew only marginally at 3.11% between January and October 2019, compared with a 20.11% growth during the same period in 2018. Weak demand, coupled with rising capacities, have forced airlines to slash fares. India’s second-largest carrier by market share, SpiceJet, posted a loss of Rs 462.6 crore in the September quarter, owing to unsustainably low fares. Margins of domestic carriers have also been impacted by higher fuel expenses. Although crude price is lower compared to FY19 levels, averaging at around $64.11/bbl so far in FY20, it is still much higher than FY18 levels, when the average was around $57.85/bbl. The road to recovery may not be very swift, analysts believe. With economic growth slipping to a six-year low in the second quarter of FY20, any pick up in passenger traffic will take a few more quarters. “Perhaps in six to nine months, once we see economic activity picking up, air passenger traffic may also see an uptick,” said aviation expert Dhiraj Mathur. Passenger load factor, a parameter for measuring capacity utilisation, also remained subdued for major domestic airlines in 2019, including IndiGo and SpiceJet. SpiceJet’s load factor dropped 80 basis points year-on-year to 90% in October, while IndiGo’s load factor was marginally higher than last year at 85.1% and GoAir’s was also down y-o-y to 83%. “Load factor dropped across airlines in October due to increase in capacity (all-time high fleet size of 616 aircraft and more to be added by year-end)… November fares so far are down around 11% year-on-year,” Axis Capital said in a report. SpiceJet added at least 34 aircraft in FY20, but saw an 84 basis points reduction year-on-year in its average capacity utilisation in April-October. Ajay Singh, chairman, SpiceJet, has been vocal about unsustainably low fares.

Last Updated at December 28, 2019 01:07 IST Vistara has partnered with Tata group company Nelco for inflight data services, which are expected to be rolled by the full service carrier shortly, according to a senior government official. Nearly five years after starting operations, Vistara -- a joint venture between Tatas and Singapore Airlines -- is also likely to be the first domestic carrier to provide inflight connectivity within India. Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash said required spectrum has been allocated for the purpose. ""Vistara has tied up with Nelco and they have taken transponder space from ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)...they had come to us for spectrum allocation which we have done. And they will be launching these services very shortly,"" he said. When contacted, a Vistara spokesperson said, ""we have not finalised this yet,"" referring to launch of the services. An email sent to Nelco seeking comments did not elicit any immediate response and the company's spokespersons were also unavailable. While airlines can offer both voice and data connectivity under the 'Flight and Maritime Connectivity Rules-2018' notified by the government in December 2018, data connectivity is expected to be offered first, Prakash said. ""There can also be voice but voice is not happening right now. Still data is as good as voice, because once you have data you can use Over-The-Top (OTT) and make WhatsApp calls,"" he noted. Regarding inflight wi-fi services, Prakash said the tariffs are not regulated by the government. ""It is for them to decide what tariff they will charge. I suppose it will be an add-on service that the airlines will offer in relation to their competitors but whether they will charge or not charge, is their decision,"" the Telecom Secretary said. Telecom pricing is currently under forbearance, and ""tariff is not an issue in this"", he added.

14,Chicago – New York Electric Air Line Railroad - Wikipedia,Chicago – New York Electric Air Line Railroad. Contents. Disambiguation[edit]. History[edit]. Background[edit]. Proposal[edit]. Inception[edit]. Building the main line[edit]. Gary and,"The Chicago – New York Electric Air Line Railroad (CNY) was a proposed high-speed electric air-line railroad between Chicago and New York City. At roughly 750 miles (1,210 km) it would have been over 150 miles (240 km) shorter than the two primary steam railroads on that route, the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad. The promoters' vision proved wildly optimistic and, in the end, only a short interurban route in the vicinity of Gary, Indiana was built and operated. It was the most ambitious of several such proposals at the dawn of electric railroading, all of which ended in failure. The term Air Line had several distinct meanings in the history of the scheme and its aftermath, and these can be confusing: The Air Line scheme was not the first proposed high-speed electric railway in the USA. In 1893 Dr. Wellington Adams promoted a 252-mile (406 km) Chicago–St. Louis route with a maximum operating speed of 100 miles per hour (160 km/h). Adams believed the new railroad could be built in a year for $5.5 million ($157 million adjusted for inflation). Trade publications ridiculed the proposal, and it went nowhere.[1] Elsewhere, global developments in electric railroading was proceeding apace at the turn of the century. In 1903, a railcar from Siemens & Halske and AEG reached 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph) on the experimental Marienfelde–Zossen military railway outside Berlin.[2] Commercial projects, however, did not progress. Proposed electric railways such as Berlin–Hamburg and Wien–Budapest proved too expensive.[3] Several interurbans in the United States had made fast demonstration runs at the same time. In 1903 an interurban on the Aurora, Elgin & Chicago Railway covered the 35 miles (56 km) between Aurora and Chicago in 34 minutes 39 seconds despite the loss of over 6 minutes in stops, and numerous speed reductions for steam railroads, trolley lines (tramways), and street and highway crossings.[4] In 1905 Pacific Electric mogul Henry E. Huntington made the Los Angeles–Long Beach run (20 miles (32 km)) in 15 minutes in a private railcar at an average speed at 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) was higher than for the projected Air Line trains.[5] Alexander C. Miller (1852–1918) had been the chief dispatcher of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad before founding the Aurora Trust and Savings Bank in his home town of Aurora, Illinois (served by the Aurora, Elgin & Chicago Railway) and establishing","Dec 29, 2019",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_%E2%80%93_New_York_Electric_Air_Line_Railroad

How A New Analytics Movement Is","Top stock picks for 2020, from some of the best portfolio managers. The stock market went on a tear in 2019. Major indexes hit numerous record highs in the second half of the year with the S&P 500 rising more than 29%. This puts it on track to be the best yearly return since at least 2013. As stocks continued to rise, Wall Street put recession fears on the back burner: The market has been boosted by the fact that the U.S. economy’s moderate expansions holds steady. Solid consumer spending, a robust labor market and now an apparent recovery in the housing market have all allayed investor fears. There has been renewed trade optimism on Wall Street as well, thanks to the signing of several new trade agreements—a revised North American trade agreement and the long-awaited phase one trade deal with China—in the closing months of 2019. Going into 2020, the market is optimistic that economic growth can continue, especially with diminishing tariff pressures and a Federal Reserve on hold.  We queried Morningstar to identify some of the best performing fund managers, all of whom beat their benchmarks both in 2019 as well as on a longer-term basis over either a three-year, five-year or ten-year period.

While topline growth has been in the double-digits, that will accelerate thanks to cost savings and revenue synergies from integrating Finisar. While $1.4 billion revenue II-VI has exposure to trade relations with China, which weighed on the stock’s performance in the last few years, a thawing in those relations will brighten its outlook.

Singapore's government is facing calls from opposition parties and a group of regional lawmakers to hold off on its yet-to-be-announced general elections, citing the health risk to voters amid the coronavirus pandemic and restrictive campaign rules. Photographer: Lauryn Ishak/Bloomberg , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Singapore has approved the use of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s coronavirus vaccine and expects the first shipments by the end of the month, by which time it also plans to move into the final phase of its virus curbs. Other vaccines are expected to arrive in Singapore “in the coming months,” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech on Monday, adding the country will have enough for everyone by the third quarter of next year. Meanwhile, Singapore will further ease restrictions to stem the spread of the virus on Dec. 28, expanding the number of people allowed to gather from five to eight. The country has set aside more than S$1 billion ($750 million) for vaccines, Lee said during the national address. “We placed multiple bets, to sign advance purchase agreements and make early down-payments for the most promising candidates,” including with Moderna Inc. and Sinovac Biotech Ltd, he said. Singapore will be one of the first countries to obtain the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Lee said. The drug has already been approved in the U.K. and Canada, and recently gained emergency U.S. authorization, marking a scientific sprint that could eventually help bring an end to a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide. Lee said first priority will be given to those who are at greatest risk: healthcare workers and front-line personnel, as well as the elderly and vulnerable. The government has also accepted the recommendation by a committee of doctors and experts to vaccinate the entire adult population, though for this to be made voluntary.
