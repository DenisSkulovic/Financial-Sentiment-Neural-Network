1,Warren Buffett Bought These 9 Stocks in 2019 | The Motley Fool,Warren Buffett Bought These 9 Stocks in 2019. The greatest long-term investor of our generation did some shopping last year..,"   There's probably not an investor on the planet who's more closely followed by Wall Street than Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett. That's because his long-term track record is unmatched. Beginning with roughly $10,000 in seed capital in the mid-1950s, Buffett has bolstered his net worth to around $89 billion, which doesn't include the tens of billions of dollars he's donated to charity over the years. Berkshire Hathaway, which has acquired around five dozen companies and is currently invested in 48 securities, has also created more than $400 billion in shareholder value for investors over the years. Suffice it to say that when Buffett buys a stock, Wall Street pays attention. According to Berkshire Hathaway's 13-F filings, Buffett bought the following nine stocks in 2019. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY CEO WARREN BUFFETT AT HIS COMPANY'S ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING. IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL. Easily the biggest eye-opener was Berkshire's purchase of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock during the first and second quarters last year. Buffett has regretted overlooking Amazon's dominant business model, which may have been responsible for around 38% of all e-commerce sales in the U.S., per eMarketer. Interestingly, though, Amazon's e-commerce and Prime membership may not be the leading driver for this company moving forward. Cloud-service provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) is growing at a much faster pace than e-commerce and is responsible for substantially higher margins than traditional retail sales. In other words, Amazon's future looks to be tied to AWS and not its online retail empire. Considering that financials comprise close to half of Buffett's portfolio holdings in terms of invested assets, it really shouldn't be a surprise that the Oracle of Omaha chose to add to Berkshire's position in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) during the first quarter. JPMorgan Chase has consistently been among the best money-center banks with regard to return on assets and return on equity, and Buffett tends to be a big fan of cyclical companies that are absolute cash machines. Buffett has even gone so far as to note that he keeps up on the happenings within the banking industry by reading JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's annual letter to shareholders. Have I mentioned that Warren Buffett likes financials? Berkshire also added to its existing position in PNC Financial Services (NYSE:PNC) during the first quarter. PNC Financial, which is a relatively recent addition to Berkshire's portfolio, generated $1.4 billion in net income on $4.5 billion","Jan 1, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/01/warren-buffett-bought-these-9-stocks-in-2019.aspx

3,American Airlines says it will share Boeing compensation with workers - MarketWatch,MarketWatch Site Logo A link that brings you back to the homepage. .mwA1{fill:#ffffff;} .mwA2{fill:#4db74d;}. Associated Press. American Airlines says it,"FORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines said Thursday it is negotiating with Boeing Co. over compensation for the airline’s grounded planes and will share some of the proceeds with its employees. American AAL, -1.73%   had 24 Boeing BA, -0.67%   737 Max jets when the planes were grounded worldwide in March after two deadly crashes. Like other airlines, American has canceled thousands of flights as a result. It estimated that the grounding will cut its full-year 2019 pretax income by $540 million. A spokesman for American said Thursday that the airline is talking to Boeing “as to what that compensation looks like.” Boeing has suggested that compensation could be in cash or other forms, such as help with training or spare parts. American expects to make part of the compensation eligible for employee profit sharing, the spokesman said without providing any figures. American Airlines Group Inc. CEO Doug Parker said in October he was confident that any losses due to the Max grounding “won’t be incurred by American shareholders, but will be borne by the Boeing shareholders.” Boeing has reached partial settlements with Southwest Airlines LUV, -0.78%   and Turkish Airlines — neither carrier disclosed details — while continuing to negotiate with others. Chicago-based Boeing has estimated the cost at $5.6 billion over several years. Meanwhile, it remains unclear when the Max will fly again. Boeing is still working on software and computer updates to prevent a repeat of crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. In both crashes, a key sensor malfunctioned and triggered an automated system to push the nose of the plane down, according to accident investigators. The Federal Aviation Administration would have to approve Boeing’s changes to the Max before the planes can fly in the U.S. Regulators in other countries plan to conduct their own reviews. Demand for private jets is expected to grow amid a collapse in global business and corporate travel. You are approaching your article limit. Get unlimited access.

4,What Type Of Shareholder Owns American Airlines Group Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAL)? - Simply Wall St News,What Type Of Shareholder Owns American Airlines Group Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAL)?. What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Airlines,"If you want to know who really controls American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership. With a market capitalization of US$13b, American Airlines Group is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors, too. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about American Airlines Group. View 3 warning signs we detected for American Airlines Group Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors own 71% of American Airlines Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of American Airlines Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in American Airlines Group. The company's largest shareholder is PRIMECAP Management Company, with ownership of 16%, With 10.0% and 9.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. On further inspection, we found that 52% of the share register is owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, It also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing.

In the backdrop of Indian airline","In the backdrop of Indian airline companies reporting huge losses in the second quarter of 2019-20, Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Tuesday that “some predatory pricing is taking place” in airfares and the government is concerned that if this continues, more airlines will shut down. He, however, ruled out any government plan to regulate fares. “The interesting thing that we have observed is that on Delhi-Mumbai route 20 years ago the average fare was of Rs 5,100. Today, the average fare is Rs 4,600. Some predatory pricing is taking place. It means people are selling tickets below their cost,” Puri told reporters. “One of our concerns is that if there is predatory pricing, then the airlines will stop functioning. This is not Air India’s problem only. Jet Airways got shut down. Before that, it was Kingfisher airline,” he said. IndiGo and SpiceJet, India’s two biggest airlines, reported Rs 1,062 crore and Rs 463 crore loss respectively in the second quarter of 2019-20. Other airlines have also reported losses in Q2 of this financial year. When asked if the minister thinks that predatory pricing is the reason for ill-health of the airlines, the minister replied, “No, there are many reasons… predatory pricing is one of the factors. But a profitability of an airline is dependent on number of things.” Asked if the trend of predatory pricing has come down after regular discussion with the airlines, he replied, “Oh yes, absolutely.” “It is constant battle. An ideal situation from an airline’s point of view is that they grow and they are also able to charge more fares. What fares they charge is their business. Our advice to them is to charge realistic fares,” he added. “It should not be too high. And it is not in your business interests if you are imposing predatory fares,” he said. When asked if the government is planning to regulate fares, the minister replied in the negative. “No regulation. It has to be done within deregulation system…. If I put a cap on fare, the airline will start charging that cap only… that cap will become the normal fare,” the minister said. “So, within a deregulated structure, we have to bring about an equilibrium,” he noted. “Government, periodically, at my level or at secretary’s level, we sit down with the main aircraft operators and tell them it is in your interest not to allow","Jan 1, 2020",https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/warning-airlines-in-india-may-shut-down-if-this-practise-continues-says-aviation-minister/1809451/
9,Tips of the Year Review 2019 -  Investors' Chronicle,"Tips of the Year Review 2019. In a strong market, our Tips of the Year have performed much better in","Our Tips of the Year needed a pick-me-up following a particularly poor showing in 2017 and a performance in 2018 that was only able to match the FTSE All-Share. Fortunately, 2019 saw major improvement, with the eight stocks selected delivering a total return of 37 per cent compared with 19 per cent from the market. The tips got off to a strong start, riding on the back of a broad market recovery that followed a sharp sell-off at the end of 2018. However, it was also the market’s hunger for shares in “quality” companies at the start of 2019 that aided our picks, as a number of the stocks selected fell into this category. This includes InterContinental Hotels, WH Smith, and the best performing Tip of the Year, London Stock Exchange, which delivered a stunning 82 per cent total return.  There was only one real disappointment from the eight Tips of the Year, which was BT. We thought a revival in the telecom giant’s fortunes could be on the cards, but it failed to materialise. In particular, as 2019 has progressed, we’ve felt dubious about the company’s decision to maintain its dividend despite balance sheet strain. That said, we have not closed out any of our BT tip or any of the other Tips of the Year over the last, which requires us to move our recommendation to a “sell”. BT was moved to a “hold” in July, though. Some of the other tips were also moved to holds after noteworthy gains.    The scores are in We measure the performance of the tips of the year from the day the tip was published rather than the price quoted in the article. We do this to try to give a better indication of the potential value of each recommendation to readers.   Despite the good run in 2019, on a three year cumulative basis the tips are still underperforming the market, which reflects the very sub-standard showing in 2017 and non-event of 2018. On a five-year basis the tips are beating the market by a decent margin, though.

Here are three reasons why a split is coming. By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the Dow’s best performer in 2019. The stock surged over 86% to hit $293. If the stock of the iPhone-maker mimics its 2019 growth, Apple could be heading for a split in 2020, six years after the last one. So far, all the stars are lining up in Apple’s favor, increasing the chances that the stock could go up further still. Even Wall Street seems to be in near-total agreement. Among Wall Street analysts, there are 23 buy ratings compared to just five sell ratings. The buy ratings have grown by four from a quarter ago. This contrasts sharply with an increase of just one sell rating over the same period, according to The Wall Street Journal. The most recent bullish comment comes from tech analyst Gene Munster of Loup Ventures. He recently stated that the stock is undervalued by over $100, meaning it could rise to over $400 should his prediction materialize. At its most recent stock split in 2014, AAPL was trading at around $650. Other stock splits have happened when the stock was valued lower (without adjusting for inflation, though). In 2005, the stock split when it was valued at $90. Two decades ago, Apple split at a price of $111.

The SEC claims that they concealed their activities 'to mislead the public regarding the share price and trading volume of BA. Consequently, the Bangkok Airways price and trading volume became inconsistent with normal market conditions.'
Share price data indicates that the airline's stock rose from Bt20.50 in mid-November 2015 to Bt25 in mid-January 2016. The company was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in November 2014.
The Bangkok Airways statement adds that the three individuals will protest the allegations to 'prove their innocence in this matter through the justice system.'
Prasert Prasarttong-Osoth, aged 85, also owns Thailand's largest private healthcare group, Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, from which he has also resigned following the Bangkok Airways stock manipulation sanctions. MENAFN0101202001630000ID1099496606  Legal Disclaimer:

16,(Tutorial) LSTM in Python: Stock Market Predictions - DataCamp,COMMUNITY. DATACAMP. Stock Market Predictions with LSTM in Python. Why Do You Need Time Series Models?. Downloading the Data. Getting,"In this tutorial, you will see how you can use a time-series model known as Long Short-Term Memory. LSTM models are powerful, especially for retaining a long-term memory, by design, as you will see later. You'll tackle the following topics in this tutorial:   If you're not familiar with deep learning or neural networks, you should take a look at our Deep Learning in Python course. It covers the basics, as well as how to build a neural network on your own in Keras. This is a different package than TensorFlow, which will be used in this tutorial, but the idea is the same.  You would like to model stock prices correctly, so as a stock buyer you can reasonably decide when to buy stocks and when to sell them to make a profit. This is where time series modelling comes in. You need good machine learning models that can look at the history of a sequence of data and correctly predict what the future elements of the sequence are going to be. Warning: Stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. This means that there are no consistent patterns in the data that allow you to model stock prices over time near-perfectly. Don't take it from me, take it from Princeton University economist Burton Malkiel, who argues in his 1973 book, ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street,"" that if the market is truly efficient and a share price reflects all factors immediately as soon as they're made public, a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper stock listing should do as well as any investment professional. However, let's not go all the way believing that this is just a stochastic or random process and that there is no hope for machine learning. Let's see if you can at least model the data, so that the predictions you make correlate with the actual behavior of the data. In other words, you don't need the exact stock values of the future, but the stock price movements (that is, if it is going to rise of fall in the near future).  You will be using data from the following sources: Alpha Vantage Stock API. Before you start, however, you will first need an API key, which you can obtain for free here. After that, you can assign that key to the api_key variable. In this tutorial, we will retrieve","Jan 1, 2020",https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/lstm-python-stock-market

Get ready for takeoff with the,"Stop-and-go traffic and hours-long commutes are a hassle. Why not fly over all that traffic? With FLOAT you will have access to Southern California area General Aviation airports. No TSA and 15-30 minute flights from one side of the city to the other. Due to federal, state, county, and local mandates to ""stay-at--home"" and eliminate non-essential travel, FLOAT has paused flight operations.

FLOAT operates at comparable prices without all of the inconveniences of driving. With different options for commuter, single flight and weekend travel, flying is both efficient and affordable. Monthly roundtrip commuter subscriptions currently start at $1,250 per month. The cost of individual flights depends on the airport you depart from, the airport you arrive at, and the distance between them, as well as local fees and charges. You can improve your commute without having to stretch your budget.","Jan 2, 2020",http://floatshuttle.com/
18,Pros' Picks: The 13 Best Dividend Stocks for 2020 | Kiplinger,Save up to 67%. Pros' Picks: The 13 Best Dividend Stocks for 2020. The bull market went into overdrive in,"Getty Images The bull market went into overdrive in 2019. The S&P 500 rushed ahead by 29% – its best showing in six years. But as much as investors will always welcome such returns, it does make it tougher to be an income investor. When dividend stocks go up in price, their yields go down. The dividend yield on the S&P 500 started 2019 at more than 2% but finished the year at 1.8%. Yes, the market keeps setting new all-time highs, but the rally that seems to never end also makes it difficult to find excellent dividend stocks with generous or even decent payouts. High-quality dividend stocks with better-than-average yields do exist, however. We're here to help you find them. We scoured the S&P 500 for dividend stocks with yields of at least 2%. From that pool, we focused on stocks with an average broker recommendation of Buy or better. S&P Global Market Intelligence surveys analysts' stock ratings and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals Strong Buy and 5.0 means Strong Sell. Any score of 2.0 or lower means that analysts, on average, rate the stock a Buy. The closer the score gets to 1.0, the stronger the Buy call. Lastly, we dug into research and analysts' estimates on the top-scoring names. Here are the 13 best blue-chip dividend stocks for 2020, then, based on the strength of their analyst ratings. 1 of 13 Getty Images The packaged food business is notoriously competitive, and even analysts who call Mondelez International (MDLZ, $55.08) a mere Hold applaud its strategy. ""The company is investing heavily back into the business and remains in the early stages of executing its playbook behind the business emphasizing reinvestment across the world and particularly behind its local jewels (local brands with strong presence in their markets), say Stifel analysts, who rate MDLZ a hold. Mondelez, which was spun off from what was then known as Kraft Foods in 2012, is an international snacks company whose brands include Cadbury, Oreo and Trident. The dividend stock has raised its payout every year since the spinoff. And while Mondelez does compete in a difficult business, some analysts are more bullish than Stifel, including Buckingham analyst Eric Larson. Larson, who rates shares a Buy with a $62-per-share price target, lauds its marketing investments and exposure to emerging markets, calling the stock ""well-positioned long-term.""
