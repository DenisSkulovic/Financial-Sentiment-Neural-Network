0,Why Airline Shares Are Higher Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Higher Today. Summer flight schedules are expanding in response to growing demand.. What happened. So what.,"   Airlines continue to add flights despite a growing number of COVID-19 cases, suggesting that they continue to see pent-up demand for travel. That, coupled with some positive news concerning the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, was enough to point airline shares higher at the open on Wednesday. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) jumped 10% at the open, while shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) opened up 9% apiece and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were each up 6% apiece. The stocks all gave back some of their gains as the morning went on, but investors on Wednesday are looking for reasons to feel positive about what has been a beaten-down sector due to the pandemic. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Tuesday marked the end of the second quarter, and airlines will be happy to put that period behind them. The industry is expected to report revenue down 90% in the second quarter due to pandemic-related travel weakness. The issues didn't end when the quarter changed, but traffic numbers are at least trending in the right direction. On Wednesday, United said it would add nearly 25,000 domestic and international flights to its August schedule as ""customers are slowly returning to flying."" More than 600,000 passengers passed through airport security checkpoints on June 29, according to the Transportation Security Administration, the first day that number exceeded 25% of year-ago levels since March 19. United's expansion is focused on leisure destinations, trying to capitalize on pent-up demand for summer vacations. And the growth, while substantial, still only restores a small part of the airline's overall schedule from a year ago. United said it would fly about 40% of its August 2019 schedule this coming August. The growth comes despite new warnings that COVID-19 is spreading in major tourism hotspots including Florida, Texas, and California, suggesting that certain states might be forced to implement new shutdowns. But the markets got good news on the vaccine front on Wednesday as well, as Pfizer's vaccine candidate showed progress in trials suggesting it was safe for use and facilitated the production of antibodies to fight the virus. Delta investors also got a fresh reminder of the risks that remain for airline investors. Delta partner Grupo Aeromexico SAB de CV filed for bankruptcy late Tuesday, likely wiping out Delta's 49% stake in the Mexican carrier.

1,United Airlines Stocks Is Beholden to Coronavirus Headlines | InvestorPlace,The Uptick of Coronavirus Cases Puts United Airlines Stock in a Holding Pattern. United Airlines is a bet on the," Like the entire airline industry, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) remains vulnerable to novel coronavirus headlines. That much was on display in late June when United Airlines stock slumped almost 12% amid reports of a second wave of virus cases.  In fact, the shares of United and other carriers are in precarious spots. In early June, United flirted with $50; yesterday it closed at $34.45. Over the past couple of weeks, investors have been hearing that several states, including prime summer tourist destinations such as California, Florida and Texas, are experiencing substantial upticks in coronavirus cases. Last week, United said it was suspending service to Myrtle Beach, S.C. because of an increase in Covid-19 cases there. Myrtle Beach isn’t a prime vacation destination, but it’s still a tourist spot. Moreover, the fact that a carrier is halting flights to a leisure destination at this time of year shows that the airlines are still being greatly affected by Covid-19. Airlines can be hurt by rising coronavirus case counts, and the industry could be weak until a vaccine is launched.  Unfortunately, a vaccine may not be administered for many months. In recent weeks, airline stocks have rebounded as the economy has reopened. With some justification,  United participated in that rally. The company restored some routes that were previously scrapped at the height of the pandemic. Specifically, it resumed flying to 150 U.S. and Canadian cities. That’s a step in the right direction. To recover fully, however,  the company’s other international routes must be restored. For U.S.-based carriers, routes to regions such as Europe and Latin America are essential because those are high-margin flights, and they’re far more lucrative than, say, flying from Los Angeles to Las Vegas or from Chicago to Denver. Prior to Covid-19, United flew to a diverse group of Latin American destinations.  But because Brazil is one of the global epicenters of the virus, many of those routes have been suspended. Brazil isn’t the end-all and be-all of any carrier’s existence. But the situation in Latin America’s largest economy is so dire that some healthcare experts and pharmaceuticals companies believe the country, along with the U.S., is one of the ideal places to test coronavirus vaccines.

2,"American Airlines Stock May Rise On Fuller Flights, But Avoid Or Sell | InvestorPlace","American Airlines Stock May Rise On Fuller Flights, But Avoid Or Sell. An easing of social distancing rules provides more"," American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock will soon feel the repercussions of its decision to largely eliminate social distancing safeguards. The company recently announced that as of July 1st it is going to begin filling middle seats and disregarding prior social distancing rules. Justification has come in the form of newly released cleaning guidelines and a partnership with Vanderbilt University.   As American sees load factors rise, Wall Street may well reward shareholders. Avoid investing in American Airlines stock as it is simply shows further signs of distress. American Airlines has recently announced it has aligned itself with Vanderbilt University,  its highly regarded hospital system and the experts working there. American’s PR hopes aside, this relationship is simply an advisory role. This changes very little for American Airlines. Guidelines and recommendations, no matter how well-respected the authority, don’t have legal weight.  Vanderbilt’s experts will simply be giving American Airlines’ management advice, which management is free to accept or reject. The company also took time to rehash measures for cabin disinfection in the same note. So, there’s really no news there. The important news is that American flights will be fuller.  American will have fuller flights come July 1. The question becomes, is this a good decision? Investors might agree that it is, but imagine yourself or your loved ones on that same plane and the calculus may change. Then again, perhaps blocking middle seats has no effect in decreasing the spread of the novel coronavirus, given the already small distance between seats. But given the resurgence of cases and the toll of human lives already seen, caution seems wise.  These are unprecedented times and American Airlines’ decision regarding social distancing rules has one of two outcomes. Shares could rise on the positive economic optics of the decision, or drop should enough investors view this as irresponsible. The most likely outcome in my mind is that markets will reward American initially. Shares will then trade higher barring any outbreak directly attributable to the company itself. But prices are going to also be subject to the upcoming earnings report which won’t be rosy.  The Allied Pilots Association asked American why it isn’t re-introducing idle fleet rather than packing flights to serve more customers. This is less profitable than packing a plane full, but if the planes are sitting idle, they could be put back online risking public","Jul 1, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/07/american-airlines-stock-may-rise-on-fuller-flights-but-avoid-or-sell/

VOLATILITY.," Air Canada (TSX:AC), as well as many other U.S. airlines, have been a hot commodity among speculative retail investors. They have a strong desire to punch their ticket to outsized near-term gains, as the world recovers from the coronavirus crisis. Indeed, the range of possibilities is ridiculously wide for the airline industry. While a favourable liquidity position and muted cash burn rate of a more financially flexibility airline like Air Canada improves the chances of surviving what Charlie Munger has referred to as a “coronavirus typhoon,” a bear-case scenario with this pandemic, I believe, leaves airline investors at risk of losing their shirts. Given some pundits are pointing to a vaccine at some point in 2021, with a potential return to (semi-)normalcy in the cards in the latter half of 2021, I’d say the odds of Air Canada stock falling to $0 is pretty low, especially after the airline’s latest moves to shore up even more liquidity. Of course, there’s always a chance that the pandemic could drag on into 2022 and beyond. Although the disruption to business will be more muted should it drag on that long, the airlines could still be in an environment where it’s uneconomical to get planes back in the skies. And the longer this pandemic extends, the closer a name like Air Canada will be to the brink. In a way, Air Canada is an all-or-nothing bet, even for long-term investors willing to hold through this pandemic. In the meantime, even the slightest bit of good news could move the needle. The stock could pop by double-digit percentage points into the green, as investors desperate for something to be optimistic about look to pile in before any sustained momentum has a chance to be generated. In the end, Air Canada is a bet on the timely arrival of a vaccine or an effective containment of the coronavirus. Warren Buffett is unwilling to place a bet on the outcome of such a binary exogenous event. Still, many other brilliant big-league investors are, including the likes of legendary fund manager Bill Miller, who’s bullish on airline stocks at these depths.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL, United Airlines UAL, Azul AZUL and Hawaiian Holdings HA. Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog: How Will Airlines Regain Lost Ground in 2H20? It is a well-documented fact that stocks in the airline space could not set the stage on fire in 2019. Headwinds like lackluster cargo business due to weak freight demand and trade tensions between the United States and China besides loss of revenues following flight cancellations stemming from the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets prevented the stocks from flying high last year. These drawbacks continued to weigh on airlines as they entered 2020. Despite the downsides, passenger revenues remained strong owing to impressive demand for air travel. Advent of Coronavirus Cripples Air-Travel Demand All the buoyancy in passenger revenues on the back of bullish demand, however, was negated by the dreaded coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on Mar 11. Even though almost all corners of the investing space have been affected by this unprecedented crisis, airlines are among the worst-hit. The fact that the Zacks Airline industry has plunged 23% since the beginning of March against the S&P 500 Index’s 3.2% gain bears testimony to the aviation industry’s severe body blow. As coronavirus claimed multiple lives apart from infecting scores across the globe, several countries were under lockdown amid wide-spread travel restrictions particularly since March, thereby causing air-travel demand to fade out fast. As passenger revenues account for bulk of the airline stocks’ top line, negligible air-travel demand spelt doom for the carriers in the March quarter. With the key component of their total revenue bases being significantly drained, heavyweights like Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines incurred massive losses in the first quarter of 2020.

EDITORS’,"Shares of US carrier American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) are trading with decent gains in the mid-$13.00s during the pre-market activity on Wednesday. Inconclusive price action is now prevailing in NASDAQ: AAL as market participants remain warry after the company recently announced it will start booking full flights starting as soon as this month. This highly controversial decision came at odds with the ongoing rising pandemic in the US, where the coronavirus advance is not giving any signs of subsiding. Furthermore, CDC’s Director Robert Redfield showed himself substantially disappointed after AAL’s announcement, adding that “We don’t think it’s the right message”. In the meantime, NASDAQ: AAL is set to continue with the erratic performance on Wednesday following Tuesday’s doji-like candle and with weekly gains so far capped in the $13.50 region. American Airlines Group Inc. is expected to reverse Tuesday’s pullback and open Wednesday’s session near the $13.50 area, trading in opposed direction to the US benchmark indices DowJones, S&P500 and NASDAQ, all of them forecasted to kick in the session on the defensive. As of writing, AAL is gaining 3.21% at $13.49 and a breakout of $14.85 (100-day SMA) would aim for $21.53 (200-day SMA) and finally $22.80 (monthly high Jun.5). On the flip side, the next support is located at $12.02 (weekly low Jun.29) seconded by $10.01 (monthly low Mar.23) and then $9.09 (monthly low Apr.23).

Discover Thomson Reuters By Noe Torres, Raul Cortes Fernandez 2 MIN READ MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican airline Aeromexico AEROMEX.MX will offer fewer flights and have fewer planes in the short term as it begins a Chapter 11 restructuring process, Chief Executive Andres Conesa said on Wednesday. Its shares plunged as much as 65.7% to record lows after the airline said late on Tuesday it had begun Chapter 11 proceedings, although losses were later pared and the stock ended down 28.5%. Aeromexico, 49%-owned by Delta Air Lines DAL.N, is the third airline to file for bankruptcy protection in Latin America, where carriers hit by the coronavirus have had less help from governments. Speaking on Mexican radio, Conesa said Aeromexico had a viable business model but needed to adjust its size. The fact that 30% of its fleet is self-owned would help the carrier obtain liquidity, he added. “We had a very healthy Aeromexico, but the impact of this crisis has been so significant that you need to transform,” Conesa told Radio Formula. “We have to prepare ourselves for the worst-case scenario, and that’s what we’re doing.” The airline said in a statement late on Wednesday it had gained court approval to continue paying employees and suppliers, honor already purchased tickets and maintain agreements with travel agencies, corporations and partner airlines. Its stock finished the day at 4.17 pesos. After the market close, Standard & Poor’s cut Aeromexico’s credit ratings to D from B- and forecast the airline would only be flying at half-capacity by the end of the year. Unions representing the Mexican airline industry expressed support for Aeromexico’s Chapter 11 restructuring process. Mexican rival Interjet has also been struggling under the burden of coronavirus-imposed travel and tourism restrictions. Latin America's two largest airlines, Chile's LATAM Airlines Group LTM.SN and Colombia's Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN, filed for Chapter 11 restructuring in May.

A Message to,"The Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are all up today after a strong jobs report for June that showed workers are starting to go back to work. Unfortunately, stocks are off the early highs during the day after the coronavirus cases across the U.S. saw another spike yesterday. TheStreet's Katherine Ross discussed breaking news in the stock market on StreetLightning with Jim Cramer. Cramer talks about buying Tesla shares after the delivery beat, a message to Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg and what American Airlines should do now. Tesla smashed its vehicle delivery forecasts in the second quarter, sending the innovative car company even higher. This led Wedbush to raise its price target from $1,000-$1,250 to $2,000 for Elon Musk's automotive company. Tesla is now the most valuable automotive company and TheStreet analyzed why Tesla shares may not be done going higher.  Cramer believes the reason why Tesla is the most valuable automotive company is because it's a tech company.  Several companies are boycotting Facebook and joining the Stop Hate for Profit campaign started by civil rights groups to pause spending on the social media giant. It's not just large corporations, as small businesses are also pausing their ad spending on the platform. What does Mark Zuckerberg think about the latest controversy with his company? Mark says he's not worried and the advertising dollars will come back. Coronavirus Market Update: Sign up for TheStreet's Coronavirus Market Update newsletter and get the latest market headlines delivered to your inbox daily. Cramer wants to let Mark know what he needs to do now to stop the bad publicity surrounding Facebook. American Airlines saw its shares pullback around 46% and TheStreet analyzed whether now was the best time to buy shares of the troubled airline. American was attempting to raise $3.5 Billion in debt financing late last month. Shares have been mixed all week after the news that they would start selling to capacity starting in July but cutting its overseas capacity by 25%.

International demand remains low. Strategic focus on partner,"View the latest information on our response to coronavirus (COVID-19) » The airline also extends its offer of no change fees for flights booked in July This article was updated on July 14, 2020 at 9 a.m. CT. “COVID-19 has forced us to reevaluate our network,” said American’s Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja. “American will have a significantly smaller international network in the year ahead, but we are using this opportunity to hit reset and create a network using the strength of our strategic hubs that we can build and grow upon and be profitable on in this new environment.” In response to the prolonged downturn in international travel, American expects summer 2021 long-haul international capacity to be down 25% versus 2019. As the airline begins planning for next summer, American will also discontinue several routes that were once popular leisure destinations but are expected to exhibit decreased demand. “American has spent the past few years right-sizing its international network, discontinuing underperforming routes while adding leisure destinations like Dubrovnik and Prague,” said Brian Znotins, American’s Vice President of Network Planning. “Now, as demand has significantly diminished due to COVID-19, we have to be nimble, creating the network that our customers desire.” American will exit several routes, including three trans-Atlantic routes from both Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) and Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). The company will also exit five underperforming routes from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to destinations in Asia and South America, concentrating on the hub’s domestic strength. As American resets its international network for future growth, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) will be the airline’s major trans-Pacific hub while Miami International Airport (MIA) will continue to be the preeminent hub for flights to the Caribbean and Latin America. Once government restrictions on trans-Atlantic flying subside, PHL will continue to be American’s primary hub for service to Europe. Earlier this year, American launched its West Coast International Alliance with Alaska Airlines, an innovative partnership to expand its international reach and connectivity for customers. The airline will plan future growth with the strength of this relationship, which includes a large presence and a strong feed in Seattle. As previously announced, American will launch service from Seattle (SEA) to Bangalore and London (LHR) next year, and Alaska also intends to join the oneworld® alliance in 2021.

The EU’s extended travel ban on American travelers will impact United Airlines more than any other carrier. By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. The EU has excluded the U.S. from the list of “safe countries” whose citizens are allowed to travel to the bloc. This will extend the ban on travelers from the U.S. to the bloc beyond July 1 as cases surge in the world’s largest economy. The ban will be painful for airlines, some more so than others. Among the big four U.S. airlines, United (NASDAQ:UAL) will take the biggest revenue hit from the EU’s travel limits. In the past couple of years, United generated nearly a fifth of its annual revenues from Atlantic flights. Europe also contributed a disproportionately larger share of profits, according to the Bureau of Transportation. Last year, United’s revenues from Atlantic flights amounted to 17% of the total. Europe contributed a similar share of revenues in 2018 and 2017. By comparison, Europe accounted for just 11% of American Airlines’ (NASDAQ:AAL) total revenue in 2019. For Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), the percentage of revenues generated on Atlantic flights was about 15% last year. Southwest Airlines’ (NYSE:LUV) international flights are concentrated mainly in Latin America. The EU travel ban is more than just a loss of revenues, though. Airlines enjoy the highest margins on international travel. The travel limits on Europe will complicate United’s recovery following the pandemic.   Europe is United’s most profitable destination and traffic source. Last year,","Jul 1, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/united-airlines-take-biggest-hit-eu-travel-ban-americans/
