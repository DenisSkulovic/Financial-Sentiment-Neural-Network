GET INSIGHTS ON ASIA IN,"Despite the smaller field, slowing demand and volatile fuel costs remain risks MUMBAI (NewsRise) -- The fall of Jet Airways has lifted shares of India's two other listed airlines to fresh highs as investors bet that the exit of a major competitor would swell profits for the rest. Not so fast, say some analysts. Capacity is rising quickly and fuel prices are so volatile that any upturn could be short-lived, HSBC Securities said recently. Airfares in India have surged 12-15% in the past four to five months as cash-starved Jet Airways, mired in losses, began to cut back on flights. Its entire fleet of 119 aircraft was grounded by mid-April, allowing rivals such as IndiGo and SpiceJet to cash in. Shares of InterGlobe Aviation, the parent of IndiGo, have surged more than 38% year to date with the stock hitting a record high of 1,716 rupees ($24.60) at the end of May. Those of the smaller SpiceJet have gained more than 46% in the same period. By comparison, the benchmark Sensex has risen 8.9%. ""The closure of Jet Airways has positively transformed the market dynamics,"" aviation consulting company CAPA India said in a note earlier this month. ""This fiscal year could mark a turning point for the sector."" With many flights at full capacity and a larger share of the market, profits for both carriers are expected to rise. For example, between January and May, IndiGo expanded its market share to 49% from 42.5%. The consensus earnings forecast for IndiGo has more than doubled since January, while that for SpiceJet has jumped 56%. Overall, CAPA expects the industry, which includes six major carriers and three smaller ones, to turn to profit for the first time since the consultancy started tracking the industry in 2003. GoAir is the now the third-largest carrier after IndiGo and SpiceJet. The latest entrant is Vistara, jointly owned by India's Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines. HSBC, however, said the sweet spot for airlines is temporary. ""Investors appear to be ignoring a number of medium- to long-term risks, which could hit profits,"" it said in a report last week. It cited volatile currencies, rising fuel prices and the strong rebound in capacity among reasons. While air travel in India has grown close to 20% each year, among the highest rates in the world, its airlines have long struggled to make a profit. Stiff competition has damped airfares","Jun 19, 2019",https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Rival-Indian-airline-stocks-rise-on-grounding-of-Jet-Airways

Shares of Jet","Shares of Jet Airways today ended higher by 93.35 per cent at Rs 54 per share on BSE after days of continuous fall on Thursday. The scrip had opened at Rs 30.20 against the previous close of Rs 33.10 and hit an all-time low of Rs 27 per share. Later the shares of debt-stricken airline recovered and rallied to touch a high of Rs 77.35 per share. On the NSE, shares of Jet Airways surged 122 per cent to settle at Rs 73.55 per share after plunging to an all-time low of Rs 26.55 in the early morning trade. Also read: Budget 2019: Indian agriculture will fly if Modi brings these reforms in agri-policy According to a market expert, the sharp rally in Jet Airways, along with few other stocks, was seen because of short covering. The shares of Naresh Goyal-founded airline had tumbled 78 per cent in the last 13 trading sessions. Jet Airways’ troubles started in 2018 when the company failed to make payments to the lenders. The airline has debt obligations of over Rs 10,000 crore to its vendors and salary dues of over Rs 3,000 crore. As the airline struggled to survive, Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal had to step down as the board members as on March 25, 2019, which was a part of the resolution plan approved by the Jet Airways board. Following this, the airline announced a temporary suspension of its operations on 17 April 2019. A consortium of 26 bankers led by the State Bank of India earlier this week took the airline to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)for the speedy recovery of their dues of over Rs 8,500 crore. The tribunal will begin hearing on the matter from Thursday. State Bank of India had said that the lenders were forced to drag the airline to NCLT as they had waited long for the resolution plan to materialise. Moreover, one potential investor in Jet Airways also demanded SEBI exemption which will work better with Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in the picture.

Comments. David"," Update: Shares in Hargreaves Lansdown (HRGV) have slumped after the UK’s largest stockbroker revealed the extent of its financial ties to embattled star manager Neil Woodford. Hargreaves slid 3% to £18.60 after the Bristol-based broker revealed nearly 300,000 of its clients were exposed to the suspended Woodford Equity Income fund, either directly or indirectly through its £8.6 billion multi-manager fund range. Chief executive Chris Hill detailed the extent of customers' exposure in a letter to Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan, disclosing Hargreaves had generated £41 million in revenue from clients' holdings in the fund over five years. That represents 2% of the broker's £2 billion revenues over the period. Its clients' total £1.6 billion exposure accounts for under 1.7% of Hargreaves total assets under administration. The FTSE 100 stayed in the red, down 40 points, or 0.5%, at 7,404, as airlines continued to drag on markets following a downgrade by HSBC analysts.  The FTSE 100 failed to take off, knocked by airline stocks which traded lower after being downgraded by bank and broker HSBC (HSBA) on weakening demand. The UK blue-chip index dipped 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7,422, after closing 1.2% higher yesterday in response to comments from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. The move down came after HSBC analysts said they expected other European airlines to follow German company Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) which issued a profit warning over the weekend. It cut its recommendations for Easyjet (EZJ) and British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) to ‘reduce’ from ‘hold’, sending the stocks down 3.2% to 872p and 4% to 439p respectively. The bank's analysts forecast weaker demand for long-haul and corporate travel demand, following the same trend seen in short-haul Europe, driven by consumer confidence and environmental concerns. Berkeley (BKG) shares fell back from early session gains, down 1.7% to £35.00, as investors became more concerned about the housebuilder reporting a 20% decline in full-year profits. ‘Overall the sector appears to be treading water, reflecting upon the political and Brexit impasse and so we continue to recommend the shares as ""hold"" for investors willing to accept medium level of risk,’ said Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre.

10,It's official: Jet Airways to go under insolvency - Business News,It's official: Jet Airways to go under insolvency. A consortium of 26 bankers had moved the NCLT to declare Jet,"Jump to navigation  The National Company Law Tribunal on Thursday admitted lenders move for bankruptcy proceedings for Jet Airways. A consortium of 26 bankers led by State Bank had taken the grounded Jet Airways to the NCLT to recover their dues of over Rs 8,500 crore. The announcement came hours after stocks of the grounded airlines surged a whopping 146 per cent today in intra-day trading, leading to the Bombay Stock Exchange seeking clarification from the company. Jet Airways, started over 25 years ago by airline-ticketing-agent-turned-entrepreneur Naresh Goyal, stopped flying on April 17 after it ran out of cash and the unpaid lessors took away most of its 100-odd operational airplanes. The lenders have been trying to sell the airline as a going concern since the past five months but failed due to many a reason. Apart from banks, the airline also owes over Rs 10,000 crore to its hundreds of vendors, primarily aircraft lessors and over Rs 3,000 crore to around 23,000 employees who have not been paid since March. The airline has been having negative net worth for long and has run a loss of over Rs 13,000 crore in the past few years. Thus it has over Rs 36,500 crore of dues and being a services company negligible assets to recover. Also, most of its domestic airport slots have been given away to other airlines by the government and so are some of its slots at some key international airports. On the airplane asset side, Jet had only 16 on its book which are valued around Rs 5,000 crore as per some media reports, as the rest of its 123 fleet were on lease and most of them have been de-registered or taken away by the foreign lessors already. Following a meeting of the lenders Monday, SBI had said that ""after due deliberations, the lenders have decided to seek resolution for Jet Airways under the bankruptcy code since only a conditional bid was received"". The statement further said the move was necessitated as the prospective investor (a consortium of Etihad Airways and Hinduja group) wants some Sebi exemptions waiving the open offer requirement, which can be worked out better under the bankruptcy laws. Two operational creditors--Shaman Wheels and Gaggar Enterprises-- had already taken the airline to the NCLT on June 10.

12,"Beyond Meat has had a mega rally, but IPO euphoria might not last","Beyond Meat is now larger than 80 S&P 500 companies, but IPO euphoria might not last. MORE IN TRADING NATION.","Beyond Meat has blown up. Since going public in early May, the stock has raced nearly 600% higher, taking its market cap above $10 billion. The plant-based meat company is now larger than 80 S&P 500 companies, including Macy’s, Xerox and Mylan. While Beyond Meat is by far the market’s biggest IPO success story this year, it’s not the only one. Other recent debuts, including Zoom Video, Revolve Group and PagerDuty, have blasted higher since their floats. After such a massive run for these companies, Miller Tabak equity strategist Matt Maley is growing worried a top is forming in the hot IPO market. “There’s no question there is froth in the IPO market and that could continue for a while. But there are reasons to be concerned,” said Maley on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “The number of stocks that were unprofitable in the 12 months leading up to their IPO is back to levels that we saw back in the bubble of 2000.” Some of the highest-profile IPOs this year, such as Beyond Meat, Lyft and Uber, are companies without profit. Beyond is not projected to generate quarterly income until the third quarter of 2020, according to FactSet estimates. “Also, the IPO ETF has outperformed the S&P by quite a bit over the last few years. It’s up over 100% since early 2016, which is up almost twice as much as the S&P,” said Maley. The Renaissance IPO ETF, which holds stocks that have gone public within the past two years, is up nearly 38% this year, while the S&P 500 has added 16%. “But, the thing that concerns me the most is that a lot of these companies are not brand-new companies like they were back in the last bubble. They’re companies that have been around for quite a while, and when smart people sell their company or take them public it’s usually a sign of a top,” said Maley. For example, Goldman Sachs had its IPO in mid-1999 before the bubble burst a year later, says Maley. Similarly, he notes Blackstone debuted in 2007 before the financial crisis. Beyond Meat, in particular, could soon come back down to earth after its mega rally, says Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Butcher Joseph Asset Management. “I worry about valuation,” Tengler said during the same “Trading Nation” segment. “At some point, enthusiasm will wane [for Beyond] and this will","Jun 19, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/beyond-meat-has-had-a-mega-rally-but-ipo-euphoria-might-not-last.html

14,"Hedge Funds Have Never Been This Bullish On Pluralsight, Inc. (PS)",. . . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY.,"                                                   Most investors tend to think that hedge funds and other asset managers are worthless, as they cannot beat even simple index fund portfolios. In fact, most people expect hedge funds to compete with and outperform the bull market that we have witnessed in recent years. However, hedge funds are generally partially hedged and aim at delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns rather than following the ups and downs of equity markets hoping that they will outperform the broader market. Our research shows that certain hedge funds do have great stock picking skills (and we can identify these hedge funds in advance pretty accurately), so let’s take a glance at the smart money sentiment towards Pluralsight, Inc. (NASDAQ:PS). Pluralsight, Inc. (NASDAQ:PS) investors should be aware of an increase in support from the world's most elite money managers in recent months. PS was in 30 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2019. There were 15 hedge funds in our database with PS holdings at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that PS isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds. So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017.

15,Embraer Nabs Yet Another Regional Jet Order in the U.S. | The Motley Fool,Embraer Nabs Yet Another Regional Jet Order in the U.S.. The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer has taken the U.S. regional airline,"   Embraer (NYSE:ERJ) found itself in a sticky situation entering 2013. The Brazilian aerospace company delivered 106 commercial jets during 2012, yet it ended the year with a backlog of just 185 firm orders for its E-Jets. Typically, commercial aircraft manufacturers like to have several years' worth of production lined up in their firm backlogs. However, since then, Embraer has capitalized on a wave of aircraft replacements in the U.S. regional airline sector. This has enabled it to keep output steady as it transitions the bulk of its production to its next-generation E2-series jets. Embraer continued its roll of success at this week's Paris Air Show, as United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL) ordered more E175s. Since the middle of 2013, Embraer has delivered just over 400 E175 jets to regional airlines operating for the four major U.S. airlines that have regional affiliates. During the same period, Bombardier -- its only current competitor in the market for large regional jets -- has delivered just 113 new regional jets in the U.S. Success in the U.S. regional airline sector has kept Embraer afloat recently. Over the past six years, more than two-thirds of deliveries for its E-Jets family have gone to U.S. regional airlines. Meanwhile, Bombardier was forced to cut output of its CRJ family jets from an average of 50 per year between 2014 and 2016 to just 26 jets in 2017 and 20 last year. U.S. REGIONAL AIRLINES HAVE ADDED HUNDREDS OF E175S TO THEIR FLEETS SINCE 2013. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. Embraer's order advantage has been growing in recent years. Looking forward, Embraer ended the first quarter with 171 firm orders for E175s in the U.S. market, largely thanks to a deal for 100 E175s with Republic Airways that was finalized late last year. By contrast, Bombardier had just 27 remaining firm orders from U.S. airlines for its competing CRJ-900 as of the end of the first quarter. On Monday, Embraer announced that United Airlines had placed a new firm order for 20 E175s, to be operated in a spacious 70-seat configuration by the airline's regional partners. United also has options for an additional 19 E175s. The first aircraft under this deal will be delivered in the second quarter of 2020. This sale keeps Embraer's backlog looking quite solid for the next few years. As of the end of the first quarter, Embraer had firm orders for 206 current-generation","Jun 19, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/19/embraer-nabs-yet-another-regional-jet-order-in-us.aspx

and suggesting the Taser manufacturer is facing potential downside between 40% and 60%. In addition to the Taser, Axon offers analytics services to law enforcement via officer body cams. Yet Spruce Point said Axon's business and stock present a number of problems.   “With a history of SEC inquires, delinquent filings, and material weaknesses, we believe Axon will shock investors with significant earnings disappointment and increasing cash burn as it fails to scale beyond these niche businesses,” the short report said.  Axon has a greater exposure to Chinese tariffs than the company has suggested, according to Spruce Point. The firm also said the Taser has limited domestic growth opportunities — and software and sensors growth is slowing. The Taser's first-mover advantage since the launch of the Taser 60 program in 2014 is eroding, and Axon burned through a record amount of operating cash in the first quarter, the short seller said.

However, Spruce Point has unearthed 401k plan filings at the IRS where Axon admits errors dating back to 2014.""  In an email to Benzinga, Axon fired back against the allegations in the report. “Spruce Capital put out a poorly researched report that is riddled with inaccuracies and innuendos. While short sellers seek to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt in hopes of knocking our stock down to make a short-term profit, Axon is focused on long-term solutions such as making the bullet obsolete, improving police-community relations and enabling a fairer justice system,” an Axon spokesperson said. So far, it seems like the market is skeptical of Spruce Point’s claims: Axon shares were trading higher by 3.67% at $68.46 at the time of publication Wednesday.
