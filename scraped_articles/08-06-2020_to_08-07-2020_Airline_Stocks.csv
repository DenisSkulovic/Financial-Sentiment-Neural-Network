1,Forget Airline Stocks -- This Aircraft Leasing Stock Is a Better Buy Right Now | The Motley Fool,Forget Airline Stocks -- This Aircraft Leasing Stock Is a Better Buy Right Now. Here's a way to invest in,"   It's been a tough year for the airlines, and for the multitude of industries that rely on aviation for revenue. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global travel demand to plummet, and it will likely take years before the industry fully recovers. The stocks look cheap, with most airlines and major suppliers including Boeing (NYSE:BA) off 50% or more year to date. But the risks are real. The airlines are bleeding through millions per day and expect to continue doing so into 2021. I believe aviation will eventually recover, and I'm personally comfortable accepting the risk and buying into a few of the top names in the industry and hoping for the best. But for those who are interested in betting the industry will recover without taking on the risk associated with owning an individual airline, AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) is a name to add to the watchlist. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. AerCap is in the business of buying planes from manufacturers and leasing them back to customers, a model that has gained popularity among airlines in recent years as the carriers try to shrink their liabilities and gain fleet flexibility. AerCap owns 1,357 planes leased to airline customers around the globe. Aircraft lessors by their nature carry a lot of debt, and can end up in a precarious position when the aviation market heads south. The markets have assumed the worst, with AerCap shares falling 75% from Jan. 1 this year and, even after a slight recovery, still down more than 50% in 2020. COVID-19 has taken its toll. AerCap has provided many customers with rent deferrals to help them through the crisis, and those deferral requests are likely to continue in the months to come. But what the market has missed is that AerCap is well-positioned to manage through the crisis. As of June 30, AerCap's deferral balance was $430 million, or about 9% of total revenue. AerCap has about $1 billion in security against that amount in case it is never recovered. On a late July call with analysts, CEO Aengus Kelly said management is seeing a slowing of deferral requests in both Asia and Europe, which together account for more than half of total company revenue. The United States market continues to struggle, but AerCap's global diversification should serve it well.

2,Why Shares of American Airlines Rose Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of American Airlines Rose Today. There's a lot of reason for hope in the current news flow surrounding,"   Thursday was a good day for airline stocks, and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) led the sector higher. American closed up 3.8%, and traded up as much as 5.8% mid-day, on a loosening of international travel restrictions and continued hope airlines might be included in a second round of stimulus coming out of Washington. It's been a tough year for the airline industry, with COVID-19 squelching travel demand and causing companies to scramble to cut costs. The airlines saw revenue in the second quarter fall by 80% or more year over year, in part because the U.S. and other nations limited international travel to try to stem the spread of the virus. COVID-19 is still a problem, but some of those regulations are beginning to be rolled back. The U.S. State Department on Thursday lifted its Global Level 4 Health Advisory warning U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP. The change in designation is unlikely to open a demand floodgate, as U.S. citizens are still limited in the international destinations they can travel to due to the country's continued issues with the pandemic. Most large corporations are limiting employee travel, especially international travel, and few tourists are likely to venture out in the current environment. Still, the move is a step in the right direction. Airlines are also moving higher on fresh talk that lawmakers are open to including another round of payroll support in a second stimulus plan. As part of the CARES Act passed earlier this year the airlines received $25 billion in grants and loans to help cover payroll during the pandemic, conditioned on the industry conducting no layoffs before Sept. 30. Airline shares spiked higher on Wednesday after a group of Republican senators reportedly backed extending an additional $25 billion in support to airlines in return for extending the layoff ban. Later that day President Donald Trump expressed support for the new stimulus. The news has all airlines in the green, but American likely led the way because it is considered the most vulnerable among major carriers due to its industry-high debt load. American was also the most aggressive in using the payroll support to add back flights and try to capture whatever revenue was out there to be had. There is a lot of positive news concerning the airlines right now, but investors need to be cautious not","Aug 6, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/06/why-shares-of-american-airlines-rose-today.aspx
3,Airline Stocks Are Rallying Because More Bailout Help Appears to Be on the Way | Barron's,Airline Stocks Are Rallying Because More Bailout Help Appears to Be on the Way. . . Airlines are racking up,"    Political support is building in Washington for another airline bailout package and the stocks were rallying on the news. American Airlines Group (ticker: AAL) rose nearly 9.5% Wednesday and extended those gains on Thursday, adding 3.4%. United Airlines Holdings (UAL) was up 1.2% Thursday after gaining 4.5% on Wednesday, while Delta Air Lines was up 2% following a 3.1% gain the day before. The NYSE Arca Airline Index was ahead 2.6% on Thursday. Airlines have already tapped up to $25 billion in payroll support under the Cares Act, passed into law on March 27. That funding expires on Sept. 30, and airlines have signaled plans to cut more than 76,000 jobs in October, after they lose federal support. A measure now in Congress would extend the Payroll Support Program (PSP) for another six months, potentially preserving thousands of jobs until March 31, 2021. A group of 16 Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer on Wednesday, urging approval of another $25 billion in payroll funding for the industry. President Donald Trump added his support, saying at a news conference, “I think it’s very important that we keep the airlines going...we don’t want to lose our airlines.” Support for more airline aid also seems to be building in the House of Representatives. A “dear colleagues” letter signed by Democrats and Republicans in July urged approval of $32 billion in new funding for the industry. “With the resurgence of Covid-19 in several states…and a vaccine for the virus yet to be developed, passenger demand for air travel will not recover before the PSP expires on September 30,” the letter said, according to RollCall. “Without an extension of the PSP before then, hundreds of thousands of airline workers will be fired or furloughed on October 1.” Airlines could use the cash. All are racking up operating losses as air travel remains depressed, down more than 75% from last year’s levels. The resurgence of the virus and state quarantine measures have stalled a recovery, prompting airlines to retrench, trimming their flight schedules for August and September, and making plans for deep capacity and job cuts this fall. The new funding probably won’t be free, though. The original PSP consisted of 70% in grants and 30% in loans that had to be repaid in the form of stock warrants to the U.S. Treasury (diluting airlines’","Aug 6, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-stocks-bailout-congress-payroll-support-travel-51596739531

6,The day I dumped all my Airline stocks – Theory of Constraints,The day I dumped all my Airline stocks. Share this:. . Related. Portfolio refocus towards retail and hospitality sector. Mid-Year,"Theory of Constraints Identify, Exploit, Subordinate, Elevate, Repeat 2 days ago, I dumped 2 prominent Asian airline stocks — Singapore Airlines (C6L) on SGX and Cathay Pacific Airways (293) on HKEX. It is a late move on my part due to expectations of possible recovery towards the end of the year. However with the onset of second wave and even third wave for COVID-19 in some countries, I strongly believe that it is a move that is better executed now than never.  Both SIA and Cathay had recent rights issue (Jun and Jul respectively) as part of a rescue plan to stay afloat during this critical period. I had subscribed earlier to SIA rights, to prevent dilution of my holdings and a possible revival of international travel in the latter half of the year. However, in the month of July when Cathay opened up for subscription of its rights, I decided not to go ahead due to the third wave in Hong Kong and internal (HK-China) / external (USA-China) tensions. I foresee these uncontrollable factors to worsen the situation for Cathay. With little to no leisure travel expected and low level of business travel (meetings could still be largely held virtually), coupled with safe distancing measures within the aircraft (one seat part or even empty row in between) leading to higher ticketing pricing, profits-taking would not be any time soon. Ignoring capital gains, I doubt travel business will pick up to the point of dividends issuance for the next 2 or 3 years. Looking at the YTD charts, both have been on a steady downtrend. For investors who feel that these are value-buys or bargains, do be careful of falling for the “too cheap to be ignored” tags. You would probably need a very long time horizon to even see some reasonable returns. The investment amount redeployed in other counters would more than probable see better returns in the same time period or even lesser. One good point to note is that both Singapore and Hong Kong lacks domestic market demand, or intra-country travel. In comparison the hospitality sector (e.g. hospitality REITs), unlike airline businesses, does not fully depend on business from international travel. From what I observe in Singapore’s context, hotels have the saving grace from government agencies for isolation purposes, companies that required their Malaysian workers to stay in Singapore (due to Malaysian movement control order), and","Aug 6, 2020",https://toc.net/2020/08/06/the-day-i-dumped-all-my-airline-stocks/
7,Should You Face the Fiscal Cliff Head-On With LUV Stock? | InvestorPlace,"Is Southwest Airlines the Safest Bet on Airline Stocks?. As airlines beg for mercy, investors can buy LUV stock on"," Source: Eliyahu Yosef Parypa / Shutterstock.com Few industries represent what I call America’s “bailout culture” more than the airlines. After one round of stimulus during the novel coronavirus pandemic, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is representing the industry in asking for another one. LUV stock investors are, naturally, watching to see how this beg-a-thon develops.  The company’s CEO, Gary Kelly, recently asked the U.S. government for an extension of its financial support of the airline industry. In doing so, Kelly spoke on behalf of not only Southwest Airlines, but other U.S.-based airlines as well. There’s a lot at stake here, especially for anyone employed by an airline. Yet there’s also much to consider for current and prospective investors in LUV stock. Does Southwest’s desperation mean that it’s time to give up and sell one’s shares or simply avoid the stock altogether? Or, is it a bold and potentially lucrative strategy to “buy on fear” in anticipation of better times ahead? Crazy or brilliant, this could be the “desperation trade” that contrarians have been waiting for. One feature of LUV stock that should capture any value-focused investor’s attention is its trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 101.28x. Personally, I would expect to see a high-flying tech stock having a triple-digit P/E ratio, not an airline stock during a pandemic. But, strange times make for strange numbers. As low as the price of LUV stock is, evidently the earnings per share have been much lower than that — hence the high P/E ratio. This actually makes sense since U.S. airlines haven’t been generating much in the way of revenues this year. As for the price of the stock, Southwest Airlines traded slightly below $31 at the end of July. That’s a pretty deep discount compared the the stock’s 52-week high price of $58.83. So, is LUV stock a discount or not? “Discount” probably isn’t the right word for it. “Fixer-upper” might be the better descriptor. And as real-estate investors know all too well, fixer-uppers take time and patience, though the eventual payoff can make it all worth it. While LUV stockholders might be running out of patience, America’s airlines are definitely running out of time and money. The $25 billion that the airlines received through the CARES Act won’t likely last much longer. Without another round of financial support from the government, the next likely step for the airlines would be layoffs and","Aug 7, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/southwest-airlines-luv-stock-safest-bet/

BTC-USD.,"                                                   American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock remains down nearly 60% for the year. But to be clear, it could be a lot worse. And that is creating some sentiment that AAL stock could be a contrarian bet. Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com I don’t think that’s an apt assessment of the situation. The definition of a contrarian investor is that they buy when others are selling and vice versa. However, when it comes to American Airlines, investors are buying the stock. In fact, all of the big four U.S. airlines have bounced off May lows. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is up nearly 70%, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is up nearly 40%, and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is also up nearly 40%. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AAL stock as of this writing is also up nearly 40%. This tells me that investors aren’t ignoring AAL stock, even though that it might be a good idea to do so. 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand When you look at airline stocks over the last 12 months, a similar picture emerges. American, United, and Delta are down 56%, 61%, and 54% respectively. Only Southwest’s stock at price is less than 50% off its price of 12 months ago. As a result, investors may believe that investors find no clear winner, or loser, among the airline stocks. Investors are clearly not blaming any one airline for the pandemic. But that doesn’t mean they agree every airline will come out of this well. Airline stocks were up briefly in early August because airline traffic had topped the 700,000 mark for five consecutive days. While nobody ever thought 25% of year-over-year traffic would be reason to celebrate, airlines will take what they can get. This got me thinking about how the big four were performing at this time last year. AAL stock was the only one not to be positive for 2019. This is a reminder that while investors may feel American’s stock dropped too far, they are likely to be less bullish on the way back up.

Enter,"      Joey Frenette | August 6, 2020 | More on: AC CJT Commercial airline stocks are in the doghouse, with their exorbitant cash burn rates and weakening financial footing that will only worsen the longer the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. Warren Buffett clearly isn’t a fan of U.S. commercial air travel companies in the era of the coronavirus. While Buffett may be proven wrong for selling them at a loss during the worst of the coronavirus sell-off, one thing is certain about the airline stocks at this juncture: they’re far too speculative given the wide range of possible outcomes with this pandemic. As such, it doesn’t matter how profound the upside could be for the airlines on the advent of an effective vaccine. If there’s a chance that a stock could implode to zero in a bear-case scenario, the stakes are far too high to consider it as a sound investment rather than a speculation. Not all airline stocks are duds, however. Cargo-carrying airlines like Cargojet (TSX:CJT) have been surging to new heights amid the pandemic thanks in part to increased demand for overnight shipping services. The pandemic is the perfect storm of headwinds that threatens the future of airlines that transport people. However, for the airlines that are in the business of transporting goods, the pandemic is a huge tailwind. Cargojet is now up a whopping 120% from its March bottom, a time that I urged investors to get greedy with the stock, having initially sold off alongside almost everything else in the February-March stock market crash. “Although the name is pretty expensive at 68 times next year’s expected earnings, I’d argue it’s far better to pay up for a resilient name that isn’t dependent on the outcome of an exogenous event for its survival. Cargojet is riding on a secular e-commerce tailwind and will continue to fly high, as its commercial peers grind to a halt,” I wrote in a prior piece, touting Cargojet as a better buy than Air Canada (TSX:AC). While Air Canada may have more upside than Cargojet in a bull-case scenario that sees the timely arrival of a COVID-19 vaccine, you’d still need to get lucky to make money on the name. That means Air Canada is a speculation, whereas Cargojet is an investment that will likely continue flying higher amid this pandemic.

A group of 16 Republican,"   The CARES Act, passed in March, offered $25 billion in aid to help airlines pay employees’ salaries amid the COVID-19 pandemic provided that they refrained from laying off staff. However, with these conditions set to expire at the end of September and air travel still vastly reduced, airlines have raised concerns that they will need to cut tens of thousands of jobs in October if nothing is done. “For these reasons, we support a clean extension of payroll support for passenger air carrier employees included in the CARES Act to avoid furloughs and further support those workers,” the senators wrote in a letter to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer. Aside from being a victory for labour unions, the announcement also had a curative effect on airline stocks. Shares in American Airlines traded as much as 12% higher on Wednesday before closing at 9.5%, while United Airlines and Delta Air Lines respectively rose by 4% and 3%. Also affected were Boeing, whose shares rose by 5.6%, and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, whose shares rose by almost 9%. The Senate letter also called for further congressional support to prop up other aspects of the air travel industry: “With air travel anticipated to remain low in the near future, Congress should also consider provisions to support and provide flexibility for businesses across the aviation industry similarly impacted, such as airport concessionaires and aviation manufacturing.” Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, hailed the letter as a demonstration of “overwhelming bipartisan majority support” for a six-month extension of the payroll aid programme.  10 Types of Financial Market That Future Investors Should Know Tesla Prepares for Heavy Trading Ahead of S&P 500 Debut The Changing Role of the Office in Modern Businesses    You must be logged in to post a comment.

Apple,"Katherine Ross  Airline stocks--including American Airlines, Delta and United--got a boost after a Reuters report that suggested lawmakers are looking to offer billions more in payroll assistance support to the beaten-down sector. Reuters reported that 16 Republican Senators have backed a plan that would extend the $25 billion of payroll assistance already in place beyond the current September 30 deadline. This came after Reuters saw a letter signed by, among others, Colorado's Corey Gardner and Florida's Marco Rubio. Last week, the International Air Transport Association, an industry lobby group, warned it would take until 2024 for global airline passenger traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels, while June data showed the lowest 'load factor' data in industry history.  President Donald Trump has said that he's in favor to give airlines $25 billion more.  However, Jim Cramer said that this aid will not be enough to stop the mass layoffs and furloughs that the airline industry is facing in October.

IYT Short-Term Chart (2018,"The Dow Jones Transportation Average rallied to a five-month high this week, underpinned by bullish sentiment in reaction to COVID-19 curve-flattening across the Southern and Southwestern states. Package delivery services are leading the advance, with United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) surging to an all-time high. A steady airline bounce is also supporting the upside, after TSA reported the strongest air travel numbers since the pandemic began in the first quarter. Transport price action often predicts economic strength and weakness, with shipping volumes increasing in good times and decreasing in bad times. Many truckers are now trading near new highs, highlighting the resumption of commercial and industrial activity needed to support a full recovery in 2021 and beyond. Even so, sector performance has gotten ahead of actual metrics, with many U.S. businesses reporting steep second quarter revenue declines. Railroads are the wild cards in this equation, with Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) and CSX Corporation (CSX) now lifting toward June resistance. This transportation segment is more dependent on the energy industry than other components and will be affected if the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract rolls over in the lower $40s and heads down to levels struck during a historic decline that posted a negative number at the April low. The transportation sector is a category of companies that provide services to move people or goods, as well as transportation infrastructure. The transportation sector consists of several industries including air freight and logistics, airlines, marine, road and rail, and transportation infrastructure.  The iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT) came public in the low $50s in 2003 and entered a strong uptrend that ended near $100 in 2008. The fund fell to an all-time low during the economic collapse and turned higher into the new decade, completing a 100% retracement into the prior high in the second quarter of 2011.

16,"GOP senators, Trump back more aid for airlines as elections near | Aviation News | Al Jazeera","GOP senators, Trump back more aid for airlines as elections near. US Congress to vote on COVID aid package after","Republican senators support more relief aid for airlines that have warned of possible layoffs a month before elections. A group of 16 Republican senators has endorsed giving more money to airlines to avoid layoffs right before United States elections in November, giving a boost to a lobbying effort by airlines and their unions. In a letter to Republican and Democratic leaders, the GOP senators did not specify an amount on Wednesday, but a proposal by several airline unions would give the hard-hit aviation industry $32bn, including $25bn for passenger airlines. Late on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump also expressed support when asked about the senators’ letter. “We don’t want to lose our airlines so if they’re looking at that, whether they’re Republican or Democrat, I’d be certainly in favour,” Trump said at a White House briefing. Airline stocks rose. American Airlines, viewed as the most financially troubled among the major airlines, gained the most, closing up 9.5 percent. The senators said they support relief because air travel remains depressed and several airlines have warned of possible job cuts on October 1, when a prohibition on airline layoffs expires. They said Congress should also consider more help for airport concessionaires and aircraft manufacturers. In March, aviation companies got $32bn to help cover payroll costs for six months in exchange for not laying off workers. Nine of the 16 GOP senators who signed the letter are up for re-election in November and could be hurt by headlines about thousands of airline furloughs the month before voters go to the polls on November 3. Some of those senators face difficult re-election races, including Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado. Others represent states with large numbers of airline workers, such as John Cornyn of Texas. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky made no provision for airline workers in his $1 trillion proposal for additional virus relief. A spokesman for McConnell had no comment. A majority in the House, including more than two dozen Republicans, have endorsed the spending. The Treasury Department has so far declined to comment on the Trump administration’s position. No US legislators have spoken out against the airline provision, although aides said some object to helping workers in one industry when there are millions of other workers who have already lost their jobs during the pandemic.

Cantech Letter founder and editor Nick Waddell,"   Wishpond begins trading BBTV sees Insider Buying Is Burcon Nutrascience still cheap?      Second quarter results coming in better than expected for Air Canada (Air Canada Stock Quote, Chart, News TSX:AC) but it’s the company’s new plan of action that’s impressing Paradigm Capital analyst Corey Hammill.  The analyst reviewed Air Canada’s quarter in an update to clients on Tuesday and kept his “Buy” rating and $30.00 target, saying the airline is transforming into a long-term sustainably profitable business. Montreal-headquartered Air Canada delivered its Q2 financials on July 31, with the overall quarterly revenue down a massive 89 per cent year-over-year and total passengers carried dropping by 96 per cent compared to Q2 2019. Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu said the COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating and that Canada’s federal and inter-provincial regulations in response to the health crisis have further hobbled the airline. Rovinescu pointed to a number of steps taken by management, including the raising of $5.5 billion in new equity, debt and aircraft financings since mid-March (putting the company at over $9 billion in liquidity as of June 30), a major management and front-line workforce reduction, a $1.3-billion reduction in fixed costs and capital investments, the permanent retirement of 79 aircraft and the indefinite suspension of some domestic routes and station closures.  “These were some of the painful but necessary steps we have taken to stabilize our airline and preserve cash in these uncertain times. We will now look to the future using this unprecedented challenge as an equally unprecedented opportunity to rebuild a smaller but even more nimble airline, with a simplified and younger fleet and a lower cost structure coming out of the crisis,” Rovinescu said in a press release. On the Q2, Air Canada managed revenue and EBITDA of $567 million (down from $4.7 billion for Q2 2019) and negative $832 million (down from $916 million a year ago), whereas Hammill was calling for revenue of $537 million and EBITDA of negative $1.6 billion. Hammill reported the news that the IATA recently revised its forecast on air travel recovery, which it now says will occur in 2024, while Air Canada’s management has said it’s expecting the recovery to take three years.  Despite these headwinds, Hammill says he’s “cautiously optimistic” in his long-term outlook for AC. “The business has been rebuilt to withstand shocks, which is","Aug 6, 2020",https://www.cantechletter.com/2020/08/is-air-canada-stock-undervalued-right-now/
18,Exclusive: Republican senators back extending US$25 billion payroll aid for US airlines; shares jump - CNA,. . . . . . . . . . Exclusive: Republican senators back extending US$25 billion payroll aid for," A group of 16 Senate Republicans on Wednesday backed extending a US$25 billion payroll assistance program for U.S. airlines who have warned they may be forced to cut tens of thousands of jobs after Sept. 30 without government action, according to a letter seen by Reuters. WASHINGTON: A group of Senate Republicans on Wednesday backed extending a US$25 billion payroll assistance program for U.S. airlines after warnings that carriers may be forced to cut tens of thousands of jobs without government action, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Airline stocks moved sharply higher on the news, which was first reported by Reuters. Shares of American Airlines were up 8.9per cent in afternoon trading while shares of United Airlines rose 6.3per cent. The letter, spearheaded by Senator Cory Gardner and addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and copied to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, was the first public disclosure of significant support in the Republican-led Senate for additional emergency funding for U.S. airlines. Senators Marco Rubio, Roger Wicker, James Inhofe, James Risch, John Cornyn, Todd Young, Susan Collins, Martha McSally and others who signed the letter said they backed a new six-month extension of the US$25 billion payroll support program ""to avoid furloughs and further support those workers."" After Reuters reported the letter, Cornyn's office released a copy of it and declined further comment. Airline officials and unions have been urging U.S. lawmakers to extend new assistance in the face of the coronavirus epidemic's devastating impact on airline travel. ""With air travel anticipated to remain low in the near future, Congress should also consider provisions to support and provide flexibility for businesses across the aviation industry similarly impacted, such as airport concessionaires and aviation manufacturing,"" the letter said. On July 27, a majority of the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives signed a letter also calling for a six-month extension for the payroll aid program that they argue is crucial to keeping hundreds of thousands of aviation workers employed through March 31. That letter was signed by 195 Democrats and 28 Republicans. Congress awarded US$25 billion in payroll assistance to U.S. passenger airlines in March, along with US$4 billion for cargo carriers and US$3 billion for airport contractors. Most of the bailout funds do not have to be paid back.
