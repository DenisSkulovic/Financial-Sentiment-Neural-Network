Bargain-hunting investors should stick to airlines with solid","   Over the past few weeks, COVID-19 has turned into a global pandemic, upending daily life worldwide. In the business world, no industry has been hit harder than aviation. With public health authorities vehemently urging people to avoid all non-essential travel, U.S. airlines have experienced a rapid decline in booking activity over the past few weeks, accompanied by a surge in cancellations. The threat to airlines is so grave that industry trade group Airlines for America recently requested over $50 billion in government aid for U.S. passenger airlines. On the other hand, most airline stocks have lost more than half of their value over the past month -- and some have experienced even deeper declines. Many investors may be wondering whether these share price declines make it a good time to buy airline stocks.  AIRLINE STOCK PERFORMANCE DATA BY YCHARTS. The answer is that it depends. Airlines with solid businesses and strong balance sheets are definitely worth a look. On the other hand, those with weaker cash flow and poor balance sheets are in grave danger. Let's see how American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) stack up. The collapse in air travel demand over the past few weeks has been truly unprecedented, forcing airline executives to rapidly adjust their plans. In a presentation on March 10, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker observed that load factors (the percentage of seats filled with paying customers) had declined in the first week of March, but that there were still plenty of people traveling. In response, he said that American planned to reduce domestic capacity by 7.5% in April and cut international flying by at least 10% through the summer. However, in a series of recent updates, American Airlines' management has acknowledged that conditions have deteriorated much further, requiring bolder action. On Thursday, American said it has cut its domestic schedule by 30% and its international flying by 75% in April, with deeper reductions likely in May. It will also temporarily park about 130 of its 150 widebody aircraft and 320 of its nearly 800 narrow-bodies. As aggressive as these actions are, they pale in comparison with what Delta recently announced. Back on March 10, at the same investor conference, Delta was planning a 15% capacity cut. Now it intends to slash flying by 70% until demand recovers, while parking at least half of its fleet.","Mar 21, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/21/coronavirus-decimating-industry-buy-airline-stocks.aspx
1,This Airline Stock Is a Buy After the Coronavirus Selloff | The Motley Fool,This Airline Stock Is a Buy After the Coronavirus Selloff. It hasn't fallen as much as many other airline stocks,"   Air travel is grinding to a halt in the U.S. and many other countries due to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. airlines have been sounding the alarm this month, warning investors and employees that revenue is plunging toward zero, which will lead to a period of deep losses and rapid cash burn. As a result, airline stocks have been crushed over the past month, with the Arca Airline Index plummeting 64% over that period. Low-fare airline giant Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has fared better than most of its peers, with shares falling 47% in the past month.  AIRLINE STOCK 1-MONTH PERFORMANCE DATA BY YCHARTS. However, while Southwest Airlines stock hasn't been marked down as much as most other airline stocks, it still looks like a great opportunity for investors to profit from the recent sell-off. Southwest's industry-leading balance sheet, low costs, and strong track record for generating free cash flow should enable it to survive the current crisis and potentially gain market share in the aftermath. Southwest Airlines has long stood out within the industry for having the strongest balance sheet of any major airline. As of the end of 2019, the company had $4.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, offset by $4 billion of debt and lease liabilities. As a result, it has solid investment-grade credit ratings from all three major ratings agencies. The COVID-19 pandemic will certainly put stress on Southwest's balance sheet, but the airline has the financial strength to weather the storm. During March, the company has drawn down the $1 billion available through its revolving credit facility and arranged an additional short-term $1 billion term loan. Thanks to this additional financing, Southwest Airlines had a massive cash stockpile of $6.2 billion as of earlier this week. Even $6.2 billion of cash may not be enough to see Southwest through this crisis, depending on how much pressure it faces on working capital, how long the pandemic lasts, and how quickly booking activity recovers once the rate of new cases slows down. Fortunately, Southwest Airlines also owns more than 500 unencumbered aircraft, worth approximately $10 billion. Some of those planes could be sold or used as collateral for additional borrowings if necessary, giving management plenty of levers to pay the bills. With new information arriving daily, it's impossible to know exactly how much money airlines will lose due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The letter says “If loans and or loan guarantees are enacted, equaling at least $29 billion, participating passenger and cargo air carriers commit to placing limits on executive compensation; eliminating stock buybacks over the life of the loans and eliminating stock dividends for the life of the loans.” The letter signed by CEOs from Alaska, Atlas, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, FedEx, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, United Airlines, and UPS was sent from the trade group Airlines for America. “The breadth and immediacy of the need to act cannot be overstated,” the CEOs warned. “It is urgent and unprecedented.” On Friday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian announced Delta (DAL) entered into a $2.6 billion secured credit facility, “enhancing the company’s liquidity as it manages through an unprecedented decline in air travel demand due to the COVID-19 outbreak.” Delta is already drawing $3 billion from its existing revolving credit facilities. Bastian told Delta’s 90,000 employees: “Maintaining ample liquidity during this crisis is critical to the essential service that Delta provides in America’s transportation infrastructure.” United (UAL) has also lined up multi-billion dollar lines of credit to get through the crisis and announced more capacity reductions as it scrambles to cut costs. In a historic move, “the airline is reducing its international schedule by 95% for April. The revised international schedule will be viewable on united.com on Sunday, March 22,” according to a press release. That includes a temporary suspension of all flights between the United States and Canada, starting April 1. Without billions of dollars from taxpayers, the airline CEOs threaten to layoff employees. “Unless worker payroll protection grants are passed immediately, many of us will be forced to take draconian measures such as furloughs,” they wrote in the letter to Congress.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Jonathan Ford Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story As the tide recedes on stock markets with the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, it has not taken long to reach the “Warren Buffett moment”. That is when we discover who in the ebbing market “is wearing shorts and who was swimming naked”, as the billionaire investor once said. Conspicuous among those lacking apparel in the present turmoil is the US airline industry. Having lavished a thumping 115 per cent of their free cash flow on share buybacks since 2014 (and that is aside from their regular dividends) America’s four biggest airlines have precious little to cover their pecuniary embarrassment. They lack the financial flexibility even to contribute materially towards the costly business interruptions that loom. Not being some optional extra but a crucial part of the US economy, that fragility has been dumped wholesale in the laps of the hard-pressed American public. Taxpayers are being asked for a $50bn bailout just to keep the airlines in the skies. Of course, airlines are not the only industry to have hollowed out their balance sheets with share buybacks, making themselves less resilient to downturns. In 2018, impelled by the boost to corporate profits delivered by President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, companies in the S&P 500 index repurchased $806bn worth of their own shares, beating the previous 2007 record by $200bn. Last year, they gobbled up $730bn. Nor have they confined themselves to surplus cash flow to do it. The proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds was as much as a third in 2016 and 2017, according to research by JPMorgan Chase. Now there is nothing wrong in principle with returning capital to investors. Companies in mature industries might lack sufficient appealing investment opportunities to absorb their surplus cash. But the buyback movement has been driven by less innocent motives. Leveraging simply to buy back shares is, as a recent article by three academics observed, “bad management, given that no revenue-generating investments are made that can allow the company to pay off the debt”. Airlines should be left to bear the financial hit for their inattention Its real appeal to bosses lies in the scope for financial engineering.

Seize a share opportunity today. Dividends," ‘The fact is that one of the earliest lessons I learned in business was that balance sheets and income statements are fiction, cash flow is reality,’ Chris Chocola once said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday advised all Australians against undertaking any non-essential domestic travel. Maybe more seriously, states like Victoria and New South Wales have been put into lockdown; in a move that will see only necessary services such as supermarkets, banks, pharmacies and convenience stores (amongst others) remain open. Unsurprisingly amidst these measures and their implied economic impact, markets plunged into further chaos at the open today: the ASX 200 fell as much as 8.28% – or 399 points in the first 30-minutes of trade, with the consumer discretionary and financial sectors being hit some of the hardest. In response to these radical but important moves from Australia’s government, a string of further Covid-19 related announcements have begun to filter out from some of the ASX’s top travel and airline companies. Go long or short on thousands of international stocks. Cash never stopped being king, some in the markets may have merely forgotten. In a move to bolster their balance sheet, Flight Centre (ASX: FLT) today announced that it would be cancelling its FY20 Interim Dividend; as well as implementing a 50% pay cut across the company’s senior leadership team. 'Cancelling the dividend was not a decision that was taken lightly, but we felt it was appropriate to preserve cash and protect long-term shareholder value, given the current uncertainty and the unprecedented actions that governments have been forced to adopt to slow the coronavirus's spread,' noted FLT’s MD Graham Turner. The company is set to make a further announcement regarding additional cost cutting and cash preservation plans soon. The company is currently suspended from official quotation. Webjet (ASX: WEB) today requested that its stock be suspended from quotation. Here, Webjet noted that it is currently finalising the details of a proposed raise, presumably as a means of shoring up its balance sheet. However, with details of the raise yet to be finalised, the company requested 'the voluntary suspension remain in place until Webjet releases an announcement in relation to the outcome of the proposed rasing.'

The fight over stock buybacks and corporate coronavirus bailouts, briefly explained. Share","Trump says he supports limits on stock buybacks for companies getting federal coronavirus help, which Democrats have advocated. Less than a week ago, the US airline industry requested $50 billion in grants and loans from the federal government to help it weather the collapse in travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and to help it provide some financial security for the industry’s 750,000 workers. While there is bipartisan support for the idea that airlines — or, at least, airline workers — should receive some kind of bailout from the federal government, both Democratic lawmakers and unions representing airline workers have warned that this bailout must come with strings attached. Any airline industry bailout, according to Association of Flight Attendants President Sara Nelson, “should come with significant conditions to help workers and keep planes flying, not enrich shareholders or pad executive bonuses.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), meanwhile, proposed eight ambitious restrictions to be placed on any company receiving a bailout, including a permanent ban on companies engaging in stock buybacks — that is, a rule so that a company may not spend its excess profits to buy stock from its existing investors. Buybacks can provide a windfall to corporate executives and other investors because they tend to inflate the price of a stock by reducing the number of shares of that stock in circulation. However, they offer little benefit to workers or consumers. While it still appears unlikely that a permanent ban on buybacks will be included in any corporate bailouts, two recent developments suggest that temporary buyback restrictions will be imposed on companies that receive federal bailouts. On Saturday, the CEOs of 10 US airlines and the head of Airlines for America, the industry’s trade group, signed a letter to congressional leaders. In it, they agreed to “eliminating stock buy backs over the life of the loans” and “eliminating stock dividends for the life of the loans” if the industry receives at least $29 billion in loans or loan guarantees. The industry leaders also agreed to “limits on executive compensation.” President Donald Trump also announced his support for restrictions on buybacks in a press conference Saturday afternoon. “I want money to be used for workers and keeping businesses open, not buybacks,” the president said, adding that he is “strongly recommending a buyback exclusion.” Though negotiations about Congress’s “phase 3” response to the economic fallout from coronavirus remain ongoing, these developments","Mar 21, 2020",https://www.vox.com/2020/3/21/21189471/stock-buybacks-coronavirus-bailouts-airlines-trump

News Tips. CNBC","The S&P 500 could return to record highs by early next year if U.S. efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak work and the government can quickly move forward with fiscal stimulus to cushion the impending economic blow, JPMorgan’s chief U.S. equity strategist said Friday. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note to clients he expects the S&P 500 to reach 3,400 in early 2021. That would top an all-time high of 3,386 set on Feb. 19. It is also 47% higher than the broad market average’s Friday close of 2,304.92. The S&P 500 entered a bear market on March 12 — bringing the longest-ever bull expansion to an abrupt end — as the fast spread of the coronavirus and resulting shutdowns soured economic and profit growth forecasts around the world. However, after the relentless selling wave, Lakos-Bujas now sees a chance for stocks to return to record levels. “Acknowledging that equity markets globally are now down 30-50% from their recent highs, and that investor positioning has become increasingly favorable, we see an asymmetrical return profile for equities with upside significantly higher than downside over the next year,” Lakos-Bujas wrote. For his scenario to play out, though, the U.S. government must pass a “comprehensive fiscal package promptly.” The White House is currently seeking more than $1 trillion in government stimulus to soften the virus’ economic hit. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the administration wants to send direct payments to U.S. kids and adults as part of that package. Those payments would total about $500 billion. Several industry groups — particularly airlines — are also seeking relief money. “Aggressive fiscal policy needs to be undertaken immediately,” Lakos-Bujas said, noting that failure to pass such measures “would likely result in a broader capitulation of equities including the heavyweight momentum stocks.” The other side of the equation is curbing the coronavirus spread in the U.S. More than 15,000 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. along with over 200 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Authorities in the U.S. have imposed measures to contain the number of cases and “flatten the curve,” which would keep the country’s health care system from being overrun by the outbreak. “The spread of the outbreak in the US will still remain a key concern,” the strategist said. “At the same time, there are early signs of progress being made of potential anti-viral treatment, though the outcome","Mar 21, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/21/stocks-can-return-to-records-early-next-year-if-the-us-can-curb-coronavirus-spread-says-jpmorgan.html

As Hawaii’s hotel and restaurant sector reels from Gov. David Ige’s announcement of a 14-day quarantine for tourists visiting the islands, Hawaiian Airlines, the state’s largest and perhaps most important single travel-related company, also faces enormous uncertainty. Like the rest of the tourism industry, the airlines have been battered. Passenger traffic into Honolulu has already dropped dramatically, according to data from the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism. On Sunday, the airline announced it would take the dramatic step of suspending almost all of its long-haul flights starting late next week. The move comes a day after Gov. David Age announced a plan to quarantine all visitors to Hawaii for two weeks starting Thursday. Peter Ingram, Hawaiian’s chief executive, said the airline will continue to operate its regular flight schedule through Wednesday to allow people to get home and for airplanes to be able to return to their home bases. The company said it will continue to provide one daily nonstop flight between Honolulu and Los Angeles and its Thursday flight between Honolulu and American Samoa in order to provide a baseline of service out o the islands. ” We will be ready to resume our schedule when the quarantine has been lifted,” Ingram said in a news release. At a news conference with Ige and other officials at the State Capitol on Saturday Ingram gave no hint of the dramatic step; however, he predicted the governor’s move would all but shut the flow of visitors to the islands. “I don’t think there’s much appetite for 14 days in a hotel,” Ingram said Saturday, adding that people come to Hawaii to spend time outdoors.

18,This Is the Only Airline Stock I'd Own Right Now - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . This Is the Only Airline Stock I’d Own Right Now. CAE Inc..,"      Chris MacDonald | March 22, 2020 | More on: CAE The only airline stock I’d own right now isn’t an airline. CAE Inc. (TSX:CAE) is a Canadian company specializing in flight simulators designed to train new pilots and retrain existing pilots. CAE is company which has very clearly benefited from the unfortunate events surrounding Boeing Co.‘s 737 Max plans in 2019. CAE’s profit has topped estimates recently, leading to a stock outperformance recently. This outperformance CAE is even more impressive when one compares the company’s share price with that of nearly any airline since the beginning of 2020. Of course, the airline sector has been hit particularly hard of late due to the coronavirus outbreak. I anticipate more near-term pain may be on the horizon for investors as we find out more about how extensively the industry has been affected by coronavirus-related travel curtailments. Companies like CAE are great ways for airline/travel bulls to bet on this sector right now, partly because CAE is relatively immune to exogenous shocks like coronavirus. The company’s massive order backlog of more than $9 billion provides investors with long-term cash flow certainty. It also supports the company’s current valuation on its own. Furthermore, long-term demographic trends remain favourable to CAE investors. Higher numbers of pilots are retiring each and every year, which helps CAE grow its order backlog further.
