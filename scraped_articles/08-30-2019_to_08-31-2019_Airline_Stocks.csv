0,Airline Stocks Set to Rise this Fall,Airline Stocks Set to Rise this Fall. Labor Day holiday traffic projected to increase 4% vs. last year. American Airlines,"Airline stocks have faced stiff headwinds over the past month as concerns over an airfare price war in 2020 gather momentum due to capacity growth from the re-entry of the embattled Boeing 737 MAX. Analysts, suppliers, and airlines expect the plane to be flying again sometime during the fourth quarter, although The Boeing Company (BA) has not disclosed a specific date. ""We believe 2020 capacity from the publicly traded U.S. airlines will increase 5.6% versus 3.0% in 2019,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker wrote in a research note cited by Barron's. Despite the prospect of a capacity-driven price war, the sector remains supported by upbeat consumer confidence, consistent wage growth, and household net worth near all-time highs. Airlines for America (A4A), the trade organization for leading U.S. airlines, projects a 4% increase in Labor Day holiday traffic compared to last year. From a technical standpoint, the major carriers sit near crucial support levels, indicating that the market has fully factored in growing supply. Those who see airline stocks flying to greater heights in the fourth quarter should consider American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL), along with the sector's proxy exchange-traded fund (ETF), the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS). Let's take a closer look at each and explore several trades that may be ready for takeoff. American Airlines operates as a network air carrier with almost 7,000 scheduled daily flights to more than 350 destinations in 50 countries. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company operates a mainline fleet of 956 aircraft, including 24 of the troubled 737 MAX jets that have resulted in the cancellation of multiple flights per day. The U.S. Department of Transportation recently approved American's joint venture with Australia's leading carrier Qantas Airways, helping the airline expand its reach in the Oceania region. American trades at about five times 2020 earnings, below the industry average multiple of 9 times. The stock has a market capitalization of $11.72 billion, issues a 1.58% dividend yield, and is trading down 18.60% over the past month as of Aug. 30, 2019. American Airlines shares have oscillated within a broad descending channel since October of last year. Price broke below the pattern's lower trendline earlier this week but quickly reversed, indicating a possible head-fake move. Furthermore, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator line crossed above its signal line in Thursday's trading session to generate a buy signal.

Employees See full profile American Airlines' stock price has steadily decreased the past couple of years, and that trend accelerated in August. American Airlines Group Inc. (Nasdaq: AAL) shares lost 30 percent of their value in the last 30 days. Based on historical precedent, some analysts see this as an opportunity to find value. Jamie Baker, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), said current-day American is similar to pre-merger Continental Airlines and post-merger United Airlines, who saw their stock price rebound after similarly dramatic declines with reliable consistency. Continental and United merged in 2010. ""The market has consistently been proven mistaken when delivering this level of shellacking,"" Baker wrote about similar instances at Continental/United in a note to clients. ""Those brave enough to step in have consistently been rewarded."" American shares are down 50 percent since the beginning of 2018, which is the worst performance among the Big 4 airlines. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) shares are down 21 percent in the same timeframe, while Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) is up 2 percent, and United Airlines Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: UAL) increased 21 percent.    But other carriers, Southwest and United, also have Max planes in their fleets. Delta has remained unscathed through the ordeal because it doesn't operate the Max. American has also been dealing with fallout from a dispute with its mechanics. The airline sued the mechanics unions in May, saying they engaged in a work slowdown which resulted in a bump in cancellations. American said on Aug. 13 the slowdown caused 950 cancellations since June 14. American won a battle in court against the unions which represent its mechanics, and is asking for sanctions against the unions for financial damages incurred during the slowdown. Baker set a December price target of $40 for American. Shares were trading at $26.50 in midday trading on Friday.

3,"10 Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy -- TLRY, AEO, SMG, JBLU | InvestorPlace",10 Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy. These 10 stocks to buy are right in the sweet spot. Tilray (TLRY). CyberArk Software," Source: Shutterstock For some investors, mid-cap stocks are a perfect hunting ground for stocks to buy. Small-cap stocks offer more volatility — and generally have underperformed in this bull market. Large-cap stocks often have so much coverage that finding a real buying opportunity is difficult. So mid-cap stocks — defined here as those with a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion — offer a nice balance. The companies are large enough to own significant market share, and provide steady performance. They can be small enough to, on occasion, dip below the market’s radar. Among the 1,000-plus mid-cap stocks on U.S. markets, these 10 look like potentially the best stocks to buy. They span different industries — and have very different risk/reward profiles. But all 10, at the least, have a strong bull case. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  To be clear, marijuana producer Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) is not for the faint of heart. It may not even be a buy just yet, as the chart of TLRY stock is a classic falling knife. This, after all, is a stock that looked like a bubble less than a year ago. TLRY stock went from $20 to $300 in a matter of weeks. Since then, shares have done nothing but fall. That crazy trading likely colors Tilray stock in the mind of some investors. And with cannabis sentiment clearly negative, particularly among the larger names, it continues to be the victim of a steady sell-off. A Q2 report this month that investors took as disappointing certainly didn’t help. But as I wrote after earnings, there’s actually an interesting strategic play here. Tilray is staying patient, focusing on cannabis derivatives instead of producing flower whose price it believes will eventually crater. Given plunging prices in legalized U.S. markets like Oregon and Colorado, that strategy makes some sense. Again, the chart here is ugly, and patience might be advised. Investors skeptical of cannabis growth should look elsewhere. But even investors intrigued by the space seem to see Tilray as some sort of fly-by-night pump stock after last year’s bubble. It’s not. And at some point, TLRY stock will bottom — and could see a nice rebound. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE There aren’t a lot of growth stocks to buy in the mid-cap stocks space at the moment.

5,Where Will Southwest Airlines Be in 10 Years? | The Motley Fool,Where Will Southwest Airlines Be in 10 Years?. The largest domestic airline has international expansion on its itinerary.. First stop,"   Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has been a rewarding investment for investors. A $1,000 investment made in 1990 with dividends reinvested would be worth $54,000. Those gains were driven by Southwest's strategy of keeping operating costs as low as possible, pass the savings on to the customer with low fares, and offer a little in-flight hospitality.  Even with competitors starting to come on strong in recent years, Southwest delivered a record year in 2018. Revenue hit an all-time high of $22 billion, and annual profit also set a record at $2.4 billion.  So far, 2019 has had its ups and downs. The highlight has been the launch of the new service to Hawaii, with the low point being the delays in getting the new Boeing 737 MAX 8 in the air.  Beyond the short term, there is much opportunity for Southwest to remain a good growth stock. Here's a look of what's on the company's growth agenda and how it can stay ahead of the competition. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. Southwest spent the past few decades expanding its coverage from a regional focus to nationwide. It's now the largest domestic airline, connecting 101 cities across 40 states.  To keep growing, Southwest has started to expand its routing outside the continental U.S., which comprised 95% of available seat miles (ASM) in 2018. Currently, flights to Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America represent 5% of total ASM. Over the next 10 years, look for Southwest to expand its routing well beyond the continental U.S. Flights to Hawaii just kicked off earlier this year, with flights from Oakland and San Jose going to Honolulu, Kona, and Kahului. The $99 fare for flights between Sacramento and Hawaii starting in January 2020 have already sold out, so this should be a popular service. Southwest plans to expand the service with additional connections between California and Hawaii next year.  Hawaii will be the primary focus of management's expansion strategy through 2020, but the company has huge ambitions to expand internationally.  Southwest has been the most profitable airline over the last half-century. It's the only major airline that hasn't filed for bankruptcy. Southwest achieved this remarkable feat in a cutthroat industry by doing things differently than its peers. The company sticks to short routes and flies one type of aircraft (the Boeing 737). Also, while its competitors employ what's known","Aug 31, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/31/where-will-southwest-airlines-be-in-10-years.aspx
6,What Is a Cyclical Stock? Definition and Examples - TheStreet,. . What Is a Cyclical Stock? Definition and Examples. What Is a Cyclical Stock?. Cyclical Stocks vs. Non-Cyclical Stocks:,"Shutterstock   Cyclical stocks tend to rise and fall based upon changes in the economic cycle. Often the reaction to changes in certain economic factors is quite predictable and savvy investors will buy or sell cyclical stocks based on their estimate of changes in these economic factors.  Airline stocks are a good example of a group whose stocks would be considered to be cyclical. When the economy is doing well and there is low unemployment, travel will likely be up. Businesses can afford for their employees to travel on business. Personal travel will likely be up as well, since consumers will have the money to spend on travel.   Expenditures on these and other types of goods and services that are ""nice to haves"" vs. day-to-day necessities are considered to be discretionary.  The stocks of these cyclical companies can be high-flyers when the economy is doing well, unemployment is low, and businesses are generally profitable.  However, when economic conditions change, these types of stocks can fall hard. Especially those companies offering luxury products or services. For example, people may still need to travel for business or personal reasons, but if money is a bit tight, they may opt for more basic accommodations vs. staying in a luxury resort.  In the same vein, people will need to replace their cars, but instead of buying a high-end luxury SUV with all of the bells and whistles, they may opt for a used, more basic mini van to cart around their family, in down economy.  The performance of cyclical stocks will tend to follow the ups and downs of the general economy far more than that of non-cyclicals. Their price and performance can be quite volatile.  Investing in cyclical stocks needs to be done with care. A portfolio loaded with cyclicals can do quite well when the economy is booming but can take a severe hit when things head south. As we've discussed, many of the products and services offered by the companies behind these stocks can be forgone by consumers who are concerned about their finances or who may even be suffering a job loss in the down economy.  This isn't to say that investing in cyclical stocks should be avoided, quite the contrary. But as with any type of investment, it's important to understand the dynamics of the company and its stock","Aug 31, 2019",https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/what-is-a-cyclical-stock-15072218

As pandemic deepens, Texas’ unemployment rate rises to 8.1% in November,","  BUSINESSAIRLINES By Kyle Arnold 6:00 AM on Aug 30, 2019 CDT — Updated at 3:44 PM on Aug 30, 2019 CDT American Airlines' stock price hit a five-year low this week — making a share less valuable than it was the day the Fort Worth-based company merged with US Airways in 2013. Beleaguered by the grounding of 24 of its Boeing 737 Max aircraft and labor disputes with maintenance workers, shares of American Airlines' stock closed at $24.35 in trading Tuesday. That's a few cents less than it was valued on Dec. 9, 2013, the day it officially absorbed US Airways.   It's since rebounded slightly, but is still trading at levels not seen since 2013. It closed Friday at $26.31. ""If you were a shareholder at American, wouldn't you be impatient and unhappy?"" said Helane Becker, airlines analyst at financial services firm Cowen Inc. ""I think American needs to address its issues in a timely fashion."" The recent slide has been so bad that more than $4 billion worth of market value has been wiped out in the past five weeks, said JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker. Researchers have proven that being helpful to others releases dopamine — the “feel-good” chemical — in our brains and lights up the same... It's been a rough few years for American Airlines on Wall Street, following its disappointing on-time performance in 2018 compounded by more struggles this year. Investors have responded by fleeing from the stock and running to competitors. In January 2018, the company's stock price hit a post-merger high of $59 a share. American has lost two-thirds of its value since then. The market cap peaked at $38.6 billion in January. That sunk to a low of $10.9 billion this week, the lowest since American was in bankruptcy. Becker said the past few years should have been golden times for American Airlines, which recorded revenue of $44.5 billion last year and a profit of $1.4 billion. Demand for airline tickets is strong and fares are increasing. But in the minds of investors, American has fallen behind its peers, even those that have faced similar struggles. In the past five years, American shares have fallen in value 33%, while Southwest Airlines shares are up 56% and United Airlines shares are up 63%. The Dow 30 group of stocks is up more than 50% over that period.

8,"Woodford buys BAT, BT and IAG in FTSE 100 spending spree - Citywire",". Woodford buys BAT, BT and IAG in FTSE 100 spending spree. Leave a comment!","  Neil Woodford has spent £145 million on shares in British American Tobacco (BATS), BT (BT) and British Airways owner International Airlines Group (ICAG) as the embattled fund manager seeks to reposition his flagship Woodford Equity Income fund and secure the lifting of its suspension. Woodford has pledged to reposition the fund as a 'much more liquid portfolio' before a targeted reopening in early December, by selling down hard-to-trade smaller companies and unquoted stocks.  The fund manager has raised around £900 million in share sales since the suspension across his three funds, with the bulk of that coming from Woodford Equity Income, and has invested around 80% of the proceeds in his flagship fund into FTSE 100 stocks. The new purchases are disclosed in Woodford Equity Income's interim report, covering the six months to the end of June and showing the manager's activity in the first few weeks since dealing in the fund was suspended. They mark a significant departure for Woodford, who at the time of his last full portfolio disclosure for the fund at the end of April held only three FTSE 100 stocks: house builders Barratt Developments (BDEV) and Taylor Wimpey (TW) and tobacco company Imperial Brands (IMB). His fund had instead featured heavy holdings in hard-to-trade stocks listed on the junior Alternative Investment Market and unquoted companies. This contributed to the manager's difficulty in funding withdrawals as investors fled amid poor performance and culminated in the fund's suspension in June.  A Woodford spokesman said: 'Neil continues to reposition the portfolio into more liquid FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies, but still reflecting the same investment strategy. 'This strategy is founded on a belief that the global economic environment is not as robust as equity markets are implying.' Woodford's £39 million acquisition of shares in British American Tobacco, a 1.1% position in the fund, rekindles the manager's relationship with a stock he has held throughout the bulk of his 30-year career as a fund manager. The stock was a perennial feature of the Invesco Income and High Income fund he ran and was the third largest holding when he launched Woodford Equity Income five years ago.  Woodford sold the shares from his flagship fund in 2017, returning only for a brief foray last year. But it remained one of the largest holdings in the funds he ran for financial advice group St James's","Aug 31, 2019",https://citywire.co.uk/investment-trust-insider/news/woodford-buys-bat-bt-and-iag-in-ftse-100-spending-spree/a1263441
