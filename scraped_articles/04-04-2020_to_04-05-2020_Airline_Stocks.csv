0,Why I’m Not Surprised Warren Buffett Is Selling His Airline Stocks | The Motley Fool,Why I’m Not Surprised Warren Buffett Is Selling His Airline Stocks. Berkshire just disclosed it had sold Delta and Southwest,"   After market close on Friday, April 3, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) filed two disclosure forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saying the company had sold off 2.3 million shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) for $74 million and nearly 13 million shares of Delta (NYSE:DAL) for $314 million. Buffett and Co. had to disclose these sales because Berkshire had owned over 10% of each company. Normally, public equity trades don't have to be disclosed until a company files its 13-F statements in the middle of the next quarter. It's unclear if Berkshire has also sold its smaller stakes in United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) or American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Some may have been surprised that Buffett, who is famous for coining the phrase, ""Be greedy when others are fearful,"" would begin selling off stocks that are now trading at low-single-digit P/E ratios and are off by much more than 50% since the year began. However, these sales don't surprise me at all. In fact, I wouldn't be shocked to learn Berkshire has already sold off its United and American stakes before making the above trades and thus the mandatory disclosures, which is sure to make airline stocks fall further on Monday. Here's why. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. While many know the Buffett-ism, ""be greedy when others are fearful,"" and ""our favorite holding period is forever,"" investors should know that those aren't blanket statements by any means. For the second statement, the real quote is, ""when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.""  While all airlines still have their same managements, it's quite possible Buffett has changed his mind when it comes to airlines being outstanding businesses. If Buffett now believes COVID-19 has changed the intrinsic value of America's airlines, it shows a lot of objectivity and internal fortitude to sell and cut losses. In that sense, these other, lesser-known Buffett-isms would apply to the current situation: While Buffett usually holds firm to his long-term-oriented, buy-and-hold value investing approach, he has also shown no hesitation to sell when his mind changes about a company's long-term prospects. Buffett completely sold out of IBM (NYSE:IBM) in 2018 after holding the stock for seven years, and has also been selling off longtime holding Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) after a series of scandals since 2016 sullied the bank's brand and reputation.

1,Did Warren Buffett Really Sell These 2 Airline Stocks? | The Motley Fool,Did Warren Buffett Really Sell These 2 Airline Stocks?. The move seems to run counter to everything the Berkshire Hathaway,"   The coronavirus pandemic has turned the global economy upside down, and stock markets have felt the effects around the world. Even legendary investor Warren Buffett hasn't been immune, as shares of the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) conglomerate that he leads have fallen, along with the value of the stocks that Berkshire holds in its portfolio. Most investors have expected that Buffett would be a big buyer of stocks during the market downturn, even perhaps adding to his holdings of hard-hit airlines. Yet on Friday, investors got their first inkling of what Berkshire Hathaway has been doing with its stock portfolio, and to many people's surprise, it involved the insurance giant selling stocks rather than buying them. Below, we'll look at the two airline stocks that Berkshire chose to sell -- and what it likely says about Buffett's view on airlines generally. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Berkshire Hathaway filed two disclosure forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 3, after the market closed. The need to file the disclosures was somewhat of a shock, as Berkshire has 45 days to disclose its end-of-quarter holdings as of March 31. However, rules are different from companies in which an owner has a 10% or greater stake, prompting the need for the filings. The forms included two sets of sales: The two stocks took massive hits in after-hours trading Friday after the disclosures. Delta stock was down 11%, while Southwest took a 5% hit. Investors clearly saw the moves as a vote of no confidence from Buffett about the two airline holdings. Berkshire has a more complex management structure than it used to, with other portfolio managers having some responsibility for the insurance giant's holdings. However, Buffett has said that he manages three of the company's four airline stock holdings, so at least one of the sales would have come under his purview. Interestingly, the two transactions look fundamentally different from each other. The Southwest sale was relatively small, reducing Berkshire's holdings of the airline by just 4% and leaving a stake worth more than $1.5 billion. The remaining stake is just slightly below 10% of the outstanding shares, making it seem as though the reason for the sale was to get under that key 10% reporting threshold. The Delta sale, though, is potentially more meaningful. If moving below the 10% ownership threshold were the motivation there, then","Apr 4, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/04/did-warren-buffett-really-sell-these-2-airline-sto.aspx

Compete Risk,"Berkshire Hathaway sold shares of Delta and Southwest last week Airline stocks are among worst performers amid pandemic Buffett recently said he wouldn't sell off his stakes in airlines Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stakes in two airlines as the industry faces an unprecedented decline in travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to SEC filings1﻿ , Berkshire Hathaway sold nearly 13 million shares of Delta Airlines (DAL) last Wednesday for around $314 million, and 2.3 million shares of Southwest(LUV) for around $74 million on Thursday. The sales were disclosed after U.S. airlines applied for payroll grants from the U.S. government as part of the Cares Act to keep employees on the payroll amid the crisis. Delta and other airlines have warned that they will have to do massive layoffs without government assistance as air travel has dwindled due to travel bans. Last week, major carriers reported they were only at 5-15% passenger capacity as most cities are on lockdown and all but essential travel has been forbidden. The sales of these airline stocks by Berkshire Hathaway comes just a few weeks after Warren Buffett told Yahoo Finance2﻿ that he wouldn't be selling his company's stakes in Southwest and Delta. Berkshire Hathaway still owns 59 million shares of Delta and 51.3 million shares of Southwest Airlines following the sales, according to filings. Delta, which reports earnings this Thursday, has already projected that its second quarter revenue would fall 90%. Southwest will report earnings on April 23.

3,Forget Air Canada: 2 Other Airline Stocks Could Make You Rich! - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Forget Air Canada: 2 Other Airline Stocks Could Make You Rich!. Chorus.,"      Vishesh Raisinghani | April 4, 2020 | More on: CHR ONEX Air Canada seems to have caught the attention of investors. The stock has lost 68% of its value since January and could lose more as global and regional air travel remains frozen. This week, the airline announced it would lay off 16,500 workers. Managers would take a pay cut ranging from 25% to 100% of their 2020 salaries.  This isn’t the first time Canada’s largest airline has suffered drastic losses. During the 2008 financial crisis, the stock lost 75% of its value. Investors who bought in 2009 received a 5,959% return by early 2020. So, history could repeat itself this time.  However, I believe there are two other airline stocks that serve as better bets on a rebound in global air traffic.  Chorus Aviation (TSX:CHR.B) is lesser known and comparatively riskier than Air Canada. The tiny company provides aircraft leasing and maintenance services to large regional carriers. Basically, it rents airplanes.  The company reportedly had $128 million in cash on its books as of March, 18, but suffers from a hefty debt burden. Long-term debt was nearly 3.9 times the value of equity. Meanwhile, the dividend payout ratio was 57.4% before this crisis began, so a dividend cut could be on the cards.  However, I have three reasons to be bullish on Chorus. The company has a long-term contract with Air Canada that should ensure revenue regardless of disruption. If airlines stop paying leases, the company can repossess the aircraft that will retain their value. Finally, I expect domestic air travel to recover sooner than international air travel as Canada tames the virus in April/May.  Although Chorus is undoubtedly a risky bet, it could have huge rewards if domestic air travel recovers by summer. If Canada tames the outbreak soon, regional air traffic could rebound sharply.   Canada’s second-largest airline, Westjet, is no longer a publicly traded company. However, its owner Onex Corporation (TSX:ONEX) could serve as a proxy.  Private equity giant Onex is exposed to the airline industry through two subsidiaries: Westjet and Sky Chef. This means an eventual rebound in global air traffic will have a tremendous impact on Onex’s balance sheet. Meanwhile, the company has enough cash on hand to weather this storm and ongoing economic shutdown.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   Billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold about 18% of its stake in Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) for $314 million as the U.S. airline operator said it expects revenues to plunge 90% in the second quarter. Berkshire sold about 13 million Delta shares on Wednesday and Thursday priced between $22.96 and $26.04, according to SEC filings. Separately, Buffet’s Berkshire also divested about 4% of its stake in Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) dumping about 2.3 million shares for about $74 million, SEC filings show. Delta shares, which were trading around $59 at the start of the year, slid 0.1% to $22.48 on Friday. The sales come as Delta CEO Ed Bastian warned that the embattled airline expects second-quarter revenue to drop 90%. “Delta is burning more than $60 million in cash every day, we know we still haven’t seen the bottom,” Bastian wrote in a memo to employees. “Without the self-help actions we are taking to save costs and raise new financing, that money would be gone by June.” At the end of last month, five-star analyst Michael Linenberg at Deutsche Bank raised Delta’s rating to Buy from Hold. Overall Wall Street analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating for Delta, which is split into 7 Buys and 5 Holds. The $51 analyst average price target implies a staggering 127% yield should the airline industry recover and the target be met in the coming 12 months. (Delta’s stock analysis on TipRanks) Bastian added that the airline continues to shrink its network as demand falls and will operate just enough flying to maintain essential services. In April, the airline’s schedule will be at least 80% smaller than originally planned, with 115,000 flights cancelled. Buffet’s Berkshire is also a big investor in two other U.S. carriers American Airlines Group Inc (AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL). Related News:

6,Why did Warren Buffett sell his Delta and Southwest Airline stocks? - Quora,,"If I could answer your question accurately, I would be, an Oracle and not Warren Buffet. I can only venture a guess. The airline industry is extremely competitive and known historically as not yielding huge profits because of the overhead. I think even, The Guru of Investing has to admit sometimes that he made a bad business investment. I have no idea why he would add airline stocks to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio in the first place . Delta pays a 5.64% dividend which is not bad. Southwest pays a 2.02% dividend. He could do much better buying equities in other business sectors. The only th  As was said by someone else. Before COVID19, Buffett stated that Berkshire accidentally held more than 10% of Delta’s shares, see this
. This occurred when Delta bought back shares, which decreased the supply of shares and increased the percentage of shares held by remaining investors. This changed the rules for Berkshire - holding over 10% of a companies shares requires you to report subsequent buys and sells and justification. This is how we know he sold some recently. Just a guess but they act under “never waste a good disaster.” I bought Boeing at $32 after 911. I also bought Delta at $2.5 but it filed reorganization. Warren did say he wouldn't get in a bidding war over Boeing. My wife took a 25% position in it at $106. Should have put a 10% trailing stop loss on it as it hit $190 in 3 days. But she is a long time purchaser which works out well for me after 37 years. He rarely sells and his preferred holding period is forever. These companies are not going out of business and will fully recover at some point after this virus is gone. I think it would be more likely he would purchase Southwest in its entirety if they are interested in selling. When his purchased and sales are made public you are going to see mostly purchases. Berkshire Hathaway shares being one of his largest. He isn’t going to sell underwater stocks simply because of a temporary event taking the share price lower. These are the times he is at his best. 1.3 billion in cash to put to work. The airline industry is heading for turbulence. Anyone can see that.

9,Why did Berkshire Hathaway sell Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines stock? DAL LUV — Canadian Value Investors,Canadian Value Investors. . Why did Berkshire Hathaway sell Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines stock? DAL LUV. Berkshire’s Airline,"  There was a lot of press on late Friday, April 3rd, about Berkshire Hathaway reducing their stakes in Delta and Southwest Airlines. At the time of this writing, Delta was trading (in after-hours) down 11% and Southwest down 5% following this news. Is Berkshire throwing in the towel due to COIVD-19 or is there something else going on?  We think that, as usual, the headline does not tell the full story.  For those just joining us – we wrote a piece on Warren Buffett’s purchases of the big four airlines. After having a very negative view on the industry for decades Buffett turned around and bought roughly 10% of Delta, Southwest, United, and American. We cover the Why of the thesis here - http://www.canadianvalueinvestors.com/home/2018/6/4/investing-in-north-american-airlines-why-did-berkshire-hathaway-buy-airlines-anyway  We also just wrote about Air Canada and its fight against COVID-19 - Will it Survive? http://www.canadianvalueinvestors.com/home/2020/3/24/will-air-canada-survive-covid-19   Now, Berkshire owns approximately 10% of each of the big four. However, the interesting thing is that Berkshire only owned more than 10% in two of the four, Southwest and Delta, and under SEC rules if you own more than 10%, even a smidgen, you are considered an insider. It should be noted that Buffett accidentally ended up owning more than 10% of Delta after they made significant share buybacks (where he affectionately referred to this event as like losing his virginity). After the disclosed sales they now own 9.2% of Delta and 9.9% of Southwest.  Is Berkshire selling these stakes now to get below the 10% ownership level (and thereby no longer be considered an “insider/affiliate”), or is this the beginning of them selling down their positions more materially along United and American?  We find it also helps to look at the actual filings and reports that the media refers to. In this case, you can see the day trading fun by day that Berkshire had last week.  Basically, once you own more than 10% of a company, the SEC classifies you as an “insider,” not too different from being an officer of the company. There are a couple considerations: Short-swing profits: Within a 6-month period, if you buy and sell shares at a profit, OR if you sell and buy shares at a lower price, you must repay that profit or avoided loss.  Acquisitions/Other Material Transactions: If you acquire a company after reaching this threshold, you","Apr 4, 2020",http://www.canadianvalueinvestors.com/home/2020/4/4/why-did-berkshire-hathaway-sell-delta-air-lines-and-southwest-airlines-stock-dal-luv

The guru reduced,"Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) is known for making bold bets and going against the grain by investing in unloved companies when everything seems to be going against them. Therefore, it didn’t come as a surprise when Buffett decided to bet on Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in the first week of March when the market was punishing the stock due to coronavirus fears.  Just one month after increasing its stake in Delta, however, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) decided to unload some of its shares in a surprise move. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 3, the conglomerate disclosed the sale.  Source: Form 4 Berkshire netted approximately $314 million from the transaction. With the salce completed last week, the conglomerate's stake in Delta has decreased from 71.9 million shares to 58.9 million.  It still owns about 9% of the total outstanding shares of the airline. On March 13, Buffett told Yahoo Finance that he would not be selling airline stocks anytime soon even though signs of trouble were ahead. The sale is a complete contrast to this statement. The subject of this analysis is to determine whether investors should be alarmed by this sudden shift in the guru’s stance. Tough times ahead There was never a doubt about the Covid-19 virus negatively impacting travel and leisure sector companies. However, things have escalated at an unprecedented speed and, according to a recent Bloomberg report, nearly two-thirds of the global population is currently staying indoors to curb the spread of the virus. Amid this chaos, Delta Air Lines has received a beating in the market.  What is more alarming is that the company will most likely report a significant decline in revenue and earnings in the coming quarters. In a memo sent to employees on April 3, CEO Ed Bastian wrote: “This week we closed the books on the first quarter of 2020, and it was unlike any quarter in Delta’s history. We know that the second quarter will be even more difficult than the first as the pandemic continues to evolve.” He went on to reveal eye-popping numbers regarding the current state of business operations.

BRYAN BORZYKOWSKI
 ON APRIL 5, 2020 For those who are considering whether to take any additional cash they have and put it into the market, perhaps the more important question right now not when to buy in, but how?  Photo by Allie Smith on Unsplash COVID-19 continued its disruption of the stock market, with equities bouncing around once again as March drew to a close and April kicked off. The S&P 500 finished down by about 3.5%, while the S&P/TSX Composite Index rose by about 1.5%. Overall, the two markets are down by 25% and 27%, respectively, since February 21, when stocks began their freefall.  ADVERTISEMENT  A lot of people are now considering whether or not to take any additional cash they have and put it into the market. Many of the fund managers I’ve spoken over the last couple of weeks are investing a bit here and there, but they are also being cautious as another decline could come, especially if the quarantine lasts longer than expected, if a vaccine doesn’t come in 12 to 18 months as expected or if more people die or get sick than predicted.  For those who want to buy some stock, dollar-cost averaging is a good approach. If you have, say, $12,000 earmarked for investing, put $1,000 into the market every month. If stocks fall again, then at least you’ve only lost a bit of that investment and then you get to buy again when stocks are lower. It will likely take a while for the market to rebound completely, so if it does rise, you can make money on the way up. Perhaps the more important question right now is how should you buy in? What sectors might rebound faster than others? What sort of company fundamentals should you be paying attention to in a time like this?  Compare the Best Online Brokers in Canada There’s an idea in investing that what goes down must come up. That’s especially applicable with certain asset class types, such as equities, bonds and gold. When an asset class has a bad year, it seems to rebound the next. For instance, in 2008, the S&P 500 fell by 36.9%; in 2009 it was up 25.9%.

17,5 Best Stocks To Buy In April 2020 - Stock Navigators,5 Best Stocks To Buy In April 2020. . AIRLINES. Delta (DAL):. United (UAL):. . CRUISES. Royal Caribbean (RCL):. .,"  This is Tim Luong with Stock Navigators reaching out with the five best stocks to buy in April 2020!  I’m currently thinking about what industries have been affected the most by the complications of coronavirus. I believe that this is the beginning of the next recession. I’m looking to average in stocks over the next 6 to 18 months. Rather than trying to predict the bottom, I’m going to be looking to average in. “Average in” means that basically just means putting in a set amount each time, consistently over the next 6 to 18 months so that my average price will be very reasonable. What markets have been most affected?  It’s airlines, it’s cruises and hotels. People can’t travel or go on cruises or travel because of coronavirus, and the markets demonstrate this.  Delta airlines (DAL) is currently trading at $28.50. A few months ago, they were trading at $63. That is around a 60% discount on what it was at before. I believe it should go down lower. As it goes lower, I’m going to be looking to buy more and more of Delta and other airlines as well. I’m not looking to just jump into Delta only and not into other airlines. I want to diversify my risk. The potential gain for most of these airlines is pretty similar. I mitigate my risk of one of these airlines going under, but I can keep my gains consistent for the most part and increase my probability.    United (UAL) is at $31.55 today. A year ago it was $97. Just even just a few months ago, it was at $94.00. That is a 65% to 70% discount on United- absolutely insane. I personally think United will go down even lower than $31.55. The lowest it has been was a week ago when it was around $17.  I’m going to average into these positions as they continue to go lower because airlines will continue to drop but they will rise back up long term. How else will we travel? Are people never going to fly in a plane again? Are we going to walk across the continents? That’s not possible. Airlines are sticking around long-term. This is a great opportunity to get into airline stocks over the next 12- 18 months averaging in. There’s a pretty high probability 10 years from","Apr 4, 2020",https://stocknavigators.com/blog/5-best-stocks-to-buy-in-april-2020/
