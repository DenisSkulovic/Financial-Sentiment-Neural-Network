5,"The founder of JetBlue just launched a new US airline, aimed at routes that others have left behind | Markets Insider",". The founder of JetBlue just launched a new US airline, aimed at routes that others have left behind. SHARE","   Breeze  JetBlue founder David Neeleman launched his fifth start-up airline on Friday, announcing that the new carrier will be called Breeze. The airline, which was previously code-named Moxy, just submitted its application for an airline operating certificate with the Federal Aviation Administration and US Department of Transportation. The airline has been under discussion for several years as Neeleman worked to order aircraft and finalize plans.  After JetBlue, Neeleman — who was born in Brazil and raised in Utah — returned to Brazil, where he launched the low-cost airline Azul. Azul entered the Brazilian market by launching routes between dozens of small and mid-sized cities that previously did not have direct flights from Brazil's larger airlines. ""It's really transformed Brazil in ways I could have never imagined,"" Neeleman said in a 2019 interview with Business Insider. ""A lot of the cities we fly to, it's either you go on us or you take a four-day boat ride out of there."" Although there were operational challenges, the strategy paid off. Azul, which has a market capitalization of more than $2.8 billion, has no competition on 70% of its routes and is dominant of 89% of its routes, Neeleman said in that earlier interview.  With Breeze, Neeleman plans to follow essentially the same strategy, launching point-to-point flights in markets that bigger airlines have either overlooked, or didn't consider to be worth the effort. According to Neeleman, the opportunity exists because, as costs increase for airlines, they have a tendency to retrench their network to focus on their hubs and operate larger planes. They leave behind smaller, less trafficked destinations, creating opportunity. ""We think there's a market where you can go with a smaller plane with a lower trip cost and service these cities that have been forgotten or neglected,"" he said. ""I would be very surprised if a single Moxy"" — now Breeze — ""route had non-stop service competition. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of city pairs that are crying out for non-stop flights."" Breeze  The airline has ordered 60 new Airbus A220-300 aircraft — a longer version of the A220-100s that have been highly successful for Delta. Air Canada recently began flying the -300 variant. Breeze also plans to lease 30 Embraer E195 jets from Azul, which will begin being delivered in May 2020. The A220s are expected beginning in April 2021.

7,Cargo Airlines Continue to Fly to China - Air Market Group,Cargo Airlines Continue to Fly to China. Cargo Airlines Continue to Fly to China. Atlas Air Worldwide up 9% Today.,"Air Market Group  The Coronavirus has certainly shaken the aviation industry over the last few weeks. The first companies to see an immediate affect was the commercial airlines. With restrictions of travelling within certain areas of China in addition to tourism rates dropping down due to lack of demand the airlines quickly experienced some fear in the market. To date there has close to 600 deaths confirmed by China due to the Coronavirus. There has been over 30,000 confirmed cases of the virus reported from the local authorities. Some of the major concerns that the airlines have regarding travelling into China have been not only with the passengers but also with the crew. Many crew members have voiced how they feel uncomfortable flying into China based on the conditions present. UPS’ (NYSE: UPS) pilot union came to an agreement with the company allowing pilots to be able to make the decision on if they will be operating a flight travelling in or out of China. Should they decide they do not feel comfortable flying into the location they are able to take a personal day of leave on any flight leg that is flying through China. Many of the senior cargo airline pilots have had experience of operating relief flights into sensitive areas thus are a bit more experienced with the situation. Within the first 30 min of the day we have seen Atlas Air Worldwide Holding (NYSE: AAWW) rise up over 9% to then start to slowly settle down from the peak. Part of the reason behind the uptick of the company’s stock lies with the idea that more relief supplies will need to be sent into China. Traditionally cargo airlines are flying from China with full payload to then bring cargo out to locations around the world. Due to the current situation in China many flights are operating into China carry cargo in from other locations. Since commercial airlines are not permitted to land into certain airport, the supplies will need to be brought in on cargo aircraft. With Atlas Air having one of the largest fleets of B747 flying this is incredibly attractive for cargo brokers who are looking to quickly bring supplies into China. Although we are seeing price start to settle down after the initial peak there is still potential for the stock to continue to rise.

9,3 Smart Ways to Invest While Coronavirus Fears Spike | The Motley Fool,3 Smart Ways to Invest While Coronavirus Fears Spike. Heading to the sidelines would be a regrettable decision.. Stick to,"   Over the past two weeks, investors have been reminded that the stock market can go up and down. While a number of folks on Wall Street and Main Street had been looking for a pullback in equities after a more than 30% run higher, including dividend payouts, in the benchmark S&P 500 since 2019 began, essentially no one expected the reason for our recent decline would be fears surrounding a virus. Since mid-January, a novel form of coronavirus -- a type of virus that typically infects mammals and birds but has been shown to cause respiratory distress in humans -- that originated in Wuhan, within China's Hubei province, has proliferated at an alarming rate. With many aspects still unknown, including the incubation period, some 16,514 cases were confirmed as of midday Sunday, Feb. 2, with 360 deaths attributed to this novel coronavirus, per the World Health Organization.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. As you can imagine, fears of this spreading illness have shaken global markets. We've seen business activity slowed or shuttered in various parts of China, the world's second largest economy, with a number of major U.S. airlines among the latest to halt flights into the country. With the Wuhan coronavirus infecting far more people than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -- thankfully, leading to a lower mortality rate -- there's the possibility that we're bordering on a pandemic that could genuinely disrupt global growth for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, fear over a spreading illness has hit the stock market before. In no particular order, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the avian flu, Ebola, and SARS all wound up knocking between 6% and 12% (when rounded) off the S&P 500 over a period of a few weeks to a few months. This might have some investors thinking about playing a game of duck-and-cover on the sidelines. However, history tell us this would be a mistake. Here you'll find three ways you can continue to put your money to work in the stock market, even with coronavirus fears spiking. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. To begin with, consider investing into businesses that provide a basic-need good or service.

10,Stronger economic growth will have painful consequences: Jim Paulsen,Wall Street bull Jim Paulsen sees the economy getting stronger but warns of coming pain. ‘Stay fairly bullishly tilted’. MORE,"The Leuthold Group’s Jim Paulsen expects stocks to rally higher into record territory due to stronger economic and earnings growth. But his bullish forecast comes with a warning — and it has nothing to do with the coronavirus outbreak. “If we [economy] continue to grow, you’re going to see consumer prices, wages, commodity prices — cost in general — start to pressure business operations, household budgets and ultimately, the valuations of the stock market,” the firm’s chief investment strategist told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Wednesday. Even though he doesn’t have a timeline on when the economy could get squeezed, Paulsen calls the scenario the market’s “primary risk.” “That could happen quickly if economic growth spurts much more than anyone is thinking this year or it could drag out over a few years,” he said. Despite the risk, Paulsen isn’t ready to abandon his bullish stance. “Inflation is not a problem. So, until there’s some pressure, I think you’ve got to stay fairly bullishly tilted here,” he said. “Even though we’re going to have pullbacks, I think the economy is going to pick up. That may bring some pressures, but we certainly don’t have them yet.” He lists the ISM manufacturing pickup, low unemployment, strong consumer confidence and positive factory order data to support his near-term optimism. “Bond yields are really low. They haven’t even been climbing. The Fed has been easing. The money supplies are growing with quantitative easing. Fiscal juice is expanding relative to GDP. Foreign policy officials are doing the same thing,” he said. Paulsen, who correctly positioned for a market breakout at the end of last year, also cites earnings as a bullish driver. “Earnings season has been pretty good here for the fourth quarter overall,” added Paulsen. Yet, he’s not ignoring the coronavirus outbreak’s economic and business impact. Paulsen is watching the developments closely, but he suggests there’s no evidence the fallout will extend beyond this quarter. “It could get really serious,” Paulsen said. “But I think the right thing to do there is diversify. Everyone should be diversified. And beyond that, I don’t think you do much with it.” Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

All times below are in Eastern time. Total cases: More than 28,000 as of Thursday morning.
Total deaths: At least 565 worldwide as of Thursday morning The Pentagon identified 11 military installations near major airports that can support those evacuated from China, where the current outbreak originated. Department of Defense personnel won’t be in direct contact with the evacuees and will minimize contact with personnel supporting the evacuees, officials said. The bases are in Hawaii, Illinois, Texas, California, Georgia, New York, Washington state, New Jersey, Michigan and the District of Columbia. — Macias China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, reported an additional 69 deaths and 2,447 cases over the previous 24-hour period. The Hubei Provincial Health Committee said that this brings the total confirmed cases in the province to 22,112 and totals deaths in the province to 618. — Feuer The new coronavirus outbreak will be worse for the global economy than the 2003 SARS outbreak, IHS Markit predicts. Though estimates vary, economists say that the SARS outbreak in China cost the global economy about $40 billion. But during that 2003 outbreak, China was just the sixth-largest economy in the world, IHS Markit’s report says, accounting for 4.2% of the global economy. There’s more at stake now. Today, China is the second-largest economy, making up 16.3% of the world’s GDP. — Feuer History shows that stocks typically snap back fairly quickly from disease outbreaks. “On a forward-looking basis, dengue fever, swine flu, Ebola, measles, rubella, Zika, they don’t hurt the stock market that much,” said Dan Egan, managing director of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment. In 2016, the Zika virus, linked to birth defects in the babies of mothers infected while pregnant, tore through Latin America, the Caribbean and the U.S. The global stock market shed 6% a month after Zika took off. But six months later? It was down just around 0.6%. The deadly Ebola virus that broke out two years later dragged global stocks down more than 7%. Just half a year later, much of those losses rebounded. Stocks were down 2% in the immediate wake of the 2010 cholera outbreak, which eventually sickened more than 6% of Haitians.

12,3 Transportation ETFs to Leave at the Gate Before Frustration Takes Over | InvestorPlace,3 Transportation ETFs to Leave at the Gate. These transportation ETFs are scuffling mightily to start 2020. iShares Transportation Average," Source: Shutterstock January brought a brisk start to 2020 for investors. Between a gusher of earnings reports and the new coronavirus outbreak, a new story is seeping into February. Lost in all that commotion are some deeper market trends, including the laggard status of transportation equities. Over the course of history, market observers have often used the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index as a tell for upcoming moves on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but the transport’s gauge doesn’t seem to be getting the attention it used to. That might be a good thing because, to start 2020, the transportation index is up just 0.2% while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) is higher by 3.4%. Here’s another not-so-fun fact for transportation fans: the Dow Jones Transportation Average topped SPY just twice in the six years spanning 2014 to 2019. For investors currently mulling transportation exchange traded funds, the good news at the moment may just be that there’s a limited universe (just seven) to examine. For patient market participants, there are some forward-looking funds that may be worth a glance in the future, but for now it may be best to leave most transportation ETFs sitting on the tarmac.

Currently, IYT faces multiple problems. First, there’s the fund’s 17.31% weight to airlines, a group that will be pinched by the coronavirus epidemic. Remember the SARS pandemic earlier this century? It cost global airlines $7 billion, but that figure could be significantly higher when the “Wuhan virus” issue is finally put to bed. Even if one argues that IYT’s airline components are American carriers, which is true, that doesn’t carry the day because some domestic airlines are canceling China flights and that’s lost revenue. Even if an investor is bold enough to gloss over the near-term airline issue with this transportation ETF, there’s another, longer-ranging scenario to ponder: the changing mix of American energy consumption. IYT allocates 36.48% of its weight to railroad operators, many of which haul coal and other fossil fuels. As has been noted, those aren’t the places to be in the energy world these days.

Seize a share opportunity," We highlight three key things for investors ahead of Singapore Airlines Group’s Q3 earnings report. Singapore’s national carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group is announcing its third quarter FY2019/2020 financial results for the three months ended 31 December 2019, next Friday 14 February. SIA has been ranked as the world's best airline by Skytrax four times and topped Travel & Leisure magazine's best airline rankings for more than 20 years. The aviation group owns several subsidiaries, including regional flight arm Silkair, low-cost carrier Scoot, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul company SIA Engineering. Go long or short on thousands of international stocks. Ahead of the Q3 results announcement, we highlight three key things that investors should note. Between October and December 2019, passenger load factor for the group’s three carriers increased by an average of 2.73% to 85.63%, according to numbers already posted on its website. Total passengers carried across the last three months of the year was 10.05 million, up 8.64% from 2018’s Q3 total of 9.26 million. In December 2019, SIA Group airlines' passenger carriage (measured in revenue passenger-kilometres) grew 7.9% compared to last year, outpacing capacity (measured in available seat-kilometres) growth of 4.8%. Passenger load factor (PLF) rose by 2.6 percentage points to 87.6%. For November 2019, passenger carriage grew 8.3% compared to last year, outpacing capacity growth of 4.4%. PLF rose by 3.1 percentage points to 84.9%. October 2019 saw a PLF increment of 2.5% to 84.4%. Do you own Singapore Airlines shares? Hedge your downside risks by trading CFDs with IG today. The group achieved a net profit of S$206 million in the first half (H1) of the financial year, S$10 million (+5.1%) higher than last year. Revenue rose S$418 million (+5.3%), primarily from strong growth in passenger flown revenue which grew 8.2% to S$514 million. However, this was partially offset by a reduction of S$138 million in cargo flown revenue, alongside higher expenditure (+$431 million or 5.8%) that reflected enlarged operations. The performance deterioration in the cargo segment was mainly due to an overall drop in airfreight demand amid US-China trade tensions, and a slowdown in exports from key manufacturing countries in Europe and Asia. Regional commercial arm SilkAir also continued to struggle, as it turned in another quarter of operating losses, as it remained adversely affected by the global grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft.

14,American Airlines is transforming the way it shares profits with employees,". . . . . . . . . This year’s Rose Bowl, one of the two CFP semifinal matchups,","  BUSINESSAIRLINES By Kyle Arnold 6:30 AM on Feb 7, 2020 CST American Airlines is poised to double the cut of earnings it gives back to employees in profit sharing, trying to match the massive payouts competitor Delta Air Lines awards its workers. With the proposed contract extended to 30,000 mechanics and maintenance workers on Jan. 30, Fort Worth-based American is offering to more than double its current profit share to 10% on pre-tax earnings up to $2.5 billion and 20% on pre-tax earnings over $2.5 billion. That would dwarf the 5% of pre-tax earnings that American shares with employees now.   Leaders at the unions representing pilots and flight attendants say they expect a similar profit-sharing program from their contracts now under negotiations. And since American started profit-sharing in 2016, the company has extended the same cut to all employees not part of the executive management team, although it’s still to be determined if non-union employees would get the same bump. The profit-sharing is just a sliver of the $4.2 billion contract American struck with unions representing maintenance workers. The contract, which is awaiting ratification, also awards 4% to 18% raises, $3,000 to $6,000 signing bonuses and limits on how much work can be given to outside contractors. It also gives an important psychological lift to employees who see bigger profit-sharing bonuses at other airlines. “What’s important is that the economic gains in this contract match or surpass what is happening at other airlines,” said John Samuelson, International President for the Transport Workers Union, which represents legacy American Airlines workers at the company. Researchers have proven that being helpful to others releases dopamine — the “feel-good” chemical — in our brains and lights up the same... American Airlines employees have had to watch year-after-year while competing carriers gave jaw-dropping profit sharing to employees. This year, Delta gave $1.6 billion back to employees, a bonus equal to about two months of pay. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines announced Thursday that its employees would get a bonus worth about six weeks of pay based on the $667 million accrued last year. “Delta is the standout in the airline industry in terms of percent of pay from profit sharing and Southwest has been doing it for 40-something years,” said Joseph Blasi, director of Rutgers University’s Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and Profit Sharing. “That’s left American Airlines at the back.”","Feb 7, 2020",https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2020/02/07/american-airlines-is-transforming-the-way-it-shares-profits-with-employees/

19,Southwest Airlines to Give Its Employees $667 Million Profit-Sharing Bonus | KTLA,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"KTLA by: CNN Wire Southwest Airlines had a particularly rough 2019, but it still managed to turn a profit. As part of an annual tradition, Southwest is sharing that profit with employees. The airline announced Thursday it’s giving 60,000 employees a $667 million profit-sharing bonus. That means some eligible employees will soon receive a check for 12.2% of their annual salary, which is the equivalent of roughly an additional six weeks of pay. Other employees will get the contribution added to their retirement accounts. “Our employees delivered outstanding results despite a challenging year, and it’s a pleasure to reward our people for all they contribute to our continued success,” said Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly in a statement. Southwest’s profit fell 6.7% last year, hampered by the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max and several federal investigations. But it’s not taking that out on its employees. Roughly $125 million of the bonus comes from compensation Boeing gave the airline. The two companies reached a confidential agreement in December for the grounding. Southwest has 34 Max planes in its fleet, the most of any airline in the world. Southwest’s profit-sharing plan has been in place for 46 years. It was the first airline to enact this kind of bonus, and it has given nearly $6 billion to its employees. But this year’s bonus was smaller than that of one of its rivals: Delta Air Lines recently paid its 90,000 employees a record $1.6 billion in profit-sharing bonuses, amounting to an additional two months’ pay. It was the sixth year in a row that the company has paid out more than $1 billion to workers, Delta said. Size doesn’t matter in this case. Employee payouts are good for business, according to Joseph Blasi, director of the Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and Profit Sharing at Rutgers University. “Research shows that cash profit-sharing plans, combined with a supportive corporate culture that encourages employees to offer suggestions and participate in solving company problems, can reduce turnover and improve corporate performance and personal motivation.” Direct cash payments are not the only way companies can share profits with workers. Some make profit-sharing contributions to workers’ retirement accounts or pay them in stock. Profit sharing is one way to demonstrate what members of the Business Roundtable have said is a corporation’s purpose: to serve all stakeholders, including employees. Delta and Southwest are hardly the only","Feb 6, 2020",https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/southwest-airlines-to-give-its-employees-667-million-profit-sharing-bonus/
