0,"United Airlines Stock Fell Too Far on China Fears, Goldman Says | Barron's","United Airlines Stock Has Fallen Too Far on China Fears, Goldman Sachs Says. A United Airlines jet lands in San","  Economic weakness in China could be a problem for United Continental Holdings, but investors are more worried than they need to be, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Catherine O’Brien. She upgraded shares of United Continental (ticker: UAL) from Neutral to Buy on Thursday, keeping her price target at $108 per share, 30% higher than recent levels, saying losses in the stock create a potential opportunity. O’Brien says United stock is too cheap now
that it has declined more than 16% from its 52-week high, set last December. ( American Airlines (AAL) shares, by contrast, have fallen further
than United, but O’Brien already rates American at Buy with a $42 price target, 40% higher than recent levels.)   The back story. Airlines, as a group, are still modestly valued, trading for less than 10 times estimated 2019 earnings on average. Investors aren’t convinced the industry consolidation that produced four major U.S. airlines, down from six several year ago, will produce consistently higher profits. United is one of the most modestly valued U.S. airlines, trading at 7.3 times estimated 2019 earnings, a big discount to stocks in the S&P 500, which trade for 16.9 times estimated 2019 earnings on average. Southwest Airlines (LUV), by contrast, trades for 11.1 times estimated 2019 earnings and American Airlines trades for just 6 times estimated earnings. Delta Air Lines ’ (DAL) valuation multiple falls in between those two, at 8.2 times. What’s new. O’Brien thinks investors’ concerns about pricing and exposure to the Chinese economy have weighed on United stock, creating an opportunity. China exposure for United, while higher than other U.S. airlines, represents only 4% of United’s capacity. O’Brien says the company’s exposure to China is down from recent years. What’s more, she believes any pricing concerns are already reflected in the stock price. She also thinks a new credit-card agreement with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) will generate unexpected benefits for United shareholders. “United management has highlighted that it sees margin upside to reaching a co-brand credit card agreement with economics more on par with its two largest competitors,” writes O’Brien in her Thursday research report. The impact from the new credit card deal could be significant, adding more than 10% to estimated earnings per share, according to the analyst. Looking ahead. Lower oil prices will also help airline earnings in the short run. Benchmark crude-oil prices fell 16% in May.

1,American's CEO Just Bought More American Stock | One Mile at a Time,American’s CEO Just Bought More American Stock. American management buys more American stock. What should we make of this?. Bottom,"Travel in the Time of COVID: The news, resources, & information you need Update: On August 27, 2019, American’s stock hit a new five year low. American’s management team sure is putting their money where their mouth is. No, not when it comes to actually making positive changes at the airline, but rather when it comes to investing in the airline’s stock. Yesterday American CEO Doug Parker purchased a further 50,000 shares of American Airlines stock, at a cost of $28.09 per share, or just over $1.4 million total. He wasn’t the only one to invest in American yesterday, as six other top executives at American bought a combined 35,000 shares yesterday. Historically Doug Parker’s compensation has largely been paid in stock rather than cash. At this point he owns a total of just over 2.2 million shares of American stock, currently valued at just over $60 million. It seems like American’s top management thinks that the stock has more or less hit rock bottom, and things are going to get better from here. As I wrote about last week, American’s stock has just hit a three year low. Or maybe they’re just trying to get us to believe that’s the case. On one hand I respect management that believes in their company. At the same time, in spite of Doug Parker having lost tens of millions of dollars as American’s stock price has plummeted over the past year, he can’t actually seem to bother to make changes at the airline that could have a positive impact. So this makes me wonder why American’s management team thinks things are going to get better. American is going to have huge labor issues in the coming months, so to me it sure seems like things will get worse before they get better. My guess is that this is just Parker being optimistic.After all, he’s not a great predictor of American’s stock price.  In late 2017 when American’s stock was in the high $40s, Parker said the “stock is so undervalued it defies logic.” It’s interesting to see seven of American’s top executives buying more stock. It makes me wonder if management is finally reaching a point where they’re coming to their senses, or what they know that we don’t. While American’s stock may basically be at a three year low, it sure seems like it has the potential to get even","Jun 5, 2019",https://onemileatatime.com/american-ceo-bought-more-stock/

CNBC Newsletters","Trouble in the tech space has created some timely buys, according to one expert. The broader technology sector has shed more than 6% in the last month as concerns around the U.S.-China trade war affecting the U.S. tech industry took hold in the stock market. Semiconductor companies have been among the biggest losers, with Nvidia shares falling more than 22%. But parts of the tech space have now gotten so bad that they actually look good on an investment basis, Matt Maley, equity strategist and managing director at Miller Tabak, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “Some of them look quite good here and really washed out, and I think there’s a good chance that they’ll bounce,” he said. Nvidia, which manufactures semiconductor chips for graphics, gaming and artificial intelligence capabilities, was his first pick based on some positive signs in its stock chart.  “Here’s a stock that, in the last couple of days, has tested its 200-week moving average. That line provided excellent support back in December and the stock ... [is] incredibly oversold,” Maley said, citing the low levels on its momentum-focused relative strength index indicator. “I think it’s going to bounce back quite strongly over the next few days, or even the next couple of weeks.” Maley saw a similar situation occurring in Google parent Alphabet, which recently tested a trend line from 2015 and also appeared to be oversold. “I think it will hold that line and bounce back nicely as well,” he said. “But one that’s a little bit more dicey is Salesforce.” The technical expert hesitated to make a definitive call on Salesforce ahead of its Tuesday evening earnings report, noting that the stock recently broke below its 200-day moving average, typically a bearish sign. But, he said, “if they can get a good earnings report out, it should snap right back,” a prediction that played out after Salesforce beat earnings and revenue estimates and saw its stock pop in after-hours trading. If the breakout is meaningful, it will give Salesforce shares “another 10% [of] upside,” Maley said. “So that one’s a little bit more dicey ... but the other ones I think are so washed out that the rally that we’ll see in these names will last them more than just a day or two.” Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, wasn’t as bullish on the high-growth tech space. “As","Jun 5, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/05/these-3-beaten-down-tech-stocks-are-so-bad-theyre-good-strategist.html
4,Falling Oil Prices Will Boost Spirit Airlines' Bottom Line | The Motley Fool,"Falling Oil Prices Will Boost Spirit Airlines' Bottom Line. Oil prices have plummeted in the past couple of weeks, significantly","   A renewed spike in global trade tensions and evidence that economic growth is slowing have combined to send the stock market tumbling over the past month or so. Airline stocks including Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) have been caught in the downdraft. In fact, Spirit Airlines stock, which hit a recent peak near the $65 mark in late 2018, has since fallen more than 20% to around $50.  SPIRIT AIRLINES STOCK PERFORMANCE DATA BY YCHARTS. However, Spirit Airlines' position as a budget carrier targeting leisure travelers means that trade wars and slower global growth shouldn't hurt it very much. Domestic consumer spending, a more relevant metric for Spirit, remains fairly strong. Moreover, the recent economic turmoil has caused oil prices to plunge, which will provide significant cost savings for airlines. For each of its past two quarters, Spirit Airlines has posted strong unit revenue growth, enabling it to nearly double its earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. Spirit's outlook for the current quarter isn't too shabby, either. Analysts expect adjusted EPS to soar 48% to $1.64 this quarter. That would put the company's EPS growth for the first half of the year at 60%. Spirit Airlines will face tougher comparisons, though. In the first half of 2018, the carrier's revenue per available seat mile (RASM) declined 4.6% year over year. By contrast, RASM returned to strong growth in the back half of the year, starting with a 5.5% increase in the third quarter. As a result, the analyst consensus currently calls for EPS growth to slow to 22% next quarter: barely more than Spirit's projected revenue growth of 15%. Analysts expect negligible earnings growth in the fourth quarter, when year-over-year comparisons will be the toughest. Perhaps because of this projected slowdown in earnings growth, Spirit Airlines stock currently trades for a bargain valuation of less than nine times forward earnings. Yet the recent plunge in oil prices means that EPS growth may not slow as much as investors seem to fear. SPIRIT AIRLINES STOCK IS EXTREMELY CHEAP FOR A HIGH-GROWTH COMPANY.

5,Portugal's TAP airline expected to float shares soon -Euronext | Reuters,Portugal's TAP airline expected to float shares soon -Euronext. . . . . . . . . . . .,"Discover Thomson Reuters More By Reuters Staff 2 MIN READ LISBON, June 6 (Reuters) - Portugal’s flag carrier TAP-Air Portugal is preparing the ground for an expected initial public offering of its shares, the head of listings at Euronext Lisbon bourse said on Thursday. TAP, which was partly privatised in 2015, is 50-percent owned by the Portuguese state. Private consortium Atlantic Gateway, led by Brazilian-U.S. airline mogul David Neeleman, has a 45 percent stake. TAP employees hold the remaining 5 percent. “TAP is already doing the preparatory work, communicating with the market, presenting its results, which is not very common for privately owned companies,” Filipa Franco told Reuters. She said a four-year debenture loan worth at least 50 million euros ($56.47 million) that the company plans to list on Euronext on June 24 “will be a rehearsal for TAP so within some time, not very long, it can carry out its IPO.” She added that she was in regular contact with the company. TAP declined to comment but officials from the airline have previously said they were considering an IPO at some point in the future. Portugal’s IPO scene has been in the doldrums for years. While peer-to-peer lending platform Raize last year completed the country’s first public listing since 2014, others have struggled, with retailer Sonae, porcelain maker Vista Alegre and toymaker Science4You all ditching planned IPOs. Franco said she expected more companies to fund their growth by issuing shares. “The only way for our companies to remain Portuguese and at the same time grow on a global level is for them to seek international capital at the bourse. If they do it via private transactions they’ll cease being Portuguese,” Franco said.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   After a strong gain on Tuesday, the stock market returned to a more conservative tone on Wednesday morning as investors tried to get their bearings following comments from the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Even as many market participants celebrated the apparent openness from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials to consider lowering interest rates if economic conditions deteriorate, long-held concerns about trade and global economic conditions kept stocks from making too many further advances. As of 11:30 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was up 138 points to 25,470. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gained 13 points to 2,816, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) was higher by 23 points to 7,550. Some stocks have responded to macroeconomic factors in other financial markets, and one of the most important has been the recent plunge in oil prices. Falling crude has sent oil services specialists like Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) for a loop, but at the same time, they've been good news for airlines like American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) that count fuel as one of their largest expenses. Shares of Halliburton were down 4% on Wednesday morning, generally following a trend among a broader range of oil services stocks. The move came at the same time that crude oil fell another $2 per barrel, dropping below $51.50 and leading some to predict a drop to $50. The reason for falling oil prices might not be evident in the U.S., where economic activity remains robust. However, demand has weakened across other areas of the globe, and suppliers haven't coordinated successfully to try to limit the amount of crude that's available. At the same time, energy players in the U.S. have boosted production in response to the upward movement in oil prices that the market saw in 2018, and it'll take time for the market to adjust if they decide to curtail their operations.

9,How fast are earnings growing among FTSE 100 stocks? | Shares Magazine,How fast are earnings growing among FTSE 100 stocks?. The names delivering earnings expansion and how they are valued. Issue,"Which blue-chip stocks have the fastest earnings growth? By using market screening tools and comparing growth with valuation we have come up with some useful insights which could provide the basis for further research. RELIABLE GROWTH OR DANGER AHEAD? Employing data from Stockopedia we measured earnings growth for FTSE 100 constituents over two periods, five years and 10 years. Using two sets of data tells us whether growth has been a) consistent over the past 10 years, b) faster over the first five years and slower over the last five years, or c) slower over the first five years and faster more recently. This is crucial because the danger with ‘growth’ stocks is that eventually they tend to go ex-growth. When they do, in theory they should de-rate but well-loved stocks can sometimes defy gravity for quite a while, propped up by bullish broker reviews and a positive consensus among the fund management community. When stocks which are trading on elevated multiples can no longer meet earnings estimates the market’s judgement is typically harsh. For example, in mid-April catering supplies company Bunzl (BNZL), for years the epitome of a reliable growth stock, disappointed investors. Its shares, which were trading on over 20 times forecast earnings, slumped by 12% and have yet to recover. According to our screen there are 16 large-cap stocks trading on a rolling 12-month forward earnings multiple of 20 times or more, as per table A in this article. We have used a rolling 12-month basis as it smooths the transition from this financial year to the next by incorporating elements of both.  SOME STOCKS ARE CHEAP FOR A REASON At the other end of the spectrum there are 13 stocks trading on nine times 12-month forward earnings or less with most more than 50% below their 10-year share price highs – see table B. To put this into perspective, a stock trading at a 50% discount to its highest price of the last decade would have   to more than double to make a new high. In some cases these are serial low-growth stocks, such as cigarette-maker British American Tobacco (BATS), ex-monopoly telecom operator BT (BT.A) and medical and industrial equipment-supplier Smiths Group (SMIN). Stocks which barely grow their earnings typically trade at low multiples and they make up for the lack of re-rating potential with chunky dividends.

What are Stock,"Stock prices tell us the amount someone is willing to pay for a company’s shares at a particular time. Market analysts use a business’s past and present performance to predict future outcomes and determine a share’s cash worth. The price of a stock typically fluctuates since a wide range of factors contribute to the cost.

The value of a stock is based on a business’s past and present earnings, market share, sales volume over time, and other similar factors. The price tells us how much a buyer is willing to pay and for how low a company is willing to sell its stocks. Somewhere in the middle lies the actual price.  A stock’s price and value are usually within the same ballpark. However, sometimes stock prices can be much higher or lower than their value. Stocks have two prices, which are: When demand is higher than supply, stock prices go up. When supply is higher than demand, stock prices decrease. To understand the value of a stock, the following must be examined: Companies often sell stocks for more or less than their intrinsic value.

A European airline has added non-binary,"Air Italy will now allow travelers to choose nonbinary gender options when booking flights. The new policy makes the Alitalia competitor the first airline based in Europe to provide passengers with these options. Earlier this year, United Airlines UAL, -2.48%   became the first U.S. airline to institute the change. Other airlines, including American AAL, -1.73%  , Delta DAL, -1.05%  , Southwest LUV, -0.78%  , Alaska ALK, +0.36%  and JetBlue JBLU, +0.49%  , have said they are in the process of updating their booking processes as well. Moving forward, Air Italy passengers will be allowed to select X (other) as opposed to M (male) or F (female) when asked for their gender. Additionally, the non-binary honorific Mx was added to the dropdown list of titles for those who opt not to provide a gender. “The decision of a first-tier airline like Air Italy to invest resources and time to focus on inclusivity, is a positive example that we hope is followed by others,” said Gabriele Piazzoni, general secretary of Arcigay, Italy’s largest LGBT organization, in a statement that accompanied the airline’s announcement. “The civil progress of a country depends not only on its laws, but also by the way in which the private sector puts in place anti-discrimination initiatives that take into consideration the many differences that exist,” Piazzoni added.

12,Does Air Canada (TSE:AC) Have A Good P/E Ratio? - Simply Wall St News,Does Air Canada (TSE:AC) Have A Good P/E Ratio?. How Do I Calculate Air Canada's Price To Earnings Ratio?. Is,"Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card! This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). To keep it practical, we'll show how Air Canada's (TSE:AC) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Air Canada has a P/E ratio of 14.96. That means that at current prices, buyers pay CA$14.96 for every CA$1 in trailing yearly profits. See our latest analysis for Air Canada The formula for price to earnings is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for Air Canada: P/E of 14.96 = CA$39.41 ÷ CA$2.63 (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2019.) The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.' Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings. Air Canada's earnings per share fell by 61% in the last twelve months. But over the longer term (3 years), earnings per share have increased by 1.5%. The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that Air Canada has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the airlines industry average (15.7). Its P/E ratio suggests that Air Canada shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. The company could surprise by performing better than average, in the future. I inform my view byby checking management tenure and remuneration, among other things. The 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company.

We explain what you need to know about the rivalry and explore whether they can continue their ascent. Boeing was established in 1916 and its first planes, the Model C’s, were immediately put to action when the US entered World War One. But Boeing was also a pioneer in non-military aircraft, creating the first purpose-built commercial planes designed to ship mail from coast-to-coast and from the US to Canada. The unit that managed its postal business went on to merge with several other companies in the early 1930s to form United Airlines, which was forcefully separated from the rest of the business by the US government. Boeing created the first ever plane to make a profit purely from carrying passengers in 1936 and its planes were responsible for carrying 90% of traffic by 1939. But, as World War Two erupted, Boeing was once again drawn into the conflict. Its commercial planes were stripped of their plush interiors and used to shift cargo to war-torn areas of Europe and it didn’t take long for military demand to take precedence over the needs of commercial clients. The first US fighters were soon battling the Germans (who had managed to capture up to 50 Boeing aircraft that had been kept in France). While Boeing’s foundations lie in supplying military aircraft, the company quickly learnt the importance of commercial models able to carry cargo and cater to the growing number of people flying to their destination. For example, the US Navy halved its orders for patrol seaplanes once World War One ended, prompting its move into mail by designing the first plane able to carry a load heavier than itself in 1921. The cycle of World War Two was even more severe. Although US aircraft had proven integral for the US and its European allies, over 70,000 direct Boeing employees lost their jobs after the end of the war with another 150,000 becoming unemployed across the wider supply chain. Although US foreign policy ensured Boeing’s military division had plenty","Jun 5, 2019",https://www.ig.com/en-ch/news-and-trade-ideas/shares-news/airbus-vs-boeing--what-you-need-to-know-about-the-stocks-190225

Now","Why American Airlines Stock Dropped 20% in May 为什么美国航空公司5月份股票下跌20% 发生了什么 根据S&P Global市场情报提供的数据，上个月，美国航空集团(NASDAQ:AAL)的股价下跌了20.3%。今年4月底，该公司公布了综合第一季度收益报告，盈利超过了分析师的预期，但收入略低于预期。 这家美国航空公司的股票最初因消息反弹而反弹，但在5月初，一名分析师下调了波音股票，这对航空业的其他部门产生了溢出效应。此次降级是根据分析师开展的一项调查做出的，该调查显示，乘客计划根据飞机类型来选择航班。 除了燃料成本不断上涨，这次调查给航空公司带来了额外的障碍。在波音降级之后，整个航空公司的股票开始剧烈抛售，一直持续到5月底。  想像来源：形象化。 那么，什么？ MAX737的停运是最近几个月主要的航空公司航班计划的中断。不过，航空公司投资者没有理会最近取消航班带来的影响，预计波音737MAX不久将再次起飞，这将使各大航空公司恢复正常。 然而，如果有更多的乘客完全避开737MAX，那就意味着飞机完全失去了乘客的信任，这在短期内给航空公司带来了额外的阻力，投资者并不指望这一点。由于华尔街通常痛恨不确定性,因此航空公司类股上个月销售一空不足为奇. 现在 美国航空公司称，今年夏季，其总载客量的2%受到737MAX的搁浅影响。这仅占美国舰队的一小部分，但管理层指出，公司仍然负责运营整个舰队。因此，该公司预计今年取消税前利润将减少大约3.5亿美元。 不过，管理层预计全年收入比2018年大约增长10%，分析师预计今年的收入将增长4.1%。 即便面临最近的挑战，CEO道格•帕克也对长期前景持乐观态度：“展望2020年及以后，我们预计随着历史车队更换项目的结束，我们自由现金流的产量将大幅增加。我们非常看好未来，注重为我们的股东创造价值。 Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) lost 20.3% in value last month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company announced a mixed first-quarter earnings report in late April, with earnings exceeding analysts' expectations but revenue coming in slightly below estimates.  American Airlines stock initially rebounded on the news, but in early May, Boeing stock was downgraded by one analyst, which had a spillover effect to the rest of the airline industry. The downgrade was based on a survey conducted by the analyst revealing that passengers plan to choose flights based on the type of aircraft after the recent crashes involving the new Boeing 737 MAX. The survey presents an additional obstacle the airlines have to deal with in the short term, on top of rising fuel costs. After the Boeing downgrade, airline stocks across the board began a hard sell-off that continued through the end of May.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The grounding of the 737 MAX has been a disruption to flight schedules for the major airlines in recent months. However, airline investors had brushed off the impact of the recent flight cancellations, expecting that the 737 MAX would start flying again soon, which would get the major airlines back to normal performance.  However, if more passengers avoid the 737 MAX altogether, that means the aircraft has totally lost the trust of passengers -- and that presents an additional headwind to the airlines in the short term that investors hadn't counted on. Since Wall Street typically hates uncertainty, it's not surprising that airline stocks sold off last month. American Airlines says that 2% of its total capacity is impacted each day this summer by the grounding of the 737 MAX. This represents a tiny percentage of American's fleet, but management pointed out that the company is still footing the bill to operate the entire fleet. As a result, the company expects the cancellations to cut about $350 million off pre-tax earnings this year.  Still, management expects full-year earnings to be up approximately 10% compared to 2018, while analysts expect revenue to increase by 4.1% this year.  Even with the recent challenges, CEO Doug Parker is optimistic about the long term: ""As we look forward to 2020 and","Jun 6, 2019",https://www.lotgain.com/why-american-airlines-stock-dropped-20-in-may%E4%B8%BA%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E8%88%AA%E7%A9%BA%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B85%E6%9C%88%E4%BB%BD%E8%82%A1%E7%A5%A8%E4%B8%8B%E8%B7%8C20/

By CCN.com: A break-neck rally in the Dow Jones has the bullish analysts leaping back out of their hiding places. Perhaps the most outlandish call came from Yves Lamoureux, who believes the Dow will skyrocket to 40,000 within two years, only to languish there for an entire decade. Lamoureux MarketWatch: “It will be what we call a ‘generational top’, where the Dow will climb to 30,000 then 40,000 as an eventual high, but then plateau for a decade.” When looking at Lamoureux’s forecast, it’s obvious this we have an uber bull on our hands. The analyst goes on to laughably suggest that he is the only one looking at investor psychology. “What I’m expecting…is another big move, in which people really go nuts. That’s what’s kind of missing here. What separates me from everybody else is we study psychology, and what I find particularly odd now is there has been a very big flight of money out of stocks to bonds.” Frankly, when you consider the fundamentals that have pushed the Dow higher over the last decade, it does appear plausible that the index can continue to rocket higher. As long as you don’t look too closely. You can’t deny that the bull case is solid. First, you have abysmally low yields on cash deposits. You can’t make any money with a bank account, so investors have to seek riskier assets.

18,Delays In Boeing's 737 MAX And 777X Could Weigh On Stock,MORE FROM FORBES. Delays In Boeing's 737 MAX And 777X Could Weigh On Stock. How Creativity Became Essential To Getting,"This photo taken on June 5, 2019 shows grounded China Southern Airlines Boeing 737 MAX aircraft... [+] If I were a Boeing shareholder, I'd be weighing whether the decline in its stock price -- down 21% from its March 1, 2019 high -- is due to temporary or much deeper problems. If the problems are temporary, I would consider buying more. Otherwise, I would be inclined to take my profits. The bull case for Boeing is that the 737 MAX -- which has been grounded for 12 weeks, according to the Seattle Times -- will go back in service sometime within the next year and eventually passengers will abandon their fear of flying in it. And despite delays in producing the Boeing 777X -- the replacement for the 747 -- on lighter-than-expected demand and engine problems, the problems will eventually be solved. Most importantly, given that it only has Airbus as a competitor and the barriers to entry in the industry are so high, Boeing's market opportunity remains enormous and its new products will continue to gobble up market share.  The bear case rests on three planks. First, if Boeing's reputation has been so badly damaged that passengers will not fly on the 737 MAX, airlines will stop flying them. Second, Boeing's profits could decline if 787 manufacturing quality control problems heighten the push by the FAA and other global regulators to take a much tougher stance on letting its aircraft fly. Finally, demand for new aircraft could drop should a global recession hit. These thoughts are prompted by recent news about the fix to the 737 MAX and hints of possible delays in producing Boeing's 777X aircraft. 737 MAX fix   PROMOTED Boeing has released to regulators its fix of the system suspected of having caused the March 2019 Lion Air and October 2018 Ethiopian Air crashes that claimed 346 lives, according to the Seattle Times. Whereas the old version of the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS) system is being investigated as the cause of two crashes, Boeing's new version of the software for the anti-stall system on the 737 MAX appears to work. That's good because the old version of MCAS sounds scary to me. According to the Wall Street Journal, soon after takeoff a simulator which the author observed, warned pilots that the plane was about to stall due to an incorrect signal from a","Jun 6, 2019",https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/06/06/delays-in-boeings-737-max-and-777x-could-weigh-on-stock/
