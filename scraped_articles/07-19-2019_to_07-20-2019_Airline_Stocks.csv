1,McDonald's is among 5 stocks that have surged since 1969 moon landing,These five stocks are the best performers since man landed on the moon. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC,"Houston, we have liftoff. Fifty years ago, man landed on the moon and a handful of stocks took off into the stratosphere. Since July 1969, McDonald’s has rocketed more than 82,000%, Lowe’s nearly 70,000%, Altria 49,000%, Hasbro 43,000% and Disney 40,000%.  At least one of those stocks still has more fuel in its jet, says Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray. “If you look at McDonald’s, it’s been a slow and steady burn higher here in this stock and from our perspective, there’s been this really nice price channel that’s been unfolding over the past five years,” Johnson said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”  “A move to the upper end of the price channel can put this stock up toward $265, so from our perspective that’s one that we would continue to focus on,” said Johnson. A rally to $265 implies 23% upside from current levels. It would also mark a record for the stock, which hit an all-time high Thursday. “The second stock is Disney,” Johnson added. “This stock has been forming a really nice consolidation over the last five years. It recently just broke out. We added it into our model portfolio and from our perspective based upon the size of the breakout, we could see this stock moving up toward $160. So clearly this is a stock that has more room to run.”  Disney could add another 13% before it hits $160, also a record high for the stock, which hit an all-time peak a week ago. Quint Tatro, president of Joule Financial, says Disney is the best in show among the top winners over the last half century. “This is a company that continues to reinvent themselves. We like them. We own them. We do believe in the next 50 years, we’ll still be talking about Disney,” said Tatro. However, Tatro is more excited about the companies whose innovation will dominate the consumer space, and stock market, over the next 50 years. “We do like what we believe are the future of great American franchise companies like an Uber or a Lyft and, I know not very popular, but our belief is that these industry-revolutionizing companies are going to be the ones that compound over the next several decades and the ones that provide the great opportunities going forward,” said Tatro.

2,Small caps have trailed the market and it could get worse,"An underperforming corner of the market is about to get worse, trader says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC","The major indexes are within reach of record highs, but one technician sees trouble brewing in the market that could lead to a pullback. “We’re starting to see hesitation here in the broader indexes … and so far earnings season has been greeted with a bit of a thud,” said TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “If you look at the S&P here in blue, you’re starting to see some hesitation. Each rally that we’ve seen has been shorter than the prior, momentum indicators are starting to roll over indicating ... buying interest is waning.”  The S&P 500 has hit a series of all-time highs this month, most recently on Monday. Since hitting a 52-week low in December, it has surged nearly 30%. Now, Gordon sees weakness coming to equities, and he’s taking advantage of a retreat in one of the worst-performing corners of the market. “I do believe a pullback is coming. Rather than shorting the relatively stronger S&P, Nasdaq, or the Dow — let’s focus and pick on the weak one, which is the Russell,” the index composed of small-cap stocks, Gordon said. While the rest of the market has rallied to records, the Russell 2000 has not hit a new high since August. It is also negative for the past three months, while the S&P 500 has added more than 3%. “Prior to 2019, the Russell was right on top of the S&P. But, recently as the S&P has gone to a new high, the Russell has not. I would like to take advantage of a potential move back down towards these lows,” he said. Gordon sees a drop to $145 on the IWM Russell 2000 ETF, which mirrors the index. That implies 7% downside from the levels of the ETF. He said to see this happen he would also need the S&P 500 to weaken. To take advantage of a move lower, Gordon is buying the August 16 expiration 150 put and selling the 145 put. This spread pays off if the IWM ETF falls as low as $145 by expiration. Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

3,The Virgin share price is down 9.7% YTD: is it a buy?,. . . . . . . . . The Virgin share price is down 9.7% YTD: is it a,"      Chris Chitty | July 19, 2019 4:20pm | More on: VAH The Virgin Australia Holdings Limited (ASX: VAH) share price is down 9.7% so far in 2019, making it a good time for investors to add this company to their portfolios. Virgin Australia is the operator of Virgin Australia Airlines. Together with airline partners, Virgin Australia operates flights on both domestic and international routes. The group’s aircrafts fly to 45 Australian destinations and 17 international destinations. Virgin also operates budget airline Tigerair Australia.  While the group reported a loss after tax for the 2018 financial year and is set to do so again in 2019, there is a silver lining. First, Virgin’s losses last year were mostly caused by non-cash accounting items. This included more than $570 million of non-cash charges to the group’s accounting statements. While these may affect the overall value of the company, they do not affect the cash flow that the company earned last year. Underlying earnings, which are not affected by unusual circumstances or one off events, were positive at $109.6 million. These were the highest underlying earnings for the group since before the GFC hit in financial year 2008. This was despite fuel cost increases and suggests, when we take one-off accounting charges out of the equation, that the Virgin business is performing well. In addition to improved underlying earnings, revenue was up 7.4% and is expected to have increased 6% in the 2019 financial year. This has been an ongoing theme for the company and suggests that when business conditions improve, the group will be ready to turn larger profits. While Virgin has not paid a dividend in recent memory, this is not necessarily a negative for new shareholders. It has inevitably contributed to the weaker share price and means that when the company is again ready to pay a dividend there will be an improvement to the share price. This will reward shareholders that purchase while the company goes through its current difficulties. Virgin trades on a price to book ratio of 1.31. Considering that the company could experience a turnaround in the coming years this is a low value. While the group has debt of around $2.57 million, it also has cash of $1.1 million, which, along with growing revenue, should be adequate to service the debt. While the Virgin share price has suffered","Jul 19, 2019",https://www.fool.com.au/2019/07/19/the-virgin-share-price-is-down-9-7-ytd-is-it-a-buy/

Domestic banks and financial institutions","The interim resolution professional (IRP) for Jet Airways has received claims worth Rs 24,887.93 crore against the grounded airline till July 4, according to the list of creditors uploaded on the company’s website.  Of these claims, the IRP has so far admitted claims worth Rs 8,462.78 crore and rejected claims of over Rs 1,380 crore. Claims worth over Rs 15,000 crore are pending verification. Domestic banks and financial institutions have claimed over Rs 6,441 crore, while foreign banks have claimed around Rs 1,569 crore.
Claims of workmen and employees stood at Rs 443.56 crore. Operational creditors, other than workmen and employees, have submitted claims worth Rs 12,373.59 crore. These claims are yet to be verified by the IRP. Claims continue to be verified and the list will be updated about once every three weeks, the document said. On June 20, the National Company Law Tribunal initiated corporate insolvency proceedings against the defunct airline following an application submitted by State Bank of India. The tribunal had asked that the process be fast-tracked as Jet Airways is a matter of “national importance”. The first fortnightly report was submitted to the tribunal on July 5 and the first meeting of the committee of creditors was held on July 16. The IRP is expected to invite expression of interest for the sale of the airline by July 20. The airline halted operations on April 17 after lenders refused to provide emergency funding.

6,Suzlon Energy: Another Jet Airways of the stock market in the making? | Zee Business,Suzlon Energy: Another Jet Airways of the stock market in the making?. Suzlon Energy share price is expected to witness," Suzlon Energy share price has tumbled around 11 per cent in this week and if we go by the stock market experts, the stock is expected to further nosedive as the counter is both technically and fundamentally weak. According to the stock market experts, the recent bond default to the tune of Rs 1300 crore has done further damage to the traders' sentiment. Since the company is facing a liquidity crisis there are murmurs that the counter may become another Jet Airways of the stock market. Both Jet Airways company and its shares have crash landed. After the free-fall of Jet Airways share price, SEBI had to withdraw Jet Airways shares from the cash segment to ensure the safety of the small investors. Advising stock market investors to avoid taking any position in the Suzlon Energy shares Prakash Pandey, Head of Research at Fairwealth Securities said, ""Fundamentally, Suzlon Energy shares are quite weak and its Saturday's bond default of Rs 1300 crore has further hit the stock market sentiments. The company is facing fund crisis and is going through one of the toughest phases of its existence."" He said that as in the case of Jet Airways, bankers are facing similar kind of solvency problem in regard to the Suzlon Energy. Prakash Pandey of Fairrwealth Securities advised share market investors is to avoid taking any position in Suzlon Energy stock. In fact, Pandey went one step ahead and advised share market investors to square-off their holding positions into Suzlon Energy counter.  See Zee Business video below:  Simi Bhaumik, a SEBI registered technical equity analyst told Zee Business online, ""Technically, Suzlon Energy share price is highly bearish and I advise market investors to avoid any buy call in regard to the Suzlon Energy shares and exit at current levels as it would further go southward in upcoming trade sessions."" Jet Airways share price came down from around Rs 275 per stock levels to Rs 42.70 (at 10:13 AM) in the last six months. The aviation counter witnessed a sharp decline in its price at Indian indices after the news breakout of its bankruptcy and series of delay in payments including salaries of its staffs.

What This Website Is About.","     SkyUp UnderAttack We are Join UP!, a tour operator, and SkyUp, an airline. We make travel affordable for a majority of Ukrainians. When someone wants to fly to Barcelona for 50 euros or to Lviv for 500 Ukrainian hryvnias, we are the ones to turn to.

Join UP! has been in business since 2010. SkyUp began operations in 2018, thus becoming the first Ukrainian low-cost airline. The two companies are part of a family business owned by Oleksandr Alba and his father, Yurii Alba.

We are a fast-growing business. SkyUp launched with 10 charter routes; today we already have 47 routes, 31 of which are regular. A year ago, SkyUp employed 17 people and had a fleet of 2 aircraft. Today we employ 488 people and have a fleet of 8 aircraft that is the youngest fleet in Ukraine. We have just recently completed its modernization, making our flights more environment-friendly and affordable. In the past year, we have carried 1,031,665 passengers. The past six months, our companies have been under attack. The main tools of pressure are of administrative nature: numerous inspections, lawsuits and inquiries sent in by Members of Parliament. Concurrently, there is also a smear campaign underway in the Ukrainian media. All of this became especially pronounced in the past two months. We see this as an attempt at a hostile takeover of our business, which we have already lived through back in 2013.

Despite unprecedented pressure, we are operating as normal and doing everything to make sure our passengers can reach one of the 47 destinations we offer, in comfort and without breaking the bank. In the sea of misinformation, we want you to know the facts of the case. How we got here and what’s at stake. We will present to you the main persons involved, the pertinent documents, and the timeline of events. Today is the day we are taking our last stand in order to defend ourselves and defend the right of Ukrainians to affordable traveling. We are guided by the principles of openness, rule of law, and fair competition.

Risk.,"      Andrew Walker | July 19, 2019 | More on: BMO BMO The Canadian banks are often cited as top picks for a balanced portfolio, but a wave of negative sentiment hit the sector late last year, and while most of the stocks have recovered, investors are wondering if the banks are still good bets. Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO)(NYSE:BMO) is often overlooked. It is Canada’s fourth-largest bank, so people usually focus on its three larger peers. Let’s take a look at the company to see if it might be an interesting pick right now. Bank of Montreal reported fiscal Q2 2019 adjusted net income of $1.5 billion, representing a 4% increase over the same period last year. The Canadian personal and commercial banking group performed well in a challenging environment with net income rising 5%, supported by solid loan growth and rising deposits in both sides of the operations. Bank of Montreal is known for being particularly strong in the commercial segment. Bank of Montreal’s capital markets group saw net income slip in the quarter compared to Q2 2018 primarily due to a jump in expenses connected to an acquisition. Wealth management net income increased 3% year over year in the quarter. Assets under management increased 6%. The U.S. operations are of particular interest. The bank’s personal and commercial banking segment south of the border saw adjusted net income rise 12% supported by solid loan and deposit growth. The company has had a strong U.S. presence since the 1980s, and the country now accounts for more than 30% of adjusted net income. This provides a nice hedge against downturn in Canada and gives investors good exposure to the U.S. through a Canadian stock. Bank of Montreal is Canada’s oldest bank and has the sector’s longest-running dividend. The company has given shareholders a piece of the profits every year since 1829, and that trend should continue. The board recently raised the quarterly dividend again, bumping it up $0.03 per share to $1.03. That’s a 7% gain in the past year. At the time of writing, the stock offers a yield of 4.2%. The current stock price of $99 puts the multiple at an attractive 10.5 times earnings. The stock still isn’t as cheap as it was in late December when it dipped below $87, but it should be a good value at this level.

The relations between the two promoter camps had gone sour recently over decision making and corporate governance issues. Gangwal has accused Bhatia of indulging in Related Party Transactions (RPT) in favour of InterGlobe Aviation Enterprise (owned by Bhatia). “Overhang of the battle will remain… As we are not aware about the details of the agreement between the two, risks of government intervention have increased and one of them is likely to take legal course,” says Gagan Dixit, Vice- President, institutional equities, Elara Capital. According to reports, Ministry of Corporate Affairs has asked IGE to respond to the allegations levelled by Gangwal. For tomorrow’s Board meeting, M Damodaran, the board chairman of IndiGo, has proposed to include at least two of the proposals made by Gangwal, according to a Business Standard report. The Board is likely to consider expansion of aircraft fleet along with changing board composition. While the chairman is expected to propose an expansion of the board to 12 members, the IGE group would get the right to appoint six directors and Rakesh Gangwal group two. Four of the directors will be designated independent, it said.

Every investor in International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (LON:IAG) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned. International Consolidated Airlines Group is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of UK£9.0b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it's seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about IAG. See our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. International Consolidated Airlines Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 36% of the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see International Consolidated Airlines Group's historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

16,The 737 MAX Fiasco Will Cost Boeing Over $8 Billion | The Motley Fool,"The 737 MAX Fiasco Will Cost Boeing Over $8 Billion. Between production inefficiencies, customer compensation, payments to victims' families, and","   As the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX has stretched from weeks to months, it has become clear that this safety crisis will prove costly for the aerospace giant. A few months ago, it seemed likely that the 737 MAX would return to service near the end of the summer. But due to additional safety problems uncovered during testing, a November or December return now seems more realistic -- and some observers think the grounding could extend into 2020. On Thursday afternoon, Boeing gave investors a first look at the expected costs of the 737 MAX grounding. The numbers it provided were eye-popping. Most notably, Boeing announced that it will record a $4.9 billion special charge in the second quarter -- $5.6 billion before tax. The company described that amount as ""an estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays."" Indeed, the extended grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX has been very costly for customers. In some cases, airlines have had to cancel flights due to fleet shortages. Others have resorted to pricey short-term aircraft leases or have been forced to keep flying older, fuel-guzzling aircraft that were scheduled for retirement in order to cover for grounded 737 MAX jets. American Airlines -- one major 737 MAX buyer -- has estimated that the grounding will hurt its 2019 pre-tax profit by hundreds of millions of dollars. Boeing noted that it will compensate customers in a variety of forms and over a period of many years, but not all at once. Many airlines are likely to get big discounts on future aircraft purchases in lieu of cash compensation, which will spread out the hit to Boeing's cash flow. BOEING WILL PROBABLY TRY TO COMPENSATE CUSTOMERS WITH DISCOUNTS ON FUTURE PURCHASES. IMAGE SOURCE: BOEING. In addition to the special charge, Boeing said that it increased its estimated costs to produce the current accounting quantity of 737 MAX jets by $1.7 billion during the second quarter. This reflects the inefficiencies from temporarily reducing the 737 production rate from 52 per month to 42 per month. (Boeing had initially planned to boost its 737 output to 57 per month this year.) That comes on top of a $1 billion increase to Boeing's estimated 737 MAX production costs that was announced several months ago.

17,US Airline CEOs Disappointed By Trump Meeting | One Mile at a Time,US Airline CEOs Disappointed By White House Meeting. Trump was angry that Bastian wasn’t there. US airline CEOs were surprised,"Travel in the Time of COVID: The news, resources, & information you need Yesterday I wrote about how President Trump had a meeting with several airline CEOs, including those from American Airlines, United Airlines, and even Qatar Airways. One of the topics of conversation was subsidies for Gulf carriers, which the US airlines just go on and on about. This was a closed meeting, so unfortunately we don’t officially know that much about what happened, if it was catered by McDonald’s, etc. However, there are now some reports of how the conversation went, and it sounds like it may not have gone as planned for US airlines. Delta’s CEO, Ed Bastian, couldn’t attend the meeting. That’s a bit surprising, given that he’s the most vocal about the Gulf carriers, so you’d think he would have done absolutely everything in his power to be there. A Delta spokesperson claims he wasn’t there due to travel that he wasn’t able to reschedule: “Ed unfortunately had some previously scheduled travel that he was unable to reschedule. He is appreciative of opportunities … to discuss this important issue with the president and members of the administration. Delta remains 100% committed to leveling the playing field in international aviation.” But that’s not how it was perceived. A senior White House official said: “The real story is that Delta refused the invite. That didn’t help their cause.” Apparently Trump brought up several times during the meeting how Delta’s CEO wasn’t there, and Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker also pointed out how he flew all the way from Qatar to be there, while Bastian couldn’t even make the trip.  Sources suggest that the US airline executives in attendance were “shocked” when they found out that Al Baker was invited to the meeting, given the topic they were hoping to discuss. It’s also reported that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro wasn’t happy about Al Baker being there. A White House official had the following to say: “The president expressly wanted the Qatar CEO as he wanted a variety of perspectives, as he always does.”  The resolution from the meeting? Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad have to stop service to the US effective immediately, and have to pay US carriers $50 billion for the illegal subsidies they’ve received over the past decade. Just kidding, of course. President Trump told US carriers to just go through","Jul 20, 2019",https://onemileatatime.com/airline-ceos-white-house/

There are all kinds of indicators and metrics in the stock market that assist traders and investors. One type of indicator in the stock market is known as the “contrarian signal”. This is a market indicator which indicates the opposite of what one might intuitively conclude from the signal itself. One such stock market indicator is the “dumb money confidence index”. For better or for worse, it is generally regarded that institutional and hedge fund investors are smarter than individual retail investors. Consequently, individual retail investors are known as “dumb money”. The theory behind confidence indicators is that if everyone is bullish and/or confident, then all of the people who could be buying securities in the stock market are already in the market. That suggests that the market is closer to a top. The reverse is also true. If everyone is bearish and/or not confident, then all of the people who could be selling securities in the stock market have already sold out of the market. That suggests that the market is closer to a bottom. The chart below is a contrarian indicator. A regular survey of the stock market’s smart money currently shows that only 31% are confident in the state of the stock market, while the dumb money has 79% confidence. This can be interpreted to mean that the dumb money, or the retail investor, doesn’t realize that the stock market is close to a top.
