3,American Airlines Is Betting on the Airbus A321XLR | The Motley Fool,"American Airlines Is Betting on the Airbus A321XLR. Last week, the world's largest airline became the largest customer for Airbus'","   As expected, Airbus (OTC:EADSY) launched the longest-range variant of its popular A321neo jet -- the A321XLR -- at last week's Paris Air Show. With a stated range of 4,700 nautical miles, the A321XLR will have by far the most range in its size class, allowing airlines to open up new long-haul routes that don't have enough demand to support wide-body service. The A321XLR has already attracted substantial interest from airlines. During the air show, Airbus won 48 firm orders and 79 commitments for the new model, and customers converted another 99 firm orders from other models to the A321XLR. No. 1 global airline American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) made the biggest commitment to the new jet model, agreeing to take 50. Let's take a look at why American Airlines is so bullish on the A321XLR. Like the other two big U.S. network carriers, American Airlines currently uses Boeing 757-200s for ""long-and-thin"" routes between the East Coast and Europe, as well as on certain routes to South America. However, the 757 has been out of production for 15 years. The 34 Boeing 757s that American still operates are nearly 20 years old on average. American Airlines plans to replace 10 of its remaining 757s later this year, but there is no good substitute currently available for the other 24, which serve longer routes. The A321XLR is perfect, though, offering more range and 30% lower fuel burn per seat. AMERICAN AIRLINES WILL ADD 50 A321XLRS TO ITS FLEET BETWEEN 2023 AND 2025. IMAGE SOURCE: AIRBUS. As a result, American has decided to convert 30 of its existing Airbus A321neo orders to the A321XLR variant. The first eight will arrive in 2023 -- the first year of availability -- with the remaining 22 coming in 2024. That will be perfect timing for replacing American Airlines' last 24 757s. However, American Airlines' management sees the Airbus A321XLR as more than just a replacement for the carrier's current 757s. The airline exercised 20 of its A321neo options to order additional A321XLRs that will arrive in 2025, bringing its A321XLR fleet to a total of 50 aircraft. Given that American Airlines plans to take roughly twice as many A321XLRs as it would need to replace the 24 757s that will remain in its fleet after this year, the airline clearly expects this aircraft to open up new growth opportunities. The A321XLR could be particularly useful","Jun 24, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/24/american-airlines-is-betting-on-the-airbus-a321xlr.aspx

ntense competition in the European budget airline sector is keeping fares low – great news for passengers, but not so much for shareholders of EasyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air. On Sunday 16 June, Lufthansa [LHA] cut its full-year profit forecast, sending its share price down by 9.5% overnight to €16 when the market opened the next day. Europe’s largest airline group, which operates budget brand Eurowings, blamed “market-wide overcapacities and aggressively growing low-cost competitors”. By the end of the week, the airline’s share price hit a year-to-date low of €14.81, representing a 25% decline since the start of this year. Lufthansa’s news sent airline stocks tumbling, with the Stoxx Europe Total Market Airlines [T5751] sector index down 5.25% by close on Monday 17 June before hitting a two-year low of €280 on Wednesday. Looking at individual competitors, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair [RYA] saw its share price hit a year-to-date low of €9.86 on Thursday, while Easyjet [EZJ] and Wizz Air’s [WIZZ] share prices fell by 4.9% and 4.7% respectively throughout the week.

In May, Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary spoke of an “attritional fare war” that will engulf the market for the next year or two. In January, the Irish airline was forced to lower full-year earnings forecasts by €100m to between €1bn and €1.1bn – its second profit warning in four months. Rival EasyJet has so far stuck to guidance for 2019 but warned of “softness” for H2.

8,Warren Buffett on His 10% Rule - GuruFocus.com,. . . . . . . . . . Warren Buffett on His 10% Rule. The guru explains why,"After several decades of trying to avoid the airline sector altogether, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has changed his mind over the past several years and now really likes it. There's one airline he loves more than most, and that's Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE:DAL).   Airline buying Buffett likes Delta so much that he recently crossed the 10% threshold in the company's stock. At the beginning of the year, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) increased its stake in the airline to more than 10%, the level at which it has to start reporting movements in its position to the market daily.  When he was asked why he decided to cross the 10% threshold during an interview with CNBC a few weeks later, Buffett responded: ""What I didn't realize was that that purchase had taken us over 10%. I was already in territory I didn't plan to get, so I just decided to buy a whole lot more stock."" The Oracle of Omaha said it was a mistake that he went over the self-imposed 10% barrier, but I think it's unlikely this was a genuine blunder. Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time and is well known for his skill with facts and figures. I think it's highly unlikely he didn't know where the 10% marker was. If it was a genuine mistake, it must be the first time in his career that Buffett has gotten the numbers wrong. Going over 10% Speculation aside, it's interesting to know the reasons why Buffett does not want to go over this 10% threshold when buying stocks. He was asked about this at the 2019 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting of shareholders. On some occasions, primarily with financial companies, Berkshire is not allowed to go over the 10% boundary due to restrictions put in place by the Federal Reserve, though the Fed is gearing up to relax these rules, potentially allowing investors to own up to 25% of a bank without triggering more restrictive rules and oversight. But there's another critical reason why Buffett does not like to go over this boundary, as he explained at the meeting: ""Many people probably don't even...know about this, but if you own over 10% of a security...and you sell it within six months at a profit, you give the money over to the company, the short-swing profit that you give them and match...any sale","Jun 24, 2019",https://www.gurufocus.com/news/898907/warren-buffett-on-his-10-rule
9,Aviation sector: Turbulence in wake of Jet Airways closure - The Financial Express,Aviation sector: Turbulence in wake of Jet Airways closure. The capacity deficit caused by the event will take time to,"The suspension of operations by Jet Airways, the country’s second-largest domestic airline, cast a shadow on the aviation sector’s performance in the last fiscal, with passenger traffic growth falling to a five-year low of 11.6% y-o-y in FY19. Passenger traffic had grown by 12.5-16.5% y-o-y in the 2014-18 period. Full-service carrier Jet, which had 119 aircraft in its fleet in December, 2018, suspended all operations on April 17 owing to a financial crisis. This has had a ripple effect on passenger footfall and shipment of cargo at airports—domestic air traffic fell by 4.5% y-o-y in April, breaking a growth streak of over 55 months. The top two airports—in Delhi and Mumbai—are the hardest hit by Jet’s closure as the airline had sizeable capacity deployed on tier-I routes. The two airports handle more than one-third of the total footfall at airports—of the 344.6 m passengers that used India’s 102 airports in FY19, over 118 m flew through the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi and the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai in FY19.  While passenger traffic at the Delhi airport declined by 3% y-o-y in February, the Mumbai airport, the hub of Jet’s operations, has been reporting de-growth in passenger footfall since October last year. Traffic at airports in Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata has also been impacted. Apart from the Metro routes, Jet had won rights to operate on regional routes under the UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) scheme, for which the Airports Authority of India has been developing airports across the country. The void created by Jet’s exit can be gauged from the fact that the carrier flew more than 50,000 passengers every day during calendar year 2018, operating 650 flights daily. It was also the largest Indian carrier flying international routes. According to ratings agency ICRA, Jet’s grounding has brought down industry capacity by 14%. Analysing the impact of Jet’s shutdown, Kinjal Shah, the agency’s vice-president and co-head, Corporate Sector Ratings, says, “overall, the moderation in capacity starting February, 2019 has resulted in higher air fares—a 30-40% increase between September, 2018 and March, 2019 – and inconvenience to passengers. India being a highly price-sensitive market, it has also affected passenger traffic growth from October, 2018 onwards.” Jet’s rival airlines are understandably not complaining about the void its exit has created, grabbing the flying slots it once held and deploying its unused aircraft to take advantage of","Jun 24, 2019",https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/airlines-aviation/aviation-sector-turbulence-in-wake-of-jet-airways-closure/1616546/
10,"How Indigo, SpiceJet, GoAir benefitted from Jet Airways shutdown; latest data reveals all | Zee Business","How Indigo, SpiceJet, GoAir benefitted from Jet Airways shutdown; latest data reveals all. At present, the market share of Indigo"," The latest May 2019 domestic passenger data shows that, private carriers SpiceJet, Indigo and GoAir have benefited from the shutdown of Jet Airways operations. In May month, the domestic PAX rose by 3%, while market leader  IndiGo grew 23.2%, whereas SpiceJet (SJet) grew 23.6% and Go Air (GO) grew 31%. Interestingly, Ansuman Deb, Research Analyst at ICICI Securities said, “The impact would be even higher in the international segment.” According to Deb,  IndiGo would have higher total growth considering the several new routes it had launched in the international segment. Aggregate passenger load factor (PLF) improved significantly, with IndiGo, SJet and GO reporting 90.9%, 93.3% and 93.9% PLF, respectively, during May.  At present, the market share of Indigo stands at ~49%; while SpiceJet and Go Air witnessed market share increase to ~14.8%/ 11.1%, respectively.  “Jet market share redistribution to best benefit IndiGo and SJet,” said Deb.  What can we expect ahead?  Now that first quarter of FY20 is right around the corner, Deb says, “The effect of Jet shut down amidst seasonal strong demand should lead to strong earnings growth for IndiGo (combined effect of 30% capacity growth and 5% organic yield growth and additional systemic fare growth). The fare growth of Q4FY17 was 17% for IndiGo. With April and May being better than March, the fare momentum is expected to continue. SJet had limited window to sell the capacity received through Jet planes which should lead to limited fare growth.” While overall FY20 outlook is still in favor of Jet Airways rivals, but the challenge would be in airfares which has spiked since past few months.  In Deb’s view,  lower traffic growth in May is largely on account of lower capacity as Jet was finally grounded by the end of the month. Additionally, full ramp-up of sales of Jet tickets, which moved to SJet fleet, would take some time. Also, there would be significant increase in passenger growth of SJet in coming months driven by proper utilisation of the airplanes inducted from Jet. The big jump in capacity and traffic would happen in Q2FY20. However, considering it is a weak season, the fare growth might be a challenge.  Overall, Deb highlighted, there could be only 7% and 14% aggregate domestic capacity growth for FY20 and FY21, respectively, for Indian airlines measured in terms of Available Seat Kilometers (ASK).

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value? One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks: PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole. On this front, JetBlue Airways has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.65, as you can see in the chart below:   This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 18.28. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, JetBlue Airways’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years.   Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Transportation sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.74. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.    We should also point out that JetBlue Airways has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.74, so it is fair to","Jun 24, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jetblue-airways-jblu-great-pick-133501010.html
13,How High Can Aurora Cannabis (TSX:ACB) Stock Go? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . How High Can Aurora Cannabis (TSX:ACB) Stock Go?. Foolish bottom line. Two,"      Jason Phillips | June 23, 2019 | More on: ACB ACB Aurora Cannabis (TSX:ACB)(NYSE:ACB) shares are currently trading at a rather lofty 500 times price-to-earnings multiple. But are fears that Canada’s second-largest publicly traded cannabis stock is overvalued overblown? Let’s take a closer look at why ACB’s current price-to-earnings multiple might not have  much to do with the company’s potential as an attractive long-term growth prospect. Aurora’s market capitalization right now sits at about $10 billion, which means that at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 500 times the market is currently expecting the company to earn somewhere in the neighbourhood of $200 million next year ($10 billion divided by 500). Going back to its most recently reported third quarter for a second, Aurora produced just 15,590 kilograms of cannabis, generating a loss of $158 million in the process. Those production levels were actually a 99% increase compared to the 7,822 kilograms it had produced in the prior quarter, so it’s clearly making improvement, but then again, there’s also a long way for it to go. Because despite producing a little more than 15,000 kg over the past quarter, its production capacity right now sits at 150,000 kilograms annually. Longer term, it’s expecting that figure to reach 625,000 kilograms annually by as early as December 31, 2020. Obviously, there will be a lot riding on its ability to execute the build-out of its planned production facilities and ramping up those operations in an orderly (and profitable) manner. If it can do that, I think the future could be very bright for the company and its loyal shareholders. Call me crazy, but I believe that even despite the loss it posted in during the third quarter, in the grand scheme of things, this company, and particularly in light of the massive scale of its operations, should eventually be able to grow, cultivate, and sell its cannabis product at a profit. What that profit will be, the truth is, no one really knows for sure, because we’re still far too early in the game to be able to tell. But I’d like to believe that a 10% or even 15% or 20% net profit margin would be reasonable for a company that at least so far is fairly well protected by a government in charge of granting licenses to approved growers.

GoAir said that it is pleased to offer a reliable travel,"Fliers in India and tourists and travellers from abroad to the country often seek opinions on which airline to trust. Before booking flight tickets, fliers look into key aspects such as quality of services offered by that airline and ticket fares. On-Time-Performance (OTP) is considered as pivotal for any airline when it comes to attracting fliers by assuring punctuality and convenience. GoAir has recorded the best OTP for the ninth consecutive month. GoAir recorded 91.8 per cent OTP and had the lowest cancellation rate of 0.33 per cent. Rankings were released by Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for May 2019. GoAir said that it is pleased to offer a reliable travel service wherein travellers get to their destination in a timely manner. GoAir added that factors that are not necessarily in its control like airport congestion, taxi times from the runways, gate availability etc., they have tried to provide best services. Besides, the DGCA report also stated that GoAir had the second highest load factor of 93.3 % indicating the number of seats filled, the company said in a statement. “GoAir is India’s fastest growing airline and we will continue to step up our performance and invest in Operational Excellence across the board. We thank our customers as this milestone would not have been possible without their punctuality, loyalty and support of millions of guests who have flown with us,” a spokesperson said. What is On-Time-Performance (OTP)? On-Time Performance is a comparison between the actual off-block time of an aircraft of an airline against the schedule time for that particular departing flight. This internationally accepted standard practice and comply with standard benchmark set by IATA (International Airlines Transport Association). OTP ranking assumes critical importance in today’s context when passengers are looking at reliability and trust. From various research studies it is evident that achieving better customer satisfaction is about more than airfare and flight availability. When considering an airline, travelers look for timeliness and assurance and on-time arrival is one of the major factors. GoAir operates over 270 daily flights and carried around 13 lakh passengers in the month of May 2019. GoAir flies to 24 domestic destinations including Ahmedabad, Bagdogra, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Goa, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jammu, Kochi, Kolkata, Kannur, Leh, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Patna, Port Blair, Pune, Ranchi and Srinagar, and 4 international destinations, including Phuket, Malé, Muscat and Abu Dhabi.

Such companies offer the greatest potential for strong long-term investment returns. However, acquiring these companies at a reasonable price is also a critical part of implementing this strategy. If too much is paid for the shares, strong return potential is diminished.

Over the last few years, many recently-launched companies have received a great deal of media attention due to their very high growth potential. They are typically touted as the next big thing (Beyond Meat, Uber, Lyft, Shopify and Canopy Growth among others).In many cases these companies are without profits and in some, there’s no plan yet in place to achieve profitability. Investors are left with the task of estimating what rapid and pronounced future sales growth might mean to future profitability. These companies may indeed have strong sales growth and some appear to be creating entirely new industries that are disrupting current ones, but do the stock prices justify the valuations the market is placing on them?

Growth stocks have beaten value stocks over the last decade, particularly in the last five years (78 per cent total return for the S&P 500 Growth Index versus 38 per cent for the Value Index since May 2014), but consequently, many growth stocks have become fully valued. Finding reasonably-valued growth stocks has become more challenging than it was a few years ago. Our strategy to deal with this changing market environment, however, is not to abandon growth stocks as we still believe over the long term these are the best companies to own. We plan to stay vigilant, continue to turn over stones in search of new opportunities and await chances to acquire higher-profile, expensive rapid growers upon a sizeable market correction as we did with Amazon in the fourth quarter (up 42 per cent since Dec. 24).

LISTEN TO THE PODCAST. RECENT POSTS.,"AFTER DINNER INVESTOR ON THE HUNT FOR NO-BRAINERS | VALUE INVESTING PODCAST AND NEWS JUNE 24, 2019 BY AFTER DINNER INVESTOR Yes! Another eureka moment! Whenever I watch a Mohnish Pabrai, Warren Buffett, or Charlie Munger interview or lecture, there’s always a eureka moment where I’m shouting for joy because anther investing lesson has been learned.  Sometimes these guys say something with such clarity that it makes me shout for joy.  And this weekend while I was walking and taking in Mohnish’s new question and answer session with the London Business School, I had one of these eureka moments. Something I’ve been struggling with for months now is finding time for extensive stock research, general reading, and running my business.  I just haven’t had time for all three.  So I’ve focused on running my business of course, as that’s the golden goose that lays the eggs, and I’ve also spent a lot of fruitless time hunting for no-brainer stock investments.  But my general reading time has fallen off, and that’s upset me, as I really want to do a ton of general reading everyday. My eureka moment came during this video when I heard Mohnish talk about how he sifts through stock ideas and how his objective is to reject stock ideas as quickly as possible.  I have the embedded video below set to this specific question around the 16 minute mark.  Let’s take in Mohnish’s discussion of rejecting stock ideas and then we’ll continue this article.  Mohnish says that his objective is to as quickly as possible reject the idea so he can get back to general reading.  He says that the model is not to find investments, rather, the model is to find the flimsiest reason to say “no.”  And as soon as you get to the first reason to say no, you move on. And he says that there are two things that help you get rid of stock ideas very quickly, circle of competence and valuation. Mohnish says that this two item checklist takes as little as 60 seconds. First, determine whether or not the business is within your circle of competence.  Over the last year, flipping through Value Line, I’ve probably wasted one to two hours of my life looking at pharmaceutical companies’ cash levels, wondering if they were selling for less than net","Jun 24, 2019",https://afterdinnerinvestor.com/mohnish-pabrai-rejects-stock-ideas-as-quickly-as-possible/

The cash-strapped company became the first domestic airliner to go into bankruptcy after the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted an insolvency petition filed by SBI on behalf of 26 lenders on June 20. ""Pursuant to an order dated June 20, 2019 of NCLT Mumbai Bench, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) has been initiated for Jet Airways (India) as per the provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016,"" Jet Airways said in a regulatory filing Sunday.

The NCLT bench comprising VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy set a 90-day deadline to resolution professional Ashish Chhauchharia of Grant Thornton to conclude the resolution process, even though the bankruptcy law allows 180 days for the same, saying ""the matter is of national importance.""

The bench also instructed the resolution professional to file fortnightly progress report and submit the first such report on July 5 when it will begin to hear the matter again.

Regulations, Standards and","If you wish to contribute or participate in the discussions about articles you are invited to join SKYbrary as a registered user This Article provides general information about the safe transportation of live animals by air. For more detailed information and guidance on this subject, refer to the links provided throughout and at the end of this Article. There are many reasons why people wish to transport live animals. The animals may be personal pets, or guide and assistance dogs. They may be sporting animals, agricultural animals for breeding, food animals being transported for slaughter, zoological animals and species being transported for reasons of science. Transporting animals for long periods of time is considered unnecessarily cruel and to be avoided whenever possible. Therefore, for long journeys the only speedy option is to use aircraft. Because air transport is the most humane way of transporting live animals on long journeys, it is important to ensure high standards are maintained by all those involved: veterinary inspectors, animal keepers, handlers and attendants, container manufacturers, air carriers, pilots etc. This is best achieved through regulation and oversight. Regulations for the transport of live animals need to set a balance between ensuring compliance with aviation safety requirements and practice, and treating animals humanely in accordance with current welfare standards. The safety of crewmembers, passengers and animal handlers also need to be considered. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is not a regulatory body, but airline members of the Association are obliged to ensure IATA’s Live Animals Regulations (LAR) are followed. As such, IATA’s LAR has become the worldwide standard for transporting live animals by commercial airlines, and supranational and national regulating bodies reference it. As well as providing guidance for airlines, the LAR is used by shippers, freight forwarders, and animal care professionals. The LAR contains a comprehensive classification of 1000’s of animal species along with the container specifications required for their transport. It also includes information on handling, marking & labelling along with necessary documentation when transporting animals by air. International and national regulations will also apply. It may not always be the case that compliance with the LAR will meet these requirements and air carriers will need to ensure that all regulations are followed. For example, the Australian National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare (NCCAW) (Position Statement - October 1993, revised 2007) considers the LAR as minimum standards only and not fully satisfactory","Jun 23, 2019",https://aviationsafetywiki.org/index.php/Transporting_Live_Animals_By_Air

As an investor, the facet which stands out is his ability to pick the winners on the regular basis. To understand this let's take a look at the thing which makes Buffett great- his iconic investments, and his investment philosophy.    Warren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930 to his father Howard, a stockbroker-turned-Congressman. The only boy, he was the second of three children and displayed an amazing aptitude for both money and business at a very early age. Acquaintances recount his uncanny ability to calculate columns of numbers off the top of his head - a feat Warren still amazes business colleagues with today. At only six years old, Buffett purchased 6-packs of Coca Cola from his grandfather's grocery store for twenty five cents and resold each of the bottles for a nickel, pocketing a five cent profit. While other children his age were playing hopscotch and jacks, Warren was making money. Five years later, Buffett took his step into the world of high finance. At eleven years old, he purchased three shares of Cities Service Preferred at $38 per share for both himself and his older sister, Doris. Shortly after buying the stock, it fell to just over $27 per share. A frightened but resilient Warren held his shares until they rebounded to $40.
