1,10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential in 2019 | InvestorPlace,10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential. These 10 undervalued stocks are positioned to make big moves higher. Foot Locker (FL).," Source: Shutterstock The stock market has rushed to all-time highs in 2019 and — despite recent trade-inspired turbulence — is still on pace to have one of its best years in recent memory. But not all stocks have joined in on the rally. Instead, a handful of stocks have actually had a rough 2019, dropping big year-to-date into historically undervalued territory — even while the market trades at a decade-high valuation. Some of these undervalued stocks are undervalued for a reason, and should be avoided for the foreseeable future. The fundamentals simply don’t warrant a turnaround. But some of these undervalued stocks look primed for a breakout. That is, some of them appear unreasonably undervalued, with big catalysts on the horizon — a combination which paves a tangible pathway for big upside. With that in mind, let’s take a look at 10 undervalued stocks with breakout potential in the back-half of 2019. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  The Valuation: Because the athletic apparel sector sources a lot of production from China, many athletic apparel stocks find themselves at the epicenter of the U.S.-China trade war. Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) is no exception. The company’s margins have come under significant pressure thanks to tariffs, and in response, investors have sold off FL stock to an anemic 8-times forward earnings multiple, versus a five-year-average forward multiple north of 12, a consumer discretionary sector average multiple north of 20, and a footwear sector average multiple north of 28. The Breakout Catalyst: Foot Locker’s demand trends are healthy. Last quarter, Foot Locker reported nearly 5% comparable sales growth. Thus, the whole problem here is the trade war. If the trade war cools, FL stock will presumably rally in a big way. It increasingly appears that this will happen. U.S. President Donald Trump has delayed the next round of tariffs, while China is coming under intense internal pressure with the Hong Kong riots. Consequently, it appears both sides want to de-escalate trade tensions. Such a de-escalation should couple with strong demand drivers at Foot Locker to propel a breakout rally in FL stock into the end of 2019.

2,Southwest Airlines Will Resume Hawaii Expansion in 2020 | The Motley Fool,Southwest Airlines Will Resume Hawaii Expansion in 2020. The low-fare carrier will launch several new mainland-Hawaii routes and interisland routes,"   For the past five months, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has had to keep its Hawaii growth plans on ice, because of the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX. The 737 MAX was supposed to account for nearly 10% of Southwest's fleet by the end of 2019. Without those planes, there was no way for the carrier to expand in Hawaii without making deep cuts elsewhere. However, in conjunction with its second-quarter earnings report, Southwest Airlines announced that it would soon resume its growth in Hawaii. On Thursday, the low-fare airline revealed its next batch of routes to and within Hawaii -- and they will start up early next year. Southwest Airlines launched the first of its long-awaited flights to Hawaii back in March. By late May, the carrier was operating six daily round trips between the mainland and Hawaii -- connecting Oakland and San Jose to Honolulu and Kahului -- as well as 16 daily interisland flights within Hawaii: four Honolulu-Kahului roundtrips and four Honolulu-Kona round trips. Unfortunately, the Boeing 737 MAX grounding began soon after Southwest Airlines announced its first batch of Hawaii routes, and it has dragged on far longer than expected. Indeed, the airline said last month that it had removed the 737 MAX from its schedules until January 2020. THE 737 MAX GROUNDING DISRUPTED SOUTHWEST'S PLAN FOR EXPANDING IN HAWAII. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. However, Southwest Airlines recently decided to end all service to Newark Airport. That move freed up airplanes to support additional Hawaii routes -- even if the 737 MAX's return is delayed again. First, Southwest announced its first route connecting Sacramento to Hawaii: a daily nonstop to Honolulu. Second, the carrier announced its first routes from the mainland to Kona and Lihue. From Oakland, it will fly four days a week to Kona and three days a week to Lihue; from San Jose, it will fly three days a week to Kona and four days a week to Lihue. Third, Southwest revealed three new interisland routes. It will offer four daily round trips from Honolulu to Lihue, four daily round trips from Honolulu to Kona, and one daily round trip between Kahului and Kona. With these moves, Lihue and Hilo will become the next new cities in Southwest Airlines' route network. All of these new routes will start up in early 2020, between Jan. 19 and Jan. 21.

Discover Thomson Reuters More By Donny Kwok, Jamie Freed 4 MIN READ HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Ltd 0293.HK needs to focus on safety and security, its customers and the completion of a three-year financial turnaround plan, the airline's new chief executive told staff on Monday. Augustus Tang took the top job at the airline following the sudden exit of Rupert Hogg on Friday amid mounting Chinese scrutiny over the involvement of some of the Hong Kong carrier’s staff in anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hogg’s departure highlights growing pressure on the corporate sector in the Chinese-controlled former British colony, where Beijing is trying to quell protests that have gone on for 11 straight weeks. Tang, a former Cathay executive who had been running an aircraft engineering business for parent Swire Pacific Ltd 0019.HK, was appointed as the airline attempts to salvage relations with Beijing. The Chinese regulator had demanded it suspend staff supporting anti-government protests. Tang told staff the airline’s safety management system required 100% compliance with all rules issued by regulators. “Right now, we are one of the most watched companies in the world,” he said in an email to staff which was seen by Reuters. “As such, more than ever, each one of us carries a personal responsibility to make sure that our reputation for safety and security is untarnished.” Tang also said a three-year financial turnaround plan begun by Hogg would continue at full speed. “We cannot ease off the throttle, especially at a time when international trade tensions are high and international travel is under pressure,” he said. Cathay shares had a choppy day on Monday, rising more than 2% early on but later falling by nearly as much. They closed 1% higher. Earlier this month, Cathay swung to its first profit for the January-June period since 2016 on the back of the transformation plan and forecast it would have higher earnings in the seasonally better second half. Analysts said Tang’s priority should be on rebuilding the brand and restoring customer confidence in all markets, including Hong Kong, the mainland and overseas after the Chinese regulatory action and recent disruptions","Aug 19, 2019",https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-cathay-pacific-stocks/cathay-pacifics-new-boss-puts-emphasis-on-safety-and-security-idUKKCN1V903Q

By: Francois Aure | Email | Leave a comment By CCN.com: In response to the struggling stock market, Donald Trump’s Twitter feed was awash with positive talk about the trade war and progress with China on Sunday. A more upbeat Trump could be precisely what the doctor ordered for bruised markets, putting the wind at the S&P 500’s back next week. U.S. stock futures opened higher Sunday evening, suggesting a bright open on Monday morning in New York. We are doing very well with China, and talking! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2019  It has been all concessions from the U.S. administration since markets took a deep dive on Wednesday. The delaying of tariffs combined with these latest tweets could certainly help spark some buying in a stock market that has proven impressively resilient over the last few days.

By: Joseph Young | Email | Leave a comment By CCN.com: Following the U.S. stock market’s wildest week of the year, the Dow Jones and other major indices appear poised to start the week off with a bang. But just days removed from the Dow’s worst loss of 2019, why has Wall Street suddenly turned bullish? Three words: central bank policy. While the sentiment around a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China remains gloomy, investors expect central banks to be on alert after the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield plunged below 2 percent. In recent weeks, billions of dollars have rushed into government bonds to safeguard investor holdings against more potential downside movement amidst intensifying geopolitical risks. On Sunday, President Trump said that he’s in no rush to strike a trade deal with China. Americans, he said, are “rich”: “We’re doing tremendously well, our consumers are rich, I gave a tremendous tax cut, and they’re loaded up with money.”   President Trump stressed that he is “not ready” to make a deal with China, noting that Hong Kong could benefit the trade deal if the tension can be relieved in a humanitarian fashion. “I would like to see Hong Kong worked out in a very humanitarian fashion. I think it would be very good for the trade deal.” With a U.S.-China trade deal becoming less likely in the short term and investors pouring into government bonds, equities bulls believe that central bank stimuli are inevitable to prevent the global economy from","Aug 19, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/why-stock-market-turned-bullish/
6,Southwest Stock Gains after Wolfe Research’s Upgrade,Southwest Stock Gains after Wolfe Research’s Upgrade. What could drive Southwest stock higher?. Southwest’s peers. Stock performance,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Southwest Airlines (LUV) stock gained 3.3% last Friday after a prominent Wall Street analyst upgraded his rating on the stock. On August 16, Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay raised his rating on the stock to “outperform” from “peer perform.” CNBC revealed Keay’s views during its Halftime Report traders’ debate show last Friday. The analyst upgraded his rating “on a flight to quality concept.” He pointed out that Southwest has a strong brand affinity and that its cost trends are moving in the right direction. Southwest Airlines is the world’s largest low-cost carrier. US airlines have reported strong corporate and leisure passenger demand since the beginning of 2019, mainly in the domestic market. The primary drivers of air-passenger traffic in the US market are a strong job market and a steady rise in wages. So, we believe that Southwest Airlines’ low-cost services could help it capitalize on the growing opportunities in the domestic market. Presently, Keay has a $57 target price on Southwest Airlines, signifying a 14.5% upside potential from its August 16 closing price of $49.79. Wolfe’s target price is slightly lower than the consensus target price of $59.35 set by analysts polled by Reuters. The consensus price target suggests a potential rise of 19% over the next year. Further, analysts polled by Reuters have a consensus “hold” rating on the stock. About 35% of the analysts covering the stock have a bullish recommendation. Nearly 55% of these analysts recommend a “hold,” and the remaining 10% have a bearish stance. In our view, the return of Boeing’s (BA) 737 MAX planes could be a key driver for Southwest stock moving higher this year. Notably, 737 MAX jets have faced a worldwide flying ban since mid-March following two deadly accidents within five months. The global flying ban led to massive flight cancellations over the last five months, disrupting the airline’s business operations. Southwest owns 34 MAX jets. During its second-quarter earnings results, Southwest Airlines disclosed that the MAX grounding led to over 20,000 flight cancellations. As a result, its year-over-year revenue growth rate slowed in Q2 to 2.9% from the mid-to-high single-digit increase it had recorded in the preceding three quarters. However, we believe that Southwest’s strong passenger traffic more than offset the negative effect of the 737 MAX grounding. The airline’s passenger yield increased 4.2% in the second quarter, while its load factor improved by 1.7%","Aug 19, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/08/southwest-stock-gains-after-wolfe-research-upgrade/

10,Could This Be the Final Chapter for Indigo Books & Music (TSX:IDG)? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Could This Be the Final Chapter for Indigo Books & Music (TSX:IDG)?.,"      Joey Frenette | August 18, 2019 | More on: AMZN IDG Indigo Books & Music (TSX:IDG) can’t seem to catch a break of late. The book retailer that survived the initial onslaught from Amazon.com is now in a world of pain with its shares now down over 66% from its high. It was never supposed to be this way. What happened? The company recently pulled the curtain on some pretty underwhelming Q1 2020 results, sending the stock down 15% on Wednesday, a forgettable day for the bulls. Indigo reported an adjusted loss of $0.69 per share, exceeding the loss expectations of $0.46, making this the fourth straight time that Indigo has fallen short of analyst expectations. The larger-than-expected net loss came in at $19.1 million and was due to falling sales and higher restructuring costs amidst the company’s initiatives to cut down on costs. Revenues also fell short of expectations at $192.6 million, down nearly $13 million year over year, and missing the consensus estimate of $237.1 million. The drastic fall in sales was thanks in part to a reduction in promos to increase profitability numbers. Unfortunately, it appears as though Indigo had cut a bit too deep this time around as the company missed on both the top and bottom line by a country mile, although Q4 2019 was a far bigger strikeout. When will the pain stop for the struggling book, gift, and toy retailer? After Indigo’s recent drop, the stock looks technically broken and could stand to injure investors with the guts to try to catch the falling knife. The next stop could be $5 and change, especially if the Canadian economy remains sluggish. Physical books are a want, not a need, and with readily-available eBooks that can be borrowed from your local library through an app like Libby, many consumers are holding off on buying the latest bestseller from their local Indigo or Chapters. Gifts and toys provide Indigo with a more recession-resilient stream of cash flows, especially if the company were to double-down on the kids and babies markets, as fellow Fool Will Ashworth pointed out in his prior piece. Ambrose O’Callaghan seems to think that Indigo can give Amazon a taste of its own medicine with the growth potential behind its e-commerce platform. While the platform does show tremendous promise, brick-and-mortar will be where Indigo’s real strength will","Aug 18, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/08/18/could-this-be-the-final-chapter-for-indigo-books-music-tsxidg/

USD/JPY.,"                                                   It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. That downside risk was realized by Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 33%. That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 1.9%. The silver lining (for longer term investors) is that the stock is still 9.1% higher than it was three years ago. There was little comfort for shareholders in the last week as the price declined a further 5.2%. See our latest analysis for Textron In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Textron share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 183%. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped. It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too. Given the yield is quite low, at 0.2%, we doubt the dividend can shed much light on the share price. On the other hand, we're certainly perturbed by the 8.5% decline in Textron's revenue. Many investors see falling revenue as a likely precursor to lower earnings, so this could well explain the weak share price.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Andy Bounds Who would want to sell package holidays these days? Tour operators Thomas Cook and Tui are losing money. Customers are nervous about travelling to the EU after October 31, when the UK may leave the bloc without any clear travel arrangements. The weakening pound is buying less sangria than ever, fuel is only getting more expensive and staff wages are on the rise. Step forward Philip Meeson, the former pilot whose Jet2 brand now operates a fleet of almost 100 aircraft and has quietly become the second-biggest UK leisure travel business by market share. The former British air acrobatic champion likes to fly under the radar. He operates from an unassuming office in Leeds and despite floating the parent company, Dart Group, in 1991, has never courted publicity. “He doesn’t see the need. He just wants to get on and deliver,” says one adviser. Meeson spends time with investors and analysts in the City but little with the reporters that make or break reputations there. The numbers do his talking: Dart’s revenues for the year to March 31, 2019 rose 32 per cent to £3.14bn. Adjusted pre-tax profit was up 63 per cent to £180.1m, ahead of forecasts. Jet2 revenue was up 34 per cent to £2.96bn. The competition is distracted. Monarch Airlines went bust in 2017. With £1.2bn debt, Thomas Cook tried to sell its airline — the only profitable part of its operation — before switching flight path with a proposed £900m bailout by its lenders and its largest shareholder, the Chinese conglomerate Fosun. The sale is paused, rather than cancelled. By contrast, Dart had net cash of £291m at the end of its full year. These are advanced payments for holidays that will be taken next summer. It operates online, without expensive shops to maintain. Mr Meeson bought a company called Channel Express in 1983. Its main job was flying fresh flowers from the Channel Islands to the UK. He expanded into postal services and other cargo and added a trucking arm. This is called Fowler Welch and accounts for about 10 per cent of Dart’s turnover. In 2003 Jet2 carried its first passengers from Leeds Bradford airport to Amsterdam. In 2007 Jet2holidays was established. Half the airline’s passengers are on a package holiday, allowing Jet2 to fill seats and capture more of its customers’ spending.

16,Peter Lynch,Peter Lynch. Who Is Peter Lynch. KEY TAKEAWAYS. Getting to Know Peter Lynch. Peter Lynch’s Investing Career. Invest in What,"Peter Lynch is one of the most successful and well-known investors of all time. Lynch is the legendary former manager of the Magellan Fund at the major investment brokerage Fidelity. He took over the fund in 1977 at age 33 and ran it for 13 years. His success allowed him to retire in 1990 at age 46. His investment style has been described as adaptive to the prevailing economic environment at the time, but Lynch always stressed that you should be able to understand what you own. Lynch developed an interest in the stock market through conversations he overheard while working as a caddy at an upscale golf club when he was 11. This was during a time when the stock market was performing well. He attended Boston College on a partial scholarship and paid the rest of his way by caddying. He graduated in 1965 with a degree in finance. In 1966 he worked as a summer student at Fidelity. One of Lynch’s first successful investments was in an air-freight company called Flying Tiger, which helped him pay for graduate school. He earned a master’s in business administration (MBA) from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He served in the Army from 1967 through 1969. At age 25, Lynch got his first full-time job as a textiles and metals analyst at Fidelity. Having caddied for the company’s president for eight years undoubtedly helped him get the job. In 1977, Lynch took over the Magellan Fund, a small, aggressive capital appreciation fund created in 1963 that held mostly domestic investments. An investor who put $1,000 into the fund the day Lynch took over would have had $28,000 the day he left. Under his management, the fund returned an average of 29 percent per year and outperformed the S&P 500 for all but two years. Many investors commonly point to Lynch as an example that active management can achieve superior results relative to the benchmark. Lynch is credited with inventing the price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio, which helps investors determine whether a stock is inexpensive given its growth potential, along with other stock valuation methods popular with value investors. Lynch thinks individual investors can perform well by investing in what they know and by getting to know a company, its business model, and its fundamentals. Lynch believes in investing for the long term and choosing companies whose","Aug 18, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peterlynch.asp

18,3 Reasons Why There’s Money to Be Made in The Garbage Market,3 Reasons Why There’S Money To Be Made In The Garbage Market. Perhaps some of the best stock picks are,"It has even been said by some of the best investors of our time, like Peter Lynch, that “a company that does boring things is almost as good as a company that has a boring name, and both together is terrific.” Check out our 3 dull stocks with exciting potential to confirm for yourself. One such company’s name is Waste Management (NYSE: WM), and the service provided is just that, managing our waste! According to what Peter Lynch said, this is a company that’s off to a great start in terms of a boring name and a boring company.  What’s more, it carries the majority market share, has the largest network of landfills in the U.S., is leading the market in its growth sentiment towards “going green” and, whether you knew it or not, is actually a holdings company that consists of hundreds of subsidiary waste management services.  Here’s more on why it’s a great pick for both conservative and long-term investors… Some may wonder if having such a large share of the market carries the risk of being labeled a monopoly, but don’t forget that WM is actually a holdings company of hundreds of subsidiary owned companies, 437 subsidiaries to be exact. In other words, when investing in WM, you’re putting your money to bat for over 400 companies and in 38% of the waste management industry. Furthermore, of the 437 companies owned by WM, ownership in 247 solid waste landfills, 5 secure hazardous waste landfills, 102 material recovery facilities, and 314 transfer stations is included.  Among the subsidiary companies include a diverse range of niche companies that provide the following diverse services within the waste management industry: · Waste management services for residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers · Waste collection services · WM owns, develops and operates multiple landfills, this includes ownership in the real estate, as well as the revenue from operations of the landfills · Materials processing services · Commodities recycling services · Recycling brokerage services for third party companies (this means that, even for the companies within the industry that it doesn’t own, it is providing services for and taking a small share of revenues!) · Construction and remediation services As you can see, it’s almost an understatement to say that WM has its hand in nearly every area of the waste management industry, a positive indicator of a potentially great","Aug 19, 2019",https://blog.mywallst.com/3-reasons-why-theres-money-to-be-made-in-the-garbage-market/
