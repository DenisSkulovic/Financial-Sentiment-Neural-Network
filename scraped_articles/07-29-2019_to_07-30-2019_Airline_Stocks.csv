1,Why Electric Airplanes Are About to Take Off,Why Electric Airplanes Are About to Take Off. . What It Means for Investors. Looking Ahead. Compete Risk Free with,"Aviation has come along away since the Wright brothers invented the first successful airplane around the turn of the twentieth century. Today, aerospace giants like Boeing Co. (BA), Airbus SE, and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU) are investing in startups and projects to develop autonomous-flying electric aircrafts with vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. Even Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) has plans to expand its transportation services to the airways, according to a recent story by The Wall Street Journal.    California-based startup Ampaire recently test flew a five-passenger aircraft with a retrofitted electric motor powering a propeller in the back of the plane. While the plane still used a normal combustion engine for the propeller at the nose of the plane, the successful flight of this hybrid aircraft offers a glimpse into the not-too-distant future of aviation.  “It’s kind of like a plug-in hybrid car,” Kevin Noertker, co-founder and chief executive of Ampaire, said. “We are really riding the coattails of ground electric vehicles here.” At a time when climate change is becoming an imminent threat to the planet and the aviation industry contributes 2% to 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, electrifying commercial aircraft will become the new goal for innovative startups and industry leaders alike. Electric motors also produce less heat than turbine engines, which makes them cheaper to maintain. Both the fuel efficiencies and cheaper maintenance will provide significant cost savings. Ampaire’s retrofit, originally a Cessna Skymaster, can travel up to 200 miles on a single charge, uses 55% less fuel than an unmodified plane, and costs up to 50% less to maintain. Another California-based startup, Wright Electric, is planning to retrofit a nine-passenger plane with a hybrid engine, which is expected to offer fuel savings of up to 20%. One major decision companies are currently facing is whether to design completely new aircraft or simply to retrofit existing models with electric motors. Retrofitting may allow companies to release their models for commercial production soon, since those models are likely to face less regulatory hurdles. However, new designs are likely to win in the long term.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FFA) said that approvals for design changes can take many years. But, at least with retrofits, “you already know the airframe works,” Dean Donovan, managing director at aviation-and-travel investment firm DiamondStream Partners, told the Journal. “All you’re really doing is replacing the propulsion system.” Yet,","Jul 29, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/why-electric-airplanes-are-about-to-take-off-4706531
2,Will This Stock Be the Big Winner in the WestJet (TSX:WJA) Deal? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Will This Stock Be the Big Winner in the WestJet (TSX:WJA) Deal?.,"      David Jagielski | July 29, 2019 | More on: AC Last week, we learned that WestJet Airlines shareholders had overwhelming support for a deal from Onex that would take the company private. With 92.5% of shareholders voting in favour of the proposed takeover, it clears a big hurdle for WestJet and Onex. We first learned of the deal back in May, however, there are still has some approvals and conditions that need to be satisfied before it can be closed. One stock that could be the biggest beneficiary as a result of the move is none other than WestJet’s biggest rival, Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B). Since May, Air Canada’s stock has risen around 40%, and part of that has had to do with the news that the company was looking to acquire Air Transat. The stock was already doing well over the past 12 months, as it has nearly doubled in value. More traffic along with a contained and low price of oil have helped the airline produce some strong results in recent years. And there’s little reason to see that changing anytime soon with the economy still doing very well. Tomorrow, the company is expected to release its second-quarter results, which could show even further growth. Air Canada stock is coming off a new 52-week high, and what’s remarkable is that despite its strong stock performance over the past year, it’s still trading at only 18 times earnings and less than four times its book value. The stock is still a good buy and it could continue to rise, especially if the company releases strong results on Tuesday. One of the big reasons that a stock like Air Canada could benefit from WestJet going private is the need for investors to diversify their portfolios. While investors could certainly go the ETF route, there are many that still prefer to hold individual stocks. And that’s where having fewer airline stocks to choose from may help drive up the value for Air Canada. Given that oil prices have looked to have stabilized and don’t appear to be increasing, an airline stock could be a very attractive buy, since fuel costs play a significant role in how strong its bottom line looks. And investing in a stock like Air Canada is a good way to hedge an investment in an oil and gas stock, which could be","Jul 29, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/07/29/will-this-stock-be-the-big-winner-in-the-westjet-tsxwja-deal/

What Lufthansa said,"Lufthansa has seen its second quarter earnings plummet amid a price war with rivals based in Germany and Austria and “persistent overcapacities” in the airline market. Adjusted earnings before tax dropped 25 per cent from €1bn (£91.6m) to €754m, The airline said this was because fuel costs were €255m higher than they were in the second quarter of the previous year.

Adjusted free cash flow fell to €91m, down by more than 50 per cent from April to June in 2018. Lufthansa’s share price fell nearly six per cent. Lufthansa last issued a profit warning in June, dragging down airline stocks in the process. The Germain airline is feeling the effects of overcapacity in the market and rival carrier competition for falling ticket prices in Europe. Lufthansa’s Network Airlines, consisting of Lufthansa German Airlines, Swiss and Austrian Airlines, and Eurowings, its low-cost subsidiary, are failing to take off in these tough market conditions. Lufthansa said Network Airlines would see “above average” development for the second half of the year but warned that “gloomier” economic prospects in its home markets have increased the chances of a weaker performance than that reported in the first half. For Eurowings, Lufthansa’s low-cost division, adjusted losses increased from €220m to €273m in the first half of 2019, despite a boost in capacity and a decline in flight cancellations. Chief financial officer Ulrik Svensson said: “Our earnings are feeling the effects of tough competition in Europe and sizeable overcapacities, especially on our short-haul routes out of Germany and Austria.

4,Volaris' Comeback Continues With Stellar Q2 Earnings | The Motley Fool,Volaris' Comeback Continues With Stellar Q2 Earnings. The Mexican budget airline is benefiting from strong demand and its industry-leading cost,"   After a stellar run of soaring profits and huge stock price gains in 2015 and 2016, Volaris (NYSE:VLRS) hit the skids beginning in late 2016. Over the following two years, a combination of rising fuel prices, depreciation of the Mexican peso, periodic overcapacity in the Mexican domestic and transborder air travel markets, and the U.S. crackdown on illegal immigration drove massive erosion of Volaris' profitability. Indeed, Volaris' adjusted operating margin, which stood at 11.7% in 2016 and 13.8% in 2015, came in just below breakeven in 2017 and fell further into negative territory last year. Not surprisingly, this caused the stock to plunge, too.  VOLARIS STOCK PERFORMANCE. DATA BY YCHARTS. However, market conditions have improved dramatically over the past year. As a result, Volaris is capitalizing on its strong competitive advantages again, driving a rapid earnings recovery. Volaris took advantage of strong demand to increase its capacity 21.6% year over year in the second quarter. Despite this substantial capacity growth, revenue per available seat mile (RASM) surged 10.1%. This caused revenue to jump 33.7%, reaching 8.3 billion pesos ($435 million). Meanwhile, Volaris continued its efforts to steadily reduce its unit costs. Measured in pesos, nonfuel unit costs fell 4.6% year over year last quarter. Total unit costs declined 1.2%, as higher fuel costs -- related to new fees on jet fuel purchases imposed by Pemex in Mexico -- partially offset the decline in nonfuel unit costs. The net result was that Volaris' operating margin improved by 10.5 percentage points year over year, reaching 7.9%. For the first half of the year, the company's operating margin rose 10.3 percentage points to 4.4%. VOLARIS' PROFIT MARGIN HAS SURGED BACK INTO POSITIVE TERRITORY THIS YEAR. IMAGE SOURCE: VOLARIS. Volaris' comeback began in the second half of 2018, so the carrier will face tougher year-over-year comparisons in the current quarter and beyond. Nevertheless, management expects further earnings improvement in this seasonally stronger period. For Q3, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent (EBITDAR) should exceed 30% of revenue. For comparison, Volaris' EBITDAR margin was 26.7% in the year-ago period. It's also worth noting that Volaris easily exceeded its margin guidance in the first two quarters of 2019. From a longer-term perspective, Volaris has plenty of potential margin expansion drivers.

Growth on Hawaii routes by longtime rivals such as United Airlines -- combined with new competition from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) -- has undermined unit revenue at Hawaiian Airlines. Meanwhile, unit costs have continued to rise. These trends continued last quarter, for the most part. That said, the Hawaiian Airlines parent still achieved a solid double-digit profit margin.

In mid-March, Southwest Airlines added six flights a day from Oakland and San Jose to Hawaii. (It has added some interisland service within Hawaii, too.) The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX has caused a delay in launching additional routes, but Southwest's management recently indicated that the carrier will start selling tickets for flights from Sacramento and San Diego to Hawaii soon. Those flights will probably begin near year-end or early in 2020. During the second quarter, Hawaiian Airlines continued its efforts to reshape its route network in light of this new competition from Southwest. Near the beginning of the quarter, it began flying nonstop from Sacramento to Maui -- front-running potential Southwest flights on that route -- while reducing capacity on its existing Sacramento-Honolulu route, which is sure to face competition from Southwest Airlines fairly soon. Around the same time, Hawaiian Airlines also began flying to Boston, offering the first nonstop flights between that big market and Hawaii. HAWAIIAN AIRLINES BEGAN TWO NEW ROUTES LAST QUARTER.

6,GE needs to clear this level for the turnaround to be real,"GE needs to clear this level for the turnaround to be real, chart suggests. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips.","General Electric has powered up this year. The onetime market dud has soared more than 40% in 2019, on pace for its first positive year in three and tracking for its best annual gain in two decades. It had spent the previous two years in free fall with investors unconvinced its turnaround efforts were gaining traction. It still needs to clear another hurdle as it heads into its earnings report Wednesday, according to one technician. “It’s too early to call it a bullish long-term turnaround,” said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “There’s been a loss of long-term downside momentum relative to 2017 and 2018 but it’s really fallen short of breaking out and solidifying that bullish reversal.” Despite its strong gains this year, the stock remains in a bear market having fallen more than 20% from a 52-week high last October. It is still 82% below its record set in 2000. “The resistance level that I’m watching is about $10.70 so a breakout that’s confirmed, meaning you spend a couple of weeks above that level, would really solidify a turnaround for GE in my eyes which has really just been range-bound and somewhat neutral in terms of momentum,” said Stockton.  A move to $10.70 is roughly a 2% gain from current levels. It last touched that level a week ago before retreating. “On the downside, I’m watching minor support around $9.75. I’d like to see that level remain intact at least to preserve the neutral bias of the chart but we really need that breakout to get excited about it,” said Stockton. Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Butcher Joseph Asset Management, also needs to see the fundamentals improve before she’s willing to believe in the GE rebound. “The market has given the company and the stock price the benefit of the doubt on the turnaround ... but from here we need to see sustainable earnings and free cash flow growth,” Tengler said in the same “Trading Nation” segment. Adjusted earnings are expected to fall by around 33% in its June-ended quarter, according to FactSet. In the same quarter a year earlier, earnings declined by a sharper 44%. “Long term the only way you can look at this company is sum of the parts.

7,(LEAD) S. Korean airlines reduce flights to Japan amid trade row | Yonhap News Agency,. Ex-presidential candidate to announce bid for Seoul mayoral by-election. . . . . . . . . . .,"          (ATTN: ADDS stock prices and analyst comments in paras 9-13)
By Choi Kyong-ae SEOUL, July 30 (Yonhap) -- South Korean airlines have suspended services or plan to reduce the number of flights on some Japanese routes as outbound travel demand falls amid escalating trade tensions with the neighboring country. On Tuesday, Asiana Airlines Inc. said it will reduce the number of flights on the routes to Japanese destinations, such as Fukuoka, Osaka and Okinawa, starting from mid-September. Asiana is the latest among local airlines that have decided to readjust flight schedules to Japan as an increasing number of South Koreans are expected to choose other countries for vacations. A day earlier, top carrier Korean Air Lines Co. said it will suspend its Busan-Sapporo route from September for the same reason. Korean Air plans to cease its three regular weekly flights between the Korean southern port city and the northeastern Japanese city beginning Sept. 3. The country's biggest full-service carrier said it will provide domestic flight services to bring those who have booked the Busan-Sapporo route to Incheon International Airport and then have them use the Incheon-Sapporo route. Korean Air had been considering dropping the route due to tougher competition with low-cost carriers, but a recent sharp decline in travel demand from Busan to Sapporo precipitated the decision, the company said. Low-cost carriers, such as Air Busan Co., Eastar Jet and T'way Air, were quick to respond to sagging travel demand to Japan. They have already announced plans to reduce flights on routes from South Korean cities, like Daegu and Busan, to less popular Japanese cities, such as Narita, Oita and Kumamoto. Jeju Air Co., the country's biggest budget carrier, joined its smaller rivals. It plans to reduce flights on ""less-profitable"" routes to Japan though the particular routes have yet to be decided, a company spokesman said. On Tuesday, airline stocks were mixed across the board. Korean Air ended flat at 26,050 won, Asiana closed down 0.7 percent to 5,960 won and Asiana's budget carrier unit, Air Busan, fell 1.5 percent to 6,660 won. But Jeju Air, the country's biggest low-cost carrier, jumped 7 percent to 27,550 won, Korean Air's budget carrier unit Jin Air Co. rose 2.6 percent to 15,800 won and T'way rebounded 2.1 percent to 5,350 won after recent declines.

12,Famous Investors - Examples and investment styles,Famous Investors. Famous Investors. Carl Icahn. Benjamin Graham. Warren Buffett. Additional Resources. Financial Analyst Training. ,"The following article lists some of the most famous investors, based on their ability to generate returns. This list includes investors that have managed portfolios and created new methods of investing. Famous investors in this list include Carl Icahn, Benjamin Graham, and Warren Buffet.      Known as a corporate raider, Carl Icahn made a fortune by buying large stakes in a company, obtaining control, and directing company strategy to benefit shareholders. Icahn believed that companies are often run by management that does not want to bring change and boards that do not hold management responsible. Icahn identifies such companies, brings change, and increases shareholder value. Most common ways Icahn creates profit include: While Icahn adds value to shareholders, he doesn’t always do the best for companies. In 1985, he purchased 20% of the shares of Trans World Airlines (TWA) and took the airline private. This moved made Icahn $469 million but put the airline $540 million in debt. He also sold TWA London routes to American Airlines. The routes were extremely profitable and valuable for TWA. When TWA filed for bankruptcy, the airline came up with a strategy called the Karabu ticket agreement which allowed Icahn to purchase flight tickets and sell them at a discount. This was disadvantageous for TWA, as they had to lower ticket costs to compete with the tickets Icahn was selling. This strategy cost TWA $100 million per year.   Benjamin Graham was an investor, economist, and professor. Known as the father of value investing, he wrote two books that showcased his knowledge: “Security Analysis”, with David Dodd, and “The Intelligent Investor”. Tips from Graham include: In value investing, the main rule is to look at the intrinsic value of the firm. If the intrinsic value is lower than the market value, an investor should hold the stock until a mean reversion. The mean reversion is where the market price and intrinsic prices converge. While talking about value investing, Graham describes the market price as “Mr. Market”, which goes through optimistic and pessimistic periods. When Mr. Market is optimistic, try to sell at a high price. But when he is pessimistic, buy at a low price. To avoid buying the stock or selling at the wrong time, always look at the intrinsic value. Mr. Market is emotional and is always willing to buy or sell a stock at different prices.","Jul 30, 2019",https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/famous-investors/

There are the actual research and development costs over many years that need to be recouped; there is the size of the market for the drug; there are the pricing arrangements negotiated with pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies; there are the out-of-pocket costs paid by the consumer; there are the regulatory burdens that add expense to the production, manufacturing, and distribution of the medication; and there is the question of competition. CEO pay has nothing whatsoever to do with drug pricing.

The stock price has fallen nearly 60% over the last 12 months and its current price of $15/share is well off its peak of nearly $100/share in 2013. Do the fundamentals present a buying opportunity, or is the business a prime example of a value trap? A value trap is a stock which appears inexpensive on the surface but trades at low multiples for a reason, such as no future promise for growth or the business is fundamentally weak. To begin, the valuations look phenomenal and are almost too good to be true. The current P/E of 3.97, is well below the industry average of 28.6; Price sales of 0.4, is extremely inexpensive against the industry average of 3.8; and Price/Cash Flow of 14.2, also looks favorable compared to the industry average of 22.9. The stock also offers an enticing yield of 7.29%, and the company’s payout ratio of 54.5% looks strong enough to maintain sustainability of the payments. Since the yield is so high, I would want to take a closer look at cash flow and earnings to see what they are expected to be. If the company suffers a slowdown or has a blip in earnings, the dividend yield would likely be the first thing to go along with a further decline in the stock price. Growth has likely weighed on the stock price, and although EPS has climbed 6% over the last 12 months, sales have fallen 11.4% during the same time frame. If the company cannot get a hold of sales and return to growth, it could be a major problem for the business. The decline in sales isn’t the only major concern I have with this company and although estimated December 2020 GAAP EPS of $3.59 would produce a target sell price of $59.24, the cons outweigh the pros. When we are looking at buying a business, we always start at point A and look to make it to point Z with complete clarity. Even if there are some enticing points along the way, if we cannot fully understand the business or if it has significant problems, we will not buy the business. On top of declining sales, the balance sheet for Tupperware Brands is a major concern. The current ratio of 0.85, is below the mark of 1.0, I generally like to see.","Jul 30, 2019",https://www.wilseyassetmanagement.com/does-tupperware-brands-store-return-potential
