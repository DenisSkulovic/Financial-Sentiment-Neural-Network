2,3 Warren Buffett Stocks Worth Buying Now | The Motley Fool,3 Warren Buffett Stocks Worth Buying Now. Here are three potentially undervalued stocks from Berkshire Hathaway's stock holdings.. An innovative,"   We are 10 years into a bull market, but that doesn't mean there are not good values to be found. Whether you're looking for growth or value, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) is a good place to find investment ideas. Currently, Berkshire Hathaway holds shares of RH (NYSE:RH), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and General Motors(NYSE:GM). Here is why each stock is a buy. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Earlier in the year, RH, formally known as Restoration Hardware, saw its stock plunge after earnings results came in below expectations. However, the fiscal second-quarter report showed revenue growth accelerating to 10% year over year. The sales increase reflects recent efforts to improve the in-store experience by opening new galleries in major cities with the integrated RH Hospitality experience. Management believes there is an opportunity to reach $4 billion to $5 billion in revenue, as RH begins to expand overseas and shift its focus from merely selling products to selling concepts and ideas for customers. Because of the growth potential that lies ahead, management believes the stock is undervalued and has been considering share repurchases.  The investment gurus at Berkshire Hathaway clearly see a value, too. RH emerged as a new holding for Berkshire in the third quarter. The latest 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Berkshire purchased 1.2 million shares last quarter, which would currently be worth $218 million. It's a tiny position, which means it probably wasn't Buffett but one of the two investment managers (Todd Combs or Ted Weschler) who bought the stock for Berkshire. The shares currently trade for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.7 times analysts' earnings estimates next year. Analysts expect RH to grow earnings by 25% per year over the next five years. The stock has already rebounded strongly from the lows earlier this year, but at the current valuation and with growth opportunities so abundant, the stock could be undervalued at current levels.  Buffett has been a believer in the big banks. Berkshire owns large stakes in several, and its largest bank holding is Bank of America. At the end of the third quarter, Berkshire owned 927 million shares, a stake worth $32.5 billion.  Bank of America is Berkshire's second-largest holding overall, and it's easy to see why Buffett likes it. CEO Brian Moynihan has cut out $30 billion in operating costs since 2010.","Nov 25, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/25/3-warren-buffett-stocks-worth-buying-now.aspx

On November 18, Boeing announced that SunExpress, a joint venture between Turkish Airlines and Germany’s Lufthansa, had exercised options for 10 additional Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $1.2bn according to list prices. The SunExpress-Boeing deal came less than a week after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to the US to deal with tensions between Turkey and its Nato ally.

Former spies in the elite intelligence service say it is always on the lookout for recruits as it adapts to new dangers in the region, and that television programmes such as Apple TV's ""Tehran"" and Netflix's ""The Spy,"" are fuelling applications. “When people see the James Bond movies, or Tehran, they want to be a part of it,” former Mossad agent Avner Avraham, who says it was 007 that first drew him to the service, told the Daily Telegraph. “You can travel, the government pays you, it's fun, it's sometimes dangerous and you are very proud to serve your country...and so people want to join,"" said Mr Avraham, who worked as a Mossad officer for 28 years. “Tehran” in particular has some parallels with events unfolding in the real world today, as it features a young, female undercover Mossad agent on operations in the Iranian capital.

8,Index Funds May Be a Better Choice for New Investors,Investing in Index Funds. Save Money by Investing in Low-Cost Index Funds. Gain Diversification at a Fraction of the Cost.,"Successful investing usually depends on avoiding major mistakes. You need to acquire a diversified collection of great assets at good prices, hold them in a tax-efficient way for long periods (often spanning 25 years or more), and let time do the rest. Index funds are an excellent way for investors to harness this approach. Index funds are designed to track a specific index or the overall performance of the stock market. Because there are no active managers trying to ""beat the market,"" they can often provide strong returns at a very low cost. In practical terms, for every $100,000 you have in a Roth IRA or 401(k), you would indirectly pay $100 in fees to the money management company; in contrast, you would have to pay $2,000 in fees if you had a more actively managed fund. Simply put, you could save an extra $1,900 per year. Over a longer time period, savings can accumulate to hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars. When you invest in low-cost index funds, the management fee or expense ratio can be as low as 0.10% of assets per year compared to 1% or 2% for other types of mutual funds. At times, this trade-off is not worthwhile. For example, in many situations, a registered investment advisor or private wealth management firm offers substantial added value in terms of, among other things, tax strategy, risk control, and generational transfer assistance (e.g., use of family limited partnerships and liquidity discounts to get around gift tax limits). But, in such scenarios, you should be wary of paying more than 1.5% per year in management fees.  If you are a small investor who wants to replicate the S&P 500 by directly buying shares of each of the 500 stocks, you would need to spend thousands of dollars in commissions and invest millions of dollars. This is not true for larger investors who typically pay half-a-penny per share in transaction costs due to rebalancing or other adjustment transactions that are handled by a software program. Many discount brokerages have started offering index funds with small or even no minimum investment requirements. In 2018, Fidelity Investment made headlines when it began offering four index funds with no minimum investment and no transaction fees. Low-cost index funds have become so popular that there are now funds that cover all types of investment mandates and asset allocations.

Two Hong Kong stocks took a 90%+ wipeout this week, exposing yet more inflated asset bubbles in Asia. The phenomenon makes bitcoin seem calm. By: Ben Brown | Email | Leave a comment One of the world’s best-performing stocks just took a 98% hammering when its over-inflated bubble popped. ArtGo, a marble company listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, climbed 3,800% since January, then saw most of its value wiped out in a matter of hours. Just one day before the bubble burst, the Wall Street Journal shed light on the outrageous valuation. Shares of ArtGo Holdings have become unhinged from the reality of the underlying company. The share price equates to 85 times revenue, more expensive than some of the fastest-growing tech companies. The actual trigger came hours later when MSCI announced it would no longer include ArtGo in its China Index. The selling was so vicious, trading was suspended. This isn’t a freak occurrence on the Hong Kong stock market. On the same day, another Asian stock collapsed 91% and had to be suspended. Kasen International – a furniture company and property developer – had seen a bubble grow 548% since 2018. It was pierced in seconds by a savage bout of short-selling by Blue Orca Capital. Earlier in the year, a Chinese stock listed in Hong Kong – Ding Yi Feng – snapped after an 8,500% streak.

Here’s what Warren Buffett’s latest investment tells us about the propriety of investing in the stock market while it sits at record highs. By: Joseph Young | Email | Leave a comment Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway purchased about $234 million worth of RH shares earlier this month, making a rare acquisition amid one of the strongest stock market rallies in recent history. With high profile investors forecasting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average could surge as high as 30,000 within the near future, Berkshire’s recent deal could indicate that the investment firm does not intend simply to sit out as the markets soar.   In early November, CNBC reported that it had been almost four years since Warren Buffett’s last major acquisition, despite the strong performance of Berkshire-backed companies. As Berkshire’s businesses continued to succeed in generating cash, analysts remained puzzled about Buffett’s reluctance to go on a spending spree. The $532 billion investment firm has likely not found many deals to its liking. Berkshire targets companies that are undervalued by the market and expected to scale. RH seems to be the first “undervalued” firm it has found in quite some time. Due to the relatively small size of the deal in comparison to Berkshire’s previous investments, David Kass, University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business finance professor, told Bloomberg that executives other than Buffett and Charlie Munger most likely led the deal. Kass said: Maybe they saw a certain growth opportunity here that other analysts are missing.

Time is","      Ryan Vanzo | November 24, 2019 | More on: CU EMA H TFSAs are one of the greatest tools in Canadian history for getting rich. You can contribute more than $60,000 to a newly opened TFSA, and the money can grow tax-free for as long as it remains in the account. Did I mention withdrawals are tax-free too? It’s basically free money. If you have a TFSA, congratulations. The question now becomes, how do you become a millionaire? It begins in steps. After all, a few thousand dollars rarely becomes millions overnight. Instead, you’ll need to think in chunks. For example, if you have $10,000 in your TFSA, you shouldn’t focus on some far-off goal that will take decades to achieve. Rather, turn your focus to goals that are reachable in a matter of years. Long-term investing is key, but focusing on short-term savings goals can making saving more enjoyable and increase your odds of reaching your targets. After a target is met, set another, more aggressive goal. If you have $10,000 in your TFSA, your next goal should be to grow that amount to $50,000. Sounds a lot easier than getting to $1 million, right? That’s exactly the point. So, how do you turn $10,000 into $50,000? Just use a simple method called the time value of money. You’ve heard of the saying “time is money,” yeah? That’s good advice, but it’s true in more ways than one. There’s a concept in finance called the time value of money, and it shows how time literally is money. Here’s an example. If you have $10,000 invested in the market, earning 8% per year, it’ll grow to $21,600 after 10 years. If you keep all the assumptions exactly the same but double the time to 20 years, that same $10,000 will grow to $46,600. All we did was change the time, and your nest egg more than doubled. This isn’t the most complex thing to understand, but it’s critical. Time is money. Nearly every investor focuses on saving more money and picking the right stocks, when in reality, they should be focused on maximizing their time. How do you do that? Start investing today! The earlier you invest, the longer those dollars have to compound in value. Investing a few hundred dollars today could be equivalent to investing thousands of dollars in the future.

14,"Sell your WestJet stock, this fund manager says - Cantech Letter","Sell your WestJet stock, this fund manager says. WestJet stock has regulatory risk…. About The Author / Nick Waddell. Cantech","      Is Burcon Nutrascience still cheap? Healthcare stock picks from Mackie RBC, BlackBerry Wishpond begins trading    Shareholders of WestJet ( WestJet Stock Quote, Chart, News TSX:WJA) were handsomely rewarded back in May when the deal was announced that could see Onex Corp pick up Canada’s #2 airline for $5 billion. But is there any value to holding onto the stock now that the share price has shot up close to the deal’s $31 per share asking price? Not at all, says John O’Connell of Davis Rea Investment Counsel, who advises that the risk/reward is unfavourable. It’s been a busy year for both Canada’s airlines and for the regulatory bodies tasked with poring over the nuts and bolts of two major still-pending transactions. First up was Air Canada, which surprised earlier this year with a plan to buy Transat AT Inc, whose Air Transat holiday airline stands as Canada’s third-largest carrier, for now roughly $720 million or $18 per share. That deal was approved by Transat shareholders in August but will likely have to wait until next spring to get a decision from Transport Canada on whether it’s in the public interest to shrink competition among Canadian carriers. Next was the May bombshell that private equity firm Onex had put in a friendly offer to buy WestJet and take it private. And along with the regulatory approvals — of which the deal has already received approval by an Alberta court in September — the acquisition is facing another potential hurdle in the form of a challenge by Air Canada on the grounds of foreign ownership. But while WJA shareholders have made out well when the stock jumped from $18 to $30 overnight in May, the chance for further upside to its current price of $30.63 is not worth the gamble, says O’Connell, who spoke to BNN Bloomberg on Friday. “It’s under review by the government to see whether the takeover is going to take place, so you’re into a realm of dealing with regulatory uncertainty, and if you bought the stock before the takeover was announced, unless you are really in tune with what is likely to unfold I wouldn’t own the stock any longer,” says O’Connell, chairman and CEO of Davis Rea. “You’re being paid a fair price.

15,7 urban air mobility companies to watch | Greenbiz,7 urban air mobility companies to watch. 1. Airbus. 2. Joby Aviation. 3. Kitty Hawk. 4.  Lilium . 5.,"By Shane Downing November 25, 2019 An urban airplane, the Lilium Jet, with a view of Manhattan in the background. As urban planners, public transit agencies, and walking and biking advocates work to steer cities away from a future congested with cars — and as others discuss the ethics, realities and regulations of autonomous vehicles — a growing number of companies is less concerned with city streets and more interested in flying over them. Since 2018, the number of electric aircraft in development worldwide has increased by 50 percent. Roughly 200 electric aviation companies are backed by more than $1 billion from investors. Whereas a good chunk of those companies are targeting the commercial airline industry, urban air mobility (UAM) is getting more attention — think ride-hailing flying taxis, electric multicopters and passenger drones that can be summoned with an app. It may sound like a far-off, Jetsons-esque pipedream, but some urban mobility pioneers are aiming to offer air taxi service within the next five years, despite the inherent challenges with battery technology and aviation regulations at the city, state and federal level.  Some forecasts suggest that within 20 years, electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft manufacturers, operators and infrastructure providers will have a market value of $318 billion. In the United States, the eVTOL market could be valued at $17.7 billion annually by 2040.  Similar to what’s happened with all-electric cars, unexpected obstacles undoubtedly will pop up in the air. For example, there currently aren’t enough air traffic controllers to handle an influx of flights across cities. The debate over autonomous vehicles also covers the skies, and one fatal accident could set the industry back years.   In the meantime, here are seven UAM companies to watch in the next 12 months. Airbus, the multinational European aerospace company, is developing two electric UAM vehicles with the goal to offer short-hop flights across congested big cities and from suburbs to city centers for a price that’s competitive with traditional ground taxi service. Airbus’ first vehicle is the autonomous eVTOL Vahana demonstrator, being developed by Airbus A³, the company’s Silicon Valley team. The self-piloted air taxi is capable of carrying a single passenger in a forward-facing cockpit, and the prototype has a range of about 31 miles, or 20 minutes of flight time. The Vahana’s batteries make up nearly 40 percent of the vehicle’s weight. As of","Nov 25, 2019",https://www.greenbiz.com/article/7-urban-air-mobility-companies-watch

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Anna Gross in London A pioneering Brazilian carbon trader is buying back a boutique he founded more than 20 years ago, betting that a new offsetting scheme for the airline sector will trigger copycat initiatives around the world. Pedro Moura Costa, who has a multi-decade career developing carbon offsetting schemes, has agreed to buy back UK-based EcoSecurities, an early developer of greenhouse gas emissions schemes which he founded in 1997. It listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005, and was taken private by JPMorgan in 2009. The move reflects apparently brighter prospects for the global carbon trading market, which has struggled over the past decade but is now seeing a revival as developing economies and high-emitting industries sign up to reduction targets. “[The purchase was] strategic — we can see a surge in demand coming our way and we want to be ready to react to that,” said Mr Costa, declining to disclose the price he paid for EcoSecurities. “We’ll play into the existing markets and will make ourselves ready for the ones that are arriving.” The business of “offsetting’, in which individuals and companies calculate emissions and then purchase equivalent credits from projects that prevent or remove greenhouse gases elsewhere, has been contentious. Critics claim it allows big emitters to buy credits in exchange for a clean conscience while continuing to pollute with abandon. Initiatives on the horizon include the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), which will require airlines to buy credits to offset carbon dioxide emissions in excess of stipulated targets. The first phase of Corsia will begin in 2021, and rules on eligible carbon credits are set to be announced next month at a UN climate change conference in Madrid. “We are gearing ourselves to be one of the major suppliers of credits in the Corsia market,” said Mr Costa, who recently returned to London from Brazil where he was working on domestic green finance initiatives. “But you have all kinds of other sectoral targets emerging; the shipping and maritime sector is going to be the next one.” Some analysts caution against excessive optimism, since investors in the sector have been burned in the past. “It seems like a good time to bet on the credit market, but it is still pretty uncertain,” said Nicolas Girod, managing director at ClearBlue Markets, an Amsterdam-based energy broker.","Nov 25, 2019",https://www.ft.com/content/9410c400-0f5f-11ea-a225-db2f231cfeae
18,Airline caterers plan protests at major US airports Thanksgiving week,Airline catering workers planning protests at major US airports Thanksgiving week. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"Hundreds of airline catering workers are protesting this week at some of the largest U.S. airports to demand higher wages and better benefits during what’s expected to be a record Thanksgiving travel period. Some of those workers, who prepare and deliver meals to airlines and are represented by the Unite Here labor union, are planning to block airport roads or stage sit-ins around ticket counters and pre-security areas on Tuesday at airports including those serving New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Philadelphia. Others plan to picket and hand out pamphlets about their demands, according to the union, which represents more than 20,000 airline catering workers. Airlines for America, a trade group, expects a record 31.6 million travelers to fly on U.S. airlines during the 12 days around Thanksgiving, up nearly 4% from last year. The protests are the latest demonstrations by emboldened workers who are demanding a bigger share of corporate profits, which have surged since the last recession more than a decade ago. Airline workers have been particularly visible this year after airlines reported disruptions they said were due to workers trying to gain leverage in contract talks. President Donald Trump signed a bill ending the longest-ever government shutdown in January, hours after a shortage of air traffic controllers disrupted flights. The workers are employed by LSG Sky Chefs and Gate Gourmet, which big airlines subcontract to provide on-board food and beverages. The union contends that some workers don’t earn enough to keep up with the cost of living and is arguing for a nationwide wage of at least $15 an hour. Robert Ortiz said he makes $18 an hour driving a catering delivery truck at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport for LSG Sky Chefs, which is controlled by Deutsche Lufthansa. “Eighteen dollars in New York is nothing,” said the 32-year-old father of three who lives in Queens. He said he wants to earn at least $22 an hour. “People don’t really know what’s going on to get their flights on time,” said Ortiz. “We know what we deserve. We’re not asking that much.” Thousands of these food service workers, currently in contract talks, voted this summer to strike, but airline workers fall under the Railway Labor Act, which requires the permission of the National Mediation Board, whose members are appointed by the president, to do so.
