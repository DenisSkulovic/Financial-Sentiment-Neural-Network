0,Stock Markets Stay Mixed as Airline Stocks Fall | The Motley Fool,Stock Markets Stay Mixed as Airline Stocks Fall. A new record for the Nasdaq shows the divisions within the market..,"   Monday continued a trend we've seen for some time. Even as the Nasdaq Composite moved higher into record territory and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) flirted with all-time highs of its own, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) lost ground. There's still a lot of uncertainty about the future direction of the market, and although certain sectors like technology can be winners regardless of the outcome of the coronavirus crisis and other pressing issues, blue chip stocks in many other industries aren't as fortunate. Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow (0.31%) (86) S&P 500 0.27% 9 Nasdaq Composite 1.00% 110 DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. Nowhere has the lack of knowledge about the long-term impacts of COVID-19 been more evident than in airline stocks. With the industry's entire business model at risk, it's not surprising to see shares of major airlines remain under pressure. That's might be how things stay unless a vaccine becomes available. Airline stocks were lower across the board. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) led the way lower with a more than 5% drop, while United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) was down almost 5%. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) held up better, settling for 3% declines. Smaller carriers fared no better. Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) was down almost 4%, while JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) were off 3%. Even bargain carrier Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) couldn't avoid a 4% drop. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Surprisingly, one source of concern for airlines came not from the U.S. but rather from Europe. Even though the incidence of COVID-19 is much lower in European countries, several countries there took steps to limit travel between countries, imposing new quarantine requirements in an effort to prevent larger outbreaks of the disease. No matter how much a country has coronavirus under control, the threat of a resurgence is always lurking. Even in New Zealand, which went for a month without any new cases from within its borders, a new outbreak in the North Island city of Auckland has led to dramatic reversals of more lenient policies. Similarly, the tourist destination of Iceland has had to return to previous restrictions, including limits on large assemblies of people and mandatory mask wearing in areas where social distancing isn't possible. Nevertheless, airlines are doing whatever they can to try to sustain their operations. United, for instance, launched new routes between the northern part","Aug 17, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/17/stock-markets-stay-mixed-as-airline-stocks-fall/
1,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. Europe provides a reminder there is no easy solution for the issues airlines face..,"   Airline shares were under pressure on Monday as investors grappled with a fresh round of headlines concerning COVID-19 cases spiking. We're moving into the final stages of the summer vacation season with travel demand still anemic, and without much reason to believe it will get better any time soon. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) led the airlines lower, down 5% as of 3:30 p.m. EDT, while shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) were also among the hardest hit in what was a down day for the entire sector. It's been a long, miserable summer for airlines. The pandemic has cut travel demand, leading to second-quarter year-over-year revenue declines of more than 80%. Monday actually brought a glimmer of good news in terms of demand, as more than 862,000 travelers passed through Transportation Security Administration airport checkpoints on Sunday. That's the highest single-day total since mid-March, and a substantial improvement over the 87,534 people screened back on April 14. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. But while a day with 862,000 travelers is an improvement, it is still a far cry from the 2.5 million travelers to pass through security on the same day in 2019. That's a pretty accurate summary of where things stand with the airlines today: Business conditions have improved compared to the mid-spring lows, but we are a long way from normal. On some recent Mondays, the TSA data has been enough to move airlines higher. But investors also had some worrisome reports out of Europe to deal with today, and were in no mood to buy into the sector. European airline stocks fell on Monday after Germany moved to impose a two-week quarantine on travelers coming in from Spain, joining the United Kingdom in taking the step. The moves are sparking fears of a virus resurgence in Europe, which just weeks ago looked to have COVID-19 somewhat under control. Combine Europe's difficulties in containing the virus with an Associated Press story on Monday indicating that U.S. consumers don't feel safe flying, and it seems unlikely we will see a full travel recovery until there is a widespread vaccine. I've been saying for a while now I expect airline stocks to trade largely based on the broader market sentiment concerning COVID-19 and hopes for a vaccine, rather","Aug 17, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/17/why-airline-shares-are-falling-today/

3,"Southwest Airlines Stock Remains a Clear Winner As Travel Recovers; Airline stocks are starting to recover, and LUV stock is one of the best ones out there | MarketScreener",MarketScreener Homepage  >  Equities  >  Nyse  >  Southwest Airlines    LUV. SOUTHWEST,"We may still have a long way to go before the novel coronavirus pandemic is no longer an issue. But, the recovery has already started for hard-hit names like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock. After hitting multi-year lows due to outbreak-driven depressed air traffic, shares have bounced back more than 50%. And that's no surprise. Since mid-May, the airlines have started clawing their way back towards pre-pandemic air traffic levels. Granted, a look at TSA checkpoint travel numbers still shows travel levels remain far blow where they were a year back. However, things are moving in the right direction. And, given public sentiment remains largely pessimistic, coronavirus tailwinds remain more than priced into airline stocks. Yet, if the pandemic cools down sooner than expected, names in the sector stand to make substantial additional gains. And, it's low-cost airlines like LUV stock that stand to gain the most. How so? With a stronger balance sheet than its legacy rivals, Southwest is in a much better place financially. Also, the carrier is projected to recoup a much larger share of its pre-pandemic revenue than the three 'old school' major airlines. To top it all off, the carrier could leverage these strengths to gain substantial market share while rivals struggle to bounce back. In short, Southwest remains one of the best airline stocks out there, and a buy as it makes a recovery. LUV Stock Vs. Legacy Carriers Granted, a sooner-than-expected comeback for air travel bodes well for airline stocks across-the-board. But, there are many reasons why low-cost carriers like Southwest remain airline comeback plays. Firstly, Southwest is in a stronger place financially. Yes, like the other major airlines, this carrier has experienced tremendous cash burn, as well as borrowed billions under the U.S. Government's CARES Act to shore up its balance sheet. Yet, in terms of liquidity, the carrier can outlast many of its rivals. As announced back in June, Southwest has enough cash to carry on for nearly two years. Secondly, this airline is second to only another favorite of mine, Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) in terms of potential recovery speed. What do I mean? As I discussed earlier this month, Spirit and Southwest are the only carriers projected to recover more than 75% of their 2019 revenue in 2021. Compare that to all three legacy carriers. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) all have 2021 revenue projections that","Aug 17, 2020",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SOUTHWEST-AIRLINES-13439/news/Southwest-Airlines-Stock-Remains-a-Clear-Winner-As-Travel-Recovers-Airline-stocks-are-starting-to-r-31131306/

With few travelers taking to the skies, airlines are leveraging their frequent flyer programs more than ever to raise cash. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled openness to a standalone coronavirus relief bill which would provide $25 billion dollars to the airline industry. Former Spirit Airlines CEO Ben Baldanza joins 'Closing Bell' to talk about how this relief bill could help the industry from letting go of more employees. United and the union that represents its pilots have reached an agreement in principle that could avoid the furlough of close to 3,000 pilots. About half of Spirit's more than 2,500 pilots would work fewer hours, a reduction in costs that helps the company avoid involuntary cuts. They are the latest mass job cuts to hit the aviation industry as it reels from a plunge in demand and billions in losses. Thousands of flight attendants are preparing for potential furloughs this fall when the terms of federal aid expire. Airlines and unions are pushing for additional federal aid as a recovery in demand remains remote.

Trace-and-track origin.,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | August 17, 2020 | More on: ABT Everything is wishful thinking for investors hoping to get rich from the rebound of Air Canada soon. The optimism is understandable given the airline’s record of remarkable comebacks. However, the impact of COVID-19 on air travel worldwide is brutal. Passenger demand is nearly non-existent despite decisive actions to keep people safe. Airline stocks are not the best investment choices today. It’s better to look at companies with recognizable growth potentials heading into the near future. Canadian firm Absolute Software (TSX:ABT) in the cybersecurity space is an exciting prospect. Unlike Air Canada, this tech stock has wings to fly in 2020 and beyond. Absolute Software was established in 1993, primarily to curb laptop theft. “LoJack for Laptops” was the original name before it became Computrace. The company is the developer of the theft recovery service for laptops.  You can  install the software in your laptop. It will launch at startup, although undetectable. If the thief goes online, he’s unaware the stolen laptop logs on to the LoJack serve and identifies itself. The software alerts Absolute Software and provides the user’s Internet address. An ISP or enterprise contacts police authorities to pinpoint the thief. You find Absolute’s LoJack on laptops of Dell, HP, and other prominent computer brand names. Absolute Software has evolved to become one of the world’s top cybersecurity companies from a provider of track-and-trace solutions for laptops. This $1 billion company specializes in endpoint security and data risk management solutions. With the massive complexity surrounding enterprise endpoint environments, expect explosive growth. Many companies and organizations have problems relating to enterprise endpoint devices. When the IT and security can’t maintain foundational security hygiene practices, especially the inability to patch critical vulnerabilities, endpoint security defence weakens. Security spending is increasing, but companies are making poor investment decisions. According to Christy Wyatt, President and CEO of Absolute Software, “Increasing security spend annually is not guaranteed to make us more secure.” All IT and security teams need the kind of intelligence that will ensure endpoint controls are functioning effectively and resilient in their respective endpoint environments. Air Canada delivered a total return of 86.86% in 2019 versus Absolute Software’s 16.87% gain. In 2020, it’s a reversal of fortune.

6,"If You’re Worried About DraftKings Stock, You Shouldn’t Buy Airline Stocks | InvestorPlace","If You’re Worried About DraftKings Stock, Don’t Buy the Airliners. DKNG stock continues to be one of my favorites to"," With the Big Ten and Pac-12 postponing fall football, investors are starting to worry that DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) won’t have anything to bet on this fall. With such a noticeable headwind, you would think DraftKings stock would be cratering. But it’s not. Here’s why. On Aug. 14, DKNG stock slipped almost 6%. While there were some troubles during the second quarter, DraftKings reported a generally favorable result. I’m chalking up this decline in its share price to a “buy on rumor, sell on news” kind of deal. As I said in the beginning, investors are getting worried that there won’t be any sports for people to bet on if the football leagues keep postponing games until 2021. There’s a kernel of truth to this idea. However, let’s not forget that baseball, soccer, hockey, golf, and basketball are all running right now. “The Action Network, a sports betting-focused media company, had its biggest week ever for golf and NHL picks last week, and its second-biggest week ever for the NBA,” Axios contributor Kendall Baker wrote Aug. 12. Baker points out that sports betting is currently legal in 23 states if you include the four who’ve passed bills but have yet to implement fully. Another nine states have bills in motion. Further, he reminds his readers that states previously lukewarm on the idea, are jumping on the bandwagon because in-person gambling looks ready to take a reduced role in overall future revenues. “For most major stakeholders in the U.S., sports betting was always a 2023 or 2024 story,” Baker quotes Chris Grove, partner at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming. “So the industry appears to be shrugging off any concern about the long-term impact of COVID-19.” And why not? Eventually, sports and life will get back to normal. By then, sports betting will be legal in a whole bunch of additional states, putting DraftKings in the driver’s seat. DraftKings stock might take it on the chin for the next seven to 10 days. Ultimately, despite facing the same sort of headwinds as airline stocks, it’s not in nearly as much trouble in the near term. Company management says that without sports, it’s burning $15to $20 million a month in cash. Meanwhile, the airlines, which face a much steeper hill to climb, are burning between $5 million and $59 million — a day! At the high end of the daily burn rate is American Airlines","Aug 17, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/draftkings-stock-dkng-better-pick-than-airline-stocks/

10,Ryanair leads collapse in travel stocks on back of flight cut plans,Ryanair leads collapse in travel stocks on back of flight cut plans . Read More. . Revoiced Newsletter. LATEST. Fergus,"Ryanair will cut flight capacity by 20% in September and October. Picture: Niall Carson/PA Wire Ryanair has led a further fall in European airline and tourism shares on the back of it announcing a cut to flight numbers and passenger capacity over the next two months. The airline’s shares – down by over 30% since January – tumbled nearly 8% as it said it would be reducing its flight capacity by 20% during September and October due to forward bookings having “notably weakened” over the past 10 days. The capacity reduction covers a mix of lower passenger allowance and lower flight numbers. However, Ryanair said most of the cuts would result in reduced frequency on certain routes rather than total route closures. It also said that the flight reductions would be “heavily focused” on countries where recent rises in Covid cases have led to increased travel restrictions; such as Spain, France and Sweden. It said Irish routes will be affected too, without giving any firm details on affected routes.  Ryanair has urged the Government to include EU countries with lower or similar Covid case rates to Ireland in its so-called 'green list' of safe destinations, particularly Germany. It said the green list hasn’t worked and testing at airports and effective tracing are the only ways of allowing for safe air travel across the EU. Ryanair said its capacity cuts for the next two months are “unavoidable” and blamed the low level of bookings on the Covid restrictions in a number of EU countries. Airline stocks have suffered greatly since the Covid-19 pandemic hit Europe in the spring. They took a significant hit last Friday after the UK imposed fresh quarantine measures on travellers from France and other countries. In latest trading, all were down again. Aer Lingus and British Airways owner IAG fell more than 5%; EasyJet shed 4.6%, Lufthansa was down nearly 4% and Air France-KLM fell just over 3%.  Lufthansa cabin crew, at the weekend, backed the German carrier's cost-saving plans. Meanwhile, shares in holiday group TUI – which last week secured an extra €1.2bn in credit from Germany’s state development bank, but also raised the need for more funds after suffering heavy losses – tumbled by more than 5%.

13,What’s Buffett Selling? | Morningstar,What’s Buffett Selling?. There were few surprises in wide-moat Berkshire Hathaway's second-quarter 13-F filing. . Want More Actionable Content In,"  There were few surprises in wide-moat Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.B) second-quarter 13-F filing. In fact, having known that the insurer eliminated its stakes in the four major airlines--American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines--as well as Goldman Sachs in early April, while picking up an additional 108 million shares of Bank of America since the start of the third quarter, makes the filing feel a bit dated. That said, there was a fair amount of trimming of, as well as additions to, existing share positions during the quarter, as well as a new-money purchase of Barrick Gold to consider.

Much like the first quarter, Berkshire was a net seller of stocks during the June quarter, reporting $10.9 billion in net proceeds from its purchases and sales in its recent 10-Q. Looking first at the purchases, Berkshire picked up 21 million shares of Barrick Gold for an estimated $470 million, and increased its stakes in Liberty Media SiriusXM, Store Capital, Kroger, and Suncor Energy. It should be noted, though, that each of these holdings accounted for less than 1% (if not less than 0.5%) of Berkshire's $202.4 billion portfolio at the end of the second quarter. As for the sales, the largest was JPMorgan Chase, with Berkshire selling 36 million shares for an estimated $3.3 billion. The company also reduced its stake in Wells Fargo by close to a third, selling 86 million shares for an estimated $2.3 billion. There were also reductions in Berkshire's stakes in Visa and Mastercard, further reducing its commitment to financial services stocks during the quarter. Meanwhile, the sales of the four airline stocks netted the firm an estimated $5.2 billion, while the sales of shares of Charter Communications, Occidental Petroleum, Restaurant Brands, and SiriusXM radio likely brought in another $1 billion.

Has easy online investing created a ticking time bubble?. most popular.,"    Trustworthy, accurate and reliable news stories are more important now than ever. Support our newsrooms by making a contribution. OPINION: Over the last few months, I’ve had many friends ask me if stocks such as Air New Zealand “are good shares to buy right now”. Many of them have never bought shares before. This highlights to me just how real the current retail euphoria in stock markets is. It also prompted me to investigate the impact retail investors are having on markets right now. So, what’s driving this meteoric rise of the retail investor? There are a few factors at play. Pre-Covid-19, share trading by small investors was already percolating. The movement was being stoked by discount broking platforms and the onset of slick investor platforms that facilitate easy online trading. READ MORE:

Quarantine boredom during lockdown combined with the sharp fall in equities created a massive surge in retail investor buying.  Punters were ripe for it with a silent refrain that went something like this: “I can’t go to the casino or get involved in a sports bet with the season on hold, so I’ll have some fun trading the stock market.” The four major US retail brokers reportedly picked up a million new customers over March and April.

16,Will Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Rise 100% by the End of 2020?,. S&P/TSX. S&P 500. DOW. CAD/USD. CRUDE OIL. BTC-CAD. CMC Crypto 200. GOLD FUTURES. RUSSELL 2000. 10-Yr Bond. NASDAQ. VOLATILITY.," Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock can rise 50 times in value. Don’t believe me? Just look at its history. In 2012 shares were under $1. By 2019, they topped $50. A $5,000 investment would have become $250,000! The coronavirus ruined the party. Nearly every airline stock has been slammed, and Air Canada is no exception. Today, the stock trades at $16 at writing. Many investors believe the current valuation is an outright bargain. Even if shares were to double in value, they’d still be 40% below their former highs. Air Canada stock fell 70% in a matter of months. Could a 100% rise occur with such speed, perhaps before the end of 2020? One thing is clear: nothing is clear. Visibility into the future has never been lower for airline operators. Just ask Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu. “This is hundreds of times worse than 9/11, SARS, or the global financial crisis — quite frankly combined,” he said. “We never got to the level when we were only operating at 5% in any of those circumstances, you know, other than the three days of shut-down post 9/11.” He concluded somberly: “This is catastrophic territory.” But as Warren Buffett often advises, sometimes it’s best to buy when others are fearful. Right now, Air Canada is operating at 5% of its typical capacity, which is unprecedented. Even a whiff of a return to normal could send shares soaring. Think about it this way: If traffic is 80% lower next quarter compared to history, Air Canada would quadruple its passenger revenues! Business really can’t get worse. Neither could sentiment. These are exactly the conditions necessary for a quick double. But the ability for a stock to double in price doesn’t necessarily make it a worthwhile investment. What if there’s a 1% chance of doubling, and a 99% chance of bankruptcy? Few would take that bet. To determine the odds of doubling, we first need to determine the odds of absolute failure. Last quarter, Air Canada lost more than $1 billion. The quarter before that, losses also totalled more than $1 billion. With 85% of Canadians preferring travel restrictions to remain in place, and passengers with COVID-19 continuing to enter the country, we should expect another major loss in the coming quarter, possibly throughout the end of the year.

comments  Former Flybe shareholders are preparing legal action over claims they were misled about the airline's performance before it was sold in a cut-price deal last year.  Several dozen retail investors want a judge to decide if former directors put out inaccurate statements and overstated how well the company was doing.  The shareholders' investments were wiped out after they received just 1p per share when it was sold in early 2019 to a group called Connect Airways, which was led by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin.

But the 1p offer was 94 per cent lower than this and left the amount owed to shareholders at just £2.2m, even though the airline raised another £2.8m by selling assets. Flybe had put itself up for sale in late 2018 after running into financial difficulties.  Connect bought Flybe, but the airline eventually went bust this year after the coronavirus crisis hit bookings and the Government refused to hand it a £100m bailout loan.  The former shareholders want to claim compensation and have hired a UK law firm to put together a case to see if they can take ex-directors including then-chairman Simon Laffin and chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener to court.  One investor, who did not wish to be named, lost £350,000 because of the rock-bottom sale price.  The investor said: 'First, the impact this has had on me as an individual is irreversible. Life changing measures have had to be made including having to sell assets etc to survive. Mentally this has also been very challenging.'  Another investor said: 'The use of language, often repeated by the board, to stimulate investment, maximise shareholder value and provide for a stable and positive future for the business, was influential in my decision to invest.'  A spokesman for the law firm said: 'We are exploring the merits of a potential claim by shareholders against the former directors of Flybe for their alleged misconduct and mishandling of the company's affairs. We are analysing the prospects of recovery and whether the board has insurance.
