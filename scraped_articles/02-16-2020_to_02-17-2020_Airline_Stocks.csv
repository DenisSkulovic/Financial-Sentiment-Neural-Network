3,2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now | The Motley Fool,2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now. You'd be hard pressed to find a better investor to emulate than,"   To say that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) are among the most discussed topics in the investment world would be an understatement. The ""Oracle of Omaha"" holds almost a cult following thanks to his remarkable investment prowess throughout his lifetime. With that said, a lot of people probably don't actually take the time to look into all of the holdings that Berkshire Hathaway has. Buffett is very fond of financial-sector companies, and holds a lot of Berkshire Hathaway's capital in bank stocks. The conglomerate also has a massive investment in Apple. However, the two names that I like the most right now are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST). Coca-Cola seems to have revived itself after a few years of troubling revenue trends. Products like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Vanilla Coke, and Cherry Coke have helped the company return to growth. Moreover, moves into energy drinks and coffee have opened up new avenues for growth at Coca-Cola. The beverage giant acquired Costa Coffee last year for $4.9 billion. The coffee chain is based out of the U.K. and has had widespread success. The deal gained Coca-Cola a coffee operation spanning 30 countries.  Coca-Cola finished 2019 with 16% revenue growth in the fourth quarter (7% on an organic basis) and 9% growth for the year. Full-year operating income increased 10%, while full-year earnings increased 38% on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis and 1% on a non-GAAP basis. The company's fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $0.44 per share were enough to meet analysts' estimates, while revenue of $9.07 billion outpaced estimates of $8.89 billion. Coca-Cola attributed its strong sales growth last quarter to new products, including Coke Zero Sugar and Coke Plus Coffee. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Looking ahead, Coca-Cola expects organic revenue growth of 5% in 2020. It also anticipates that adjusted earnings per share will increase 7% to $2.25. Coca-Cola trades for 29 times trailing earnings, based on its full-year 2019 GAAP EPS of $2.07. That's pricey, but I still like the developing picture here. Coffee is a big market, and the company has set itself up to be a bigger part of that story.     Over the last five years, Costco shares have nearly doubled the S&P 500 index's return, soaring 116%. Over the last decade, shares have surged 436% vs. the S&P 500's 214% gain.

4,Singapore Airlines share price: where next after strong Q3? | IG SG,Singapore Airlines share price: where next after strong Q3?. Seize a share opportunity today. Breaking down the earnings by carrier.," What are the latest analyst ratings for Singapore Airlines' shares post Q3 earnings and amid the coronavirus crisis? The Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group saw share price ascend 0.7% on Monday 17 February, after posting solid third quarter results for its 2019/2020 fiscal year last Friday 14 February. Group revenue for the quarter was at a record high of S$4.47billion, which the company attributed to initiatives launched as part of a three-year ‘transformation plan’ first announced in 2017. Operating profit increased 15.7% year-on-year by S$61 million to S$449 million. This translated to a group-wide net profit improvement of S$31 million (+10.9%) to S$315 million. Go long or short on thousands of international stocks. For the nine months ended 31 December 2019, group operating profit rose S$48 million (+5.9%) to $862 million, with net profit up S$40 million. Earnings per share for Q3 also came in at S$0.27 versus S$0.24 a year ago, with no dividends announced for the period. Operating profit for the flagship airline – the eponymous Singapore Airlines – rose S$44 million or 11.9% year-on-year to $413 million. Total revenue was up S$120 million, predominantly due to a 8.2% growth in passenger flown revenue on the back of a 9.7% increase in passenger carriage. Regional arm SilkAir recorded an operating profit of S$7 million, flat against last year. During the quarter, capacity for the carrier fell 8.2%, primarily attributable to the grounding of the 737 MAX 8 fleet as well as the progressive transfer of routes to Scoot. However, traffic fell by a smaller extent of 2.9%, which led to an improvement in passenger load factor of 4.4 percentage points. Low-cost carrier Scoot registered an operating profit of S$4 million for Q3, S$3 million higher than a year ago. Passenger flown revenue increased by 6% or S$26 million, supported by higher passenger traffic of 6.8%. Go long or short on Singapore Airlines and other Singapore blue-chip stocks with an IG account today. The group acknowledged in its financial results release that the growing scale of the COVID-19 outbreak presents ‘significant challenges’ to the business. It revealed that demand for services to Mainland China has been severely affected. The flagship airline and SilkAir have drastically reduced frequencies on all Mainland China routes for February and March 2020, while Scoot has suspended all flights to Mainland China until 28 March 2020 (end of the Northern Winter 2019/20 operating season).

The stock slipped to as low as $314.88 on Feb. 3 and then rebounded to as high as $349.95 on Feb. 12. This high is between its weekly value level at $333.34 and its annual risky level at $351.32. The stock set a cycle low of $292.47 on Dec. 26, 2018, in between the two 737 MAX crashes. Recent news keeps delaying the return to the skies for this airplane. We know the issues that surfaced for the MAX go back to early 2016 but were not disclosed until after the crashes. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 is extremely important as it accounted for 60% of the company's revenue in 2018. Boeing still faces a host of legal, political, and regulatory concerns that should limit the upside for the stock. After graduating from Georgia Tech as an industrial engineer, I worked in the aerospace industry at Grumman on Long Island 1966 through 1970. I was involved with standards and procedures on the manufacturing floor where aircraft for the Navy were being built. Back then, it was all about quality control as we worked to put a man on the moon and win the F-14 Tom Cat contract. Boeing has been negligent on airline production not only for the Boeing MAX 8 but also for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner built in Charleston, South Carolina. Quality control is the key, but at Boeing, workers seem to have been forced to increase production, ignoring concerns by the engineers and workers on the production lines. The Charleston South Carolina, plant that makes the 787 Dreamliner has had employee complaints that manufacturing standards are unsafe. Boeing has reduced production for this model due to the trade war with China and now the coronavirus. In January, Boeing did not have a single order for any of its models of aircraft.

6,Which Airlines Are Suffering The Most From Coronavirus? - Simple Flying,Which Airlines Are Suffering The Most From Coronavirus?. Capacity Exposure. Deep dive on Finnair. Karol Ciesluk. Related Articles:. Daily Aviation," We have been reporting continuously on the numerous airlines suspending their operations to China since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. Recently the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) estimated that the entire outbreak could cost the industry around US$5bn. However, that $5bn won’t be equally spread among the airlines. Some airlines will invariably feel the impact more than others. The biggest impact will be definitely felt by the Chinese carriers as well as other airlines in East Asia. However, predicting the exact impact on individual airlines can be very difficult due to the lack of revenue data coming from the Chinese market. We do know that carriers such as China Southern, China Eastern, and Air China offer dozens of destinations from Wuhan. These routes would clearly be most affected by the outbreak. Outside of China, in the East Asian region, the impact will be felt no less than in China itself. The tourism impacts of reduced Chinese travel puts $1bn in revenue at risk for both Japan and Thailand. According to data from OAG Aviation worldwide, the airlines with the most significant capacity exposed to China are Air Macau, Cathay Dragon, and Thai Lion Air. All with close to 60% capacity exposure to the Chinese market. Air China which holds a major stake in Air Macau is also affected. Furthermore, Air Asia X, Thai AirAsia, and Asiana Airlines have roughly 30% of their capacity exposed to the Chinese market. Airlines such as Scoot, All Nippon Airways, and Korean Air sit closer to 20%. With Air Asia and its numerous subsidiaries and partner airlines affected, has seen its stock price fall by approximately 30% since the beginning of the outbreak. In the United States, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines are the main carriers likely to be most impacted by the virus. However, the Chinese market accounts for less than 5% of capacity for both. European Airlines have varying exposure to the Chinese market. Lufthansa is sits at the top with 73 connections to Mainland China per week. It may seem substantial but it only accounts for less than 3% of the total capacity for the German Airline. The Finnish airline is known for its focus on the Asian market. In fact, it operates 21 flights to Asia. Six of these flights are to China.

More From View","by Gary Leff on February 17, 2020 Barry Michaels has been trying to start an airline for at least 28 years. First under the name Family Airlines, and then Avatar Airlines, he’s had an idea to fly Boeing 747s between leisure destinations. He went to prison for tax and securities fraud in connection with the venture. The DOT insisted at the time that he give up control of the project. He’s kept trying, and kept failing, for three decades. He’s even claimed no longer to be involved with the airline (even as he represents himself as running it). Last year he appointed someone else as CEO trying to gain traction. However in his latest press release he’s back as CEO and he’s announcing:       If you want a good laugh here’s a copy of Avatar Airlines letter of intent sent to Boeing. I guess Michaels’ plan to acquire 747s through social media didn’t work out.  If Avatar ever gets money – and uses that money to start an airline – the plan they laid out would be to build their 747 route network:  The idea was to squeeze 581 passengers into a 747 in order to produce low seat costs. That’s great if you can fill the plane, but an empty 747 has very high per passenger costs. First flight of the morning on Tuesday and Wednesday from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and Saturday early morning Vegas to Albuquerque aren’t likely to be winners. Their secret sauce was going to be advertising, selling sponsorships to cover free wifi and make a profit painting planes in Coca Cola, Burger King, and Red Bull branded livery. The overhead bins will advertise men’s grooming. And they promise starting pay for captains is $275,000.  Michaels by the way ran as an independent candidate for US Senate from Nevada.  When it didn’t work out he shopped around his vanity license plate – and his car.  What will he sell if this venture doesn’t work out again?

8,"Should Investors Buy, Sell, or Hold Aurora (TSX:ACB) Stock? - The Motley Fool Canada",". . . . . . . . Should Investors Buy, Sell, or Hold Aurora (TSX:ACB) Stock?. A second green","      Victoria Hetherington | February 16, 2020 | More on: ACB APHA ACB APHA There was a mini cannabis rally heading into the weekend, with popular stocks such as Canopy Growth, Cronos Group, OrganiGram Holdings, and Aurora (TSX:ACB)(NYSE:ACB) up by single digits Friday. The Aurora bounce was deceptive, however, suggesting short- seller washout rather than a genuine rally. With a target price now at half of its current valuation, the consensus is that this is an overvalued “sell” at $2 a share at writing. Investors may not wish to buy even at $1, however. Before even considering Aurora, even as a de facto penny stock, investors will need to see fast, creative downsizing. The knife could still fall further for Aurora, and a bearish reading sees the stock unlikely to either bounce back or even benefit from being bought out, as a takeover is unlikely. While it’s still overvalued, the consensus says “sell” for now and watch the market. Investors who got burned by the optimism of the new sector but still want to pack some pot in a portfolio may want to wait for the bottom. Arguably, the market isn’t there yet, though by some analyses it looks that way. With so many impactful yet unknowable variables floating around – the eventual retail landscape not only in Canada, but also in the U.S. — the durability of the black and grey markets, the balance sheets of some of the biggest players – the bottom could be bankruptcy. While much of the steep gains of the sector have fizzled out, Aphria (TSX:APHA)(NYSE:APHA), with its European licences, key German exposure, encouraging sales track record, and the ability to bring down overheads, make for a stock on the mend. While its overall performance was negative this week, it has by no means underperformed the worst offenders. Going forwards, Aphria is a plausible contender for upside. Momentum hasn’t entirely left the cannabis space – it’s just become increasingly event-driven and pessimistic. ETFs can offer an insight into how the sector is performing, but only the most optimistic of cannabis investors would try indexing this space. As performance indicators, these kinds of pot funds have merit, but as a long-term thesis, the legal cannabis industry lacks the transparency or stability to support them as investments.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Robin Wigglesworth in Oslo Goldman Sachs and a research boutique have constructed a “synthetic” way for investors to bet more cheaply against Chinese stocks. China’s equity market is one of the biggest in the world, with the main CSI 300 index boasting an overall market capitalisation of $4.5tn. But “shorting”, or taking negative bets on the stocks, is tricky, as the costs and regulations involved are too onerous. Quant Insight, a London-based research group, has therefore built a basket of about 40 US stocks with Chinese exposure designed to closely mirror the performance of China’s CSI 300 benchmark. Goldman Sachs has added the index to Marquee, its digital platform, which means it can sell clients derivatives known as total return swaps based on the basket. “It’s a very interesting product,” said Raheel Siddiqui, global macro strategist at Neuberger Berman. “We don’t necessarily want to short China right now, but if we did this is something we could use . . . sometimes it’s easier to play macro themes through equity baskets.” Mahmood Noorani, the head of Quant Insight, estimates that the cost of borrowing Chinese stocks for short selling can come to more than 10 per cent of the equities’ value annually, compared with about 2 per cent by using the custom basket. “Chinese equities are eye-wateringly expensive to short directly,” Mr Noorani said. “This addresses a clear pain point for global investors.” Investors often want to make more refined bets, while banks can collect fees for building more bespoke investment products. For example, if a hedge fund wants to bet purely on the Spanish economic recovery but avoid the Madrid stock market’s heavy Latin American exposure, they could use synthetic, customised products to do so. Investor attention on Chinese equities has been on the rise, both because of their increasing importance and integration into global indices and because of the outbreak of the coronavirus, which has weighed heavily on Chinese stocks in recent weeks. The CSI 300 has fallen about 5 per cent since its January peak. “The virus will probably result in a big hit to China’s economy in the first quarter, and the longer it goes on, the more likely it is to have knock-on effects to the global supply chain,” said Evan Brown, head of multi-asset strategy at UBS Asset Management. Asset managers have long lobbied for Beijing to make it easier to","Feb 16, 2020",https://www.ft.com/content/a862ddf8-4f1f-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5

With so much controversy surrounding the company, does Boeing stock have a chance of recovering? By: Valerie Medleva | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. For years, Boeing (NYSE: BA) was one of the most respected American industrial and defense companies. Those days are long gone. Last year, the business found itself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Its Boeing 737 MAX made more headlines than it had flights. The company’s once rock-solid image got destroyed, with investors running for the exit. Can Boeing stock get away with this mess? Founded over a century ago, Boeing had been on a long and fairly steady upward trend. This was reflected in its share price: After falling from $107.83 to $29.05 during the Great Recession, the BA share price has soared in value. In January 2017, Boeing broke through the $158 resistance level. Following the Lion Air crash in October 2018, BA dipped once again only to reach new highs in the first two months of 2019. The stock hit a record high of $446.01 on March 1 of that year. The company reported mind-boggling results for its Q4 of 2018. Its earnings of $5.48 per share smashed analysts’ estimates of $4.57.  Moreover, the company brought in $101.1 billion in annual revenue — the first time it has ever gone above a $100 billion mark. Boeing delivered 806 aircraft and expected to break that record in 2019.

11,3 ASX dividend shares to buy in 2020,. . . . . . . . . 3 ASX dividend shares to buy in 2020. 1. Harvey Norman,"      Ken Hall | February 16, 2020 11:34am | More on: HVN NAB QAN WBC ASX 200 If you’re into ASX dividend shares, you might be wondering where the value is at right now. The S&P/ASX 200 Index (INDEXASX: XJO) is near all-time highs and climbing higher in 2020. In the midst of a busy February, here are 3 ASX dividend shares that I think could be in the buy zone right now.  The Harvey Norman share price is one of those ASX dividend shares that also offers capital growth. Shares in the Aussie retailer have surged 34.41% in the last 12 months to $4.57 at the time of writing. I like Harvey Norman because it is still yielding 7.16% despite the strong recent gains. There are signs of weakness in the Aussie retail sector but so far, Harvey Norman has ridden the storm. NAB shares have been under pressure in recent years alongside its other Big Four peers. However, NAB is also yielding 6.44% right now and could be the pick of the ASX banks. The Aussie bank is among my top ASX dividend shares and could have some further capital upside. In terms of pure yield, Westpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC) shares offer more (6.97%) but I think the AUSTRAC scandal is worth steering clear of. I think NAB or Macquarie Group Ltd (ASX: MQG) are worth keeping an eye on in 2020. Qantas shares are currently yielding 3.89% at the time of writing and could be in the buy basket. I’ll be waiting for the airline’s results on 20 February to see how the financial position is looking. Qantas has significant hedging activities that could be beneficial in 2020 if oil prices are volatile. Qantas looks like one of the top ASX dividend shares right now and its shares are up 19.11% since early June. If you’re happy with exposure to the airlines, now could be a good time to buy. The Qantas share price has edged lower on coronavirus concerns but the long-term investment fundamentals still look good to me.
