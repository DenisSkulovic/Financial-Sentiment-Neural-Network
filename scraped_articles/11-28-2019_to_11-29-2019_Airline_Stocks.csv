0,Three stocks to watch that have missed the record rally,"These stocks haven’t participated in the record rally, but three of them could still turn. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News","Call them the market’s turkeys. As the major averages make yet another set of closing highs heading into Thanksgiving Day, some high-profile stocks have been sitting out the record-hitting run since October. While the S&P 500 has rallied more than 9% since the Oct. 3 bottom, shares of Twitter, Dollar Tree, Western Digital, Molson Coors, McDonald’s and eBay have had trouble catching up. In fact, most have fallen substantially. Since Oct. 3, Twitter has dropped nearly 21.5%; Dollar Tree has fallen almost 18%; Western Digital has lost over 11%; Molson Coors has tumbled nearly 11%; eBay has shed about 6%; and McDonald’s is down almost 5%, as of Wednesday’s close. But some of these names are set up well for a near-term push higher, says Craig Johnson, senior technical research analyst and managing director at Piper Jaffray. “I’d pardon two turkeys here ahead of Thanksgiving,” he said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “The first one would be Western Digital.”  “The shares are definitely well off of their 52-week highs, but you’re pulling right back to support at around [$]47 and change,” Johnson said, referencing the stock’s one-year chart. “From my perspective, given the fact that we’ve found good support and we’re starting to see momentum indicators starting to improve, that would be one that I’d be buying here,” the analyst said. Johnson’s second pardoned turkey? Twitter. “This stock has gapped down,” Johnson said, pointing to the one-year chart and the stock’s nearly 32% drop from its 52-week highs. “It’s now starting to improve on the chart itself, but, also, it’s starting to show improvement on the momentum indicators.”  “From my perspective, closing that big gap down that we had seen just a few months ago is certainly going to be a nice move here in the stock, and it’s one that we would be buying down here,” Johnson said. Twitter also found a fan in Michael Binger, president of independent money management firm Gradient Investments. For investors who can “put all the noise” around Twitter behind them, particularly negative headlines and developments in social media regulation, the stock may provide a good opportunity for gains, Binger said in the same “Trading Nation” interview. “When you look underneath the covers of Twitter, what you see is a company next year that’s going to grow its revenue 15%, it’s going to grow its [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,","Nov 28, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/28/three-stocks-to-watch-that-have-missed-the-record-rally.html
1,Holidays spark demand for retail stocks: Oppenheimer's Alon Rosin,"From malls to Wall Street, Oppenheimer’s Alon Rosin finds holidays are sparking retail stock boom. The Best Buy trade. MORE","It appears the Black Friday deals aren’t just at your favorite mall. Oppenheimer’s Alon Rosin suggests the holiday rush is alive on Wall Street, too. He’s seeing investors take positions in retail stocks at a robust pace right now. “We’ve seen a lot of positive flows in XRT, the retail ETF, Best Buy and select retail names,” the firm’s head of institutional equity derivatives told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Wednesday. “They’ve gone up anywhere between 3 to 10 percent on average this past week relative to the S&P [500] which is up a percent. So, we’ve seen a lot of outperformance and positioning positively ahead of this weekend.” Rosin doesn’t see a coincidence in the intersection of interest in retail stocks and the Black Friday start of the holiday season. “If you have conversations with consumers at work, at home — everybody has been waiting for Thanksgiving to make their deals: Cyber Monday, this weekend,” he said. Rosin, who has been bullish on the overall market, sees Best Buy as one of the market’s most promising retail names. Shares of the electronics giant have surged more than 52% this year. In its best month, the stock is up more than 10%. “Best Buy has been a good name. They’re coming after Amazon,” said Rosin. “There’s a lot of positivity around how they’re attracting new consumers on their one-day delivery. But Rosin, who does not hold a position in Best Buy, Amazon or the XRT, recommends shorting the stock right now due to the strong bounce. “The stock has had a move here, and if you’re long it, we actually don’t mind buying a put to hedge that long position,” Rosin said.

4,6 Successful Companies That Are Employee-owned,6 Successful Companies That Are Employee-Owned. Publix Super Markets tops the list of employee-owned companies. Why Employee-Owned Companies Are Successful.,"In a given year, disengagement in the workplace can cost American businesses as much as $500 billion.1﻿ This is why many companies have put a lot of effort into keeping their staff motivated. They have done this by not only paying their workers competitive wages but also giving them an actual ownership interest in the business that they work for. One of the most popular ways to structure an employee-owned company is through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). As an article published by the Employee Ownership Foundation explains, ""Employee-owners have a different attitude about their company, their job, and their responsibilities that make them work more effectively and increases the likelihood that their company will be successful. Fundamentally, employee-owners are more accountable for their job performance and their fellow workers' job performance simply because they have a common stake in the success of their company."" An ESOP is usually a trust fund set up by an employer that owns shares in the business for the benefit of its employees.2﻿ Below, we will take a look at six companies that are significantly owned by their past and present employees. With 1,242 store locations and more than 200,000 employees, Publix Super Markets is the country's largest employee-owned company.3﻿ 4﻿ In 2019, Publix reported retail sales of more than $38.1 billion as well as a net profit of $3 billion.5﻿ This makes the company the eighth-largest privately held company in the United States in 2019, according to Forbes Magazine.6 Founded in 1930 by George W. Jenkins, the company slowly grew into the most profitable supermarket chain in the nation. All Publix workers, regardless of their position in the company, receive company stock after they have been with the company for more than 12 months.7﻿ In its 2020 list of the ""100 Best Companies to Work For,"" Fortune magazine ranked Publix number 38.8 Penmac Staffing is a temp agency that helps connect job seekers with employers. The company was founded in 1988 in Springfield, Missouri by Patti Penny, who originally started the company with the goal of finding temporary employees for the company that employed her husband. Over the years, the company grew from a single small office to 32 branch offices located in eight states. They now serve over 1,200 business clients.9﻿ According to the National Center for Employee Ownership (NCEO), Penmac is the country's second-largest employee-owned company with 27,850 employees as","Nov 29, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/051316/6-successful-companies-are-employeeowned.asp
5,Losses mount for Tata Group's aviation ventures - The Financial Express,Losses mount for Tata Group’s aviation ventures. The previous financial year was tough for most domestic carriers as yields were,"Losses are mounting at the airline firms of the Tata Group – AirAsia India and Vistara. While Vistara’s losses in financial year 2018-19 nearly doubled to Rs 830 crore compared to the previous year, AirAsia’s losses quadrupled to over `670 crore in the same period. Tata Sons holds 51% stake in both airlines. Both have incurred losses through the past four financial years. In FY19, AirAsia’s other expenses saw a 70% y-o-y increase to Rs 2,830.62 crore. The airline’s liabilities went up 84% y-o-y to Rs 1,537.07 crore during the year, on account of its trade payable more than doubling to `827.8 crore. The airline saw a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of Rs 103.67 crore in FY19 against a net increase of Rs 93.47 crore in FY18. The Tata Group infused over Rs 307 crore capital into AirAsia in FY19, according to data sourced from the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). Tata Sons also bought 2% stake from two other shareholders, taking the company’s total holding in the airline to 51% in FY19.
The company’s auditors last year had also expressed “material uncertainty about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” according to financials filed by the company with the MCA. Vistara’s losses in FY19 were primarily on account of 48.3% y-o-y increase in other expenses to Rs 3,436.31 crore. The airline’s finance costs more than doubled y-o-y to Rs 19.01 crore. The full-service carrier’s liabilities rose 41.5% y-o-y to Rs 1,123.96 crore, of which trade payables consisted of `302.73 crore, up 50% y-o-y. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents during FY19 stood at `204.63 crore, down 23.4% y-o-y. Total capital infusion into Vistara during FY19 stood at Rs 2,200 crore, of which Tata Sons, along with nominees, infused `1,122 crore. One of the challenges for Vistara, a joint venture between the Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, is that the full-service model has been a challenge, said analysts. “The full-service model is something which has not really worked out very well in the Indian context. Jet Airways failed miserably. Air India, which is also a full-service carrier, continues to be under huge stress. In full-service carriers, the cost structure is very high; so invariably you see them struggling compared with low-cost carriers. That’s another reason why losses have continued for Vistara,” an analyst from a domestic brokerage said. However, Leslie Thng, CEO, Vistara, said","Nov 28, 2019",https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/losses-mount-for-tata-groups-aviation-ventures/1777767/

(ATH:AEGN), Eftichios Vassilakis, Just Bought 1.7% More Shares. Aegean Airlines Insider Transactions Over","Potential Aegean Airlines S.A. (ATH:AEGN) shareholders may wish to note that the Executive Chairman, Eftichios Vassilakis, recently bought €123k worth of stock, paying €8.19 for each share. While that's a very decent purchase to our minds, it was proportionally a bit modest, boosting their holding by just 1.7%. Check out our latest analysis for Aegean Airlines In fact, the recent purchase by Eftichios Vassilakis was the biggest purchase of Aegean Airlines shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That implies that an insider found the current price of €8.30 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for Aegean Airlines share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price. Eftichios Vassilakis was the only individual insider to buy over the year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them). Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 6.4% of Aegean Airlines shares, worth about €38m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders. It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Insiders likely see value in Aegean Airlines shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company).

7,Decade in Review: 2010s Was the Decade of the Bull | Stock Market News | US News,Decade in Review: The Decade of the Bull. The 2010s will always be remembered by investors for the longest bull,"MONEY                 The current bull market turns 129 months old in December. (GETTY IMAGES) REMEMBER THE BEGINNING of 2010? Investors had endured a painful previous 10 years. Indeed, the “aughts” was the worst decade for the stock market since the infamous, Great Depression-plauged 1930s. RELATED CONTENT How to Build an Investment Portfolio Thankfully, the coming 10 years would be markedly different. As is so often the case in the boom and bust cycle, the worst of times were followed immediately thereafter by some of the best. From a market's perspective, the 2010s will forever be remembered as an era of slow but steady gains on Wall Street, and a period of sustained growth for investors and their retirement accounts. Characterized more by incremental progress than explosive growth, the 10 years from 2010 to 2019 also saw a remarkable lack of volatility, with few setbacks. Today, the uninterrupted march higher that defined the 2010s is all the more remarkable in the context of history. Since 1926, there have been 13 bull markets – periods of time where stocks are rising without a 20% decline. On average, they endured for 53 months. SEE: The current bull market, which began in March 2009, turns 129 months old in December. The next-longest uninterrupted rally began in 1990, and lasted for 113 months. It ended with the bursting of the dot-com bubble. But why did the current record-setting bull-market occur in the first place? What made the 2010s so notable, and how was the rally sustained? Individual stocks don’t always trade for rational prices. Nor do the broader markets. But a decade-long rally doesn’t happen on a whim. The bull market of the 2010s resulted from a special mix of factors: A depressed base. One meaningful contributor to the decade’s rally was merely the miserable performance of the 2000-2009 period, which helped to drive prices low enough for a solid rally to ensue, should things just return to normal. In fact, the 2000-2009 decade suffered two separate recessions and accompanying bear markets. The worst, of course, was the disastrous 2008-2009 financial crisis; the S&P 500 fell 57% in 17 months. Sometimes called “The Lost Decade,” the S&P finished the decade lower than it began – a full 24% lower, in fact.

Ahead of post-Thanksgiving Black Friday, stocks of major retailers like Walmart, Target, and Costco are up nearly 50% this year, on average. By: Joseph Young | Email | Leave a comment Black Friday is set to begin in a few hours and ahead of the post-Thanksgiving celebration, stocks of major retailers like Walmart, Target, and Costco are up nearly 50% year-to-date. Since January 1, 2019, Walmart, Target, and Costco stocks surged by 27%, 90%, and 54.4% respectively, by 54.4% on average. The strong rally of the three retail stocks indicate a significant rise in consumer spending, possibly fueled by the tax cuts in the U.S., progress in the U.S.-China trade deal, and the bull market of U.S. stocks. Some states like Florida are already expecting record-high sales based on data from the Florida Retail Federation. Consumers are anticipated to spend 4% more compared to last year, further raising the demand for Black Friday. According to the National Retail Federation president and CEO Matthew Shay, consumer demand remains strong as the U.S. economy continues to expand. The expectations of the U.S. stock market to maintain its momentum throughout the year’s end is likely to provide retailers like Walmart, Target, and Costco with an active holiday season including Black Friday and Christmas. Shay said: The U.S. economy is continuing to grow and consumer spending is still the primary engine behind that growth.

The Dow Jones fell on Friday as rising tensions between Trump and China raised the risk of December tariffs ruining Christmas for the Dow. By: Francois Aure | Email | Leave a comment The Dow Jones fell more than 100 points on Friday after Donald Trump signed a bill supporting the Hong Kong protestors, prompting a sharp response from the Chinese government. Stock markets rallied slightly off their lows, as signs of a strong Black Friday showing helped to pump Dow retail stocks like Walmart. All three of the major US stock market indices fell at least 0.4%, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 all priced in the fact that Trump and Xi’s relationship was souring due to the Hong Kong bill. The Dow closed at 28,051.41 for a loss of 112.59 points or 0.4%. The S&P 500 slid 0.4% in lockstep with the DJIA, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.46%. Confirming the move from risk, the price of crude oil plummeted 4.5%, while the price of gold rallied 0.65%. Helping to lift general risk appetite, better than expected unemployment numbers in eurozone powerhouse Germany continued to raise confidence that the European economy might be bottoming out. Things could have been much worse for the Dow if this critical German data had not cushioned the blow.

Jet Airways | Jet Airways crisis | Naresh Goyal Subrata Panda  |  Mumbai 
Last Updated at November 28, 2019 00:25 IST The committee of creditors (CoC) of the beleaguered Jet Airways has decided to file an application before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for extending the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of the company by 90 days. Under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the CIRP period can be extended by 90 days from the stipulated 180 days if there is a chance of resolution of the firm. The 180-day timeline of Jet ends on December 16. In a filing to the stock exchanges, the company said lenders in the fifth CoC meeting passed resolutions to extend the last day for submission of a resolution plan by the South America-based Synergy Group to December 16 and filed an application in the NCLT to extend the CIRP period. Synergy Group was earlier given time till November 15 to file a resolution plan but it asked for more time to submit bid for the company, as it sought more clarity on airport slots in India and London. Synergy Group is the only interested entity shortlisted by the Resolution Professional's team to file a plan for the defunct airlines. In its last hearing in the NCLT, the tribunal asked Synergy Group to appear before the Bench and wanted to know if the firm was at all serious about reviving the defunct airlines.
