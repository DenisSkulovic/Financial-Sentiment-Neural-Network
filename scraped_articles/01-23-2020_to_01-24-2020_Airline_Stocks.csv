Related","U.S. airline carriers are under pressure this week in reaction to a triple whammy of mixed earnings, coronavirus fears, and The Boeing Company's (BA) latest rollback in the re-certification of the 737-MAX jetliner. This bearish brew wasn't expected after Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) kicked off the sector's earnings season on a high note last week, beating fourth quarter profit estimates and reporting healthy revenue growth. Delta and its peers sold off after initial reports from China raised fears that travelers will stay home in 2020 rather than risk coronavirus exposure through infected parties. Investors then ignored a positive Tuesday report from United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL), triggering a reversal that has dropped the stock to a four-month low. Adding to downside pressure, long-term laggard American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) reported another weak quarter, missing profit estimates while barely meeting revenue expectations. This decline could mark a major turning point for the sector, which has failed to break out with the Dow Jones Transportation Average in the past two years. These are cyclical issues, highly sensitive to an economic expansion that has now entered a second decade, making it the longest growth spurt in American history. Everyone knows that good times won't last forever, and the run-up to the 2020 election could signal a major turning point in that cycle. United Airlines came public in its current incarnation in 2006, carving a trading range between $30 and $50 into a 2008 breakdown that posted an all-time low at $2.80 in July, well ahead of the October crash. It tested new support for more than a year and turned higher into the new decade, finally stalling in 2011 under the IPO opening print in the mid-$30s. A 2013 breakout completed a round trip into the 2007 high at $51.57 in 2014, but the rally topped out a few months later, generating a resistance level that is still exerting some influence. Price action carved two higher highs into the December 2018 peak at $97.85 and eased into a trading range that has flip-flopped through equal-sized rallies and sell-offs for more than a year. The stock is now trading at a level first reached in May 2017, telling us that frustrated shareholders have missed a big chunk of the secular bull market. Amazingly, that hasn't affected the stock's accumulation readings, which are hovering near new highs.

1,Stocks Fall as Second Virus Case in U.S. Spooks Investors - The New York Times,Stocks Fall as Second Virus Case in U.S. Spooks Investors. Site Index. Site Information Navigation,"ADVERTISEMENT  Airline stocks, exposed to the impact of travel restrictions related to China’s coronavirus outbreak, were hard hit. By Matt Phillips Stocks in the United States suffered their worst decline since early October, amid concern that a dangerous new virus could hurt the global economy. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite index both dropped 0.9 percent on Friday. The declines picked up steam after officials said a second case of the virus, the coronavirus, had been diagnosed in the United States. The patient, a woman in her 60s in Chicago, had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak. Earlier Friday, the Chinese authorities broadened a travel lockdown in central China to 12 cities near Wuhan. The orders effectively pen in 35 million residents to try to contain the virus, which had led to at least 41 deaths by Friday evening and more than 1,000 infections worldwide. Airline shares — exposed to the impact of travel restrictions related to the virus — dropped sharply, American Airlines by 4 percent and United Airlines by 3.5 percent. ADVERTISEMENT The news also battered shares of companies with significant exposure to the Chinese market. Shares of the casino company Wynn Resorts, which is heavily reliant on revenue from Chinese gamblers in Macau, fell more than 3 percent. Commodities markets also reflected a downbeat view of the outlook for global growth on Friday, with prices for oil and copper falling. Energy and materials stocks also slumped during Friday’s trading session. Chevron fell more than 1 percent, while Exxon Mobil dropped 0.7 percent. Financial shares faltered after some regional banks reported lackluster demand for commercial lending in recent days. Huntington Bancshares fell 3.8 percent, while KeyCorp and Regions Financial both fell more than 2.5 percent. JPMorgan Chase fell 2.5 percent. The stumble in financial stocks mirrored a sharp drop in bond yields, which serve as the foundation for commercial lending rates and can have an impact on the profitability of loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.68 percent. ADVERTISEMENT Updates on the spreading virus overshadowed bright spots for investors throughout the day. Surveys of activity in the American manufacturing and services sectors both showed growth in January. And on Thursday, after the close of trading, Intel announced better-than-expected profit and sales results for the fourth quarter, citing strong growth in sales of chips for data","Jan 24, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/business/stock-market-today.html

Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of legendary holding company","Getty Images Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of legendary holding company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), is often called the greatest value investor of all time. Although Buffett identifies targets based on their ""intrinsic value,"" a number of Berkshire's holdings look like cheap stocks by more prosaic value indicators, too. Not every stock held by Berkshire Hathaway is necessarily a bargain at its current share price. After all, Buffett has held some of these names for decades. To that end, we scoured Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio of nearly 50 stocks to find the ones that look like they're on sale these days. In some cases, we relied on forward price-to-earnings multiples, which show what a stock costs in light of its expected earnings growth. (The S&P 500, by the way, trades at 18.6 times expected earnings, by Yardeni Research's calculations.) In others, we also took into consideration book values. And naturally we paid attention to long-term growth forecasts and fundamentals. After sorting through the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio with those criteria in mind, these 10 names stood out among the cheapest Warren Buffett stocks. 1 of 10 Getty Images Amazingly, shares in Apple have more than tripled since early 2016, but they still look like a bargain. Sure, AAPL stock goes for more than 24 times expected earnings -- more than the S&P 500's 18.6. But the company is forecast to deliver average annual earnings growth of 11.5%. The S&P 500 is expected to increase adjusted earnings at a rate in the single digits. Apple accounts for more than a quarter of the total value of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. And unlike many of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, Buffett has been happy to discuss his ardor for AAPL. As he has said more than once on CNBC, he loves the power of Apple's brand and its ecosystem of products (such as the iPhone and iPad) and services (such as Apple Pay and iTunes). ""I do not focus on the sales in the next quarter or the next year,"" Buffett has said. ""I focus on the ... hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people who practically live their lives by (the iPhone)."" 2 of 10 Getty Images Buffett likes to say this his preferred holding period is ""forever.""

BTC-USD.,"                                                   Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV) has been mostly grounded in the past year, gaining just 7%. However, the Wuhan coronavirus has investors worried about the near-term outlook for international travel, and large option traders appear to be betting on domestic U.S. airline Southwest over its international airline peers. The Trades On Thursday, Benzinga Pro subscribers received nine option alerts related to unusually large trades of airline options. Here are a handful of the biggest: At 9:36 a.m., a trader sold 500 American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) put options with a $27 strike price expiring on Feb. 21 near the bid price at $1.604. The trade represented an $80,200 bullish bet. At 10:30 a.m., a trader bought 1,100 Southwest call options with a $55 strike price expiring on Friday near the ask price at 30 cents. The trade represented a $33,000 bullish bet. At 11:33 a.m., a trader sold 756 American Airlines call options with a $40 strike price expiring in January 2021 near the bid price at 60 cents. The trade represented a $45,360 bearish bet. Of the nine total large airline option trades on Thursday morning, three were calls were purchased at or near the ask or puts sold at or near the bid, trades typically seen as bullish. Four trades were calls sold at the near the bid or puts purchases at or near the ask, trades typically seen as bearish. The two largest trades of the morning were executed near the bid-ask spread midpoint, trades typically considered neutral. Why It's Important Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader. Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.

9,Where Is JetBlue Airways Headed in 2020? | The Motley Fool,Where Is JetBlue Airways Headed in 2020?. Can the worst-performing major U.S. airline turn it around in 2020?. Challenges for,"   The smallest of the six major U.S. airlines by market capitalization,JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), is a discount airline that covers North America, Central America, and South America. Unfortunately for JetBlue, its stock was the worst-performing of the major airlines last decade. However, the stock was still able to climb more than the S&P 500. Lacking a dividend, is JetBlue worth considering or is there a better case to be made for other airline stocks?  JBLU DATA BY YCHARTS Similar to the second smallest major U.S. airline by market capitalization, Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue has coverage throughout major cities in the U.S. but also specializes in a particular region. For JetBlue, that region is Latin America, specifically the Caribbean. During its third-quarter 2019 conference call, CFO Stephen Priest notes revenue challenges in JetBlue's Latin America/Caribbean region, contributing to revenue growth of just 4% year over year.  For a while now, JetBlue has been struggling with revenue growth, and that struggle looks to continue. The company's COO, Joanna Geraghty, ""expects low-single-digit RASM growth for 2020."" RASM, or revenue per available seat mile, is a key revenue metric for airlines. Although in line with guidance, RASM declined 0.9% year over year in Q3 2019 and is expected to fall 0.5% to 3.5% year over year for Q4 2019, which the company will report Jan. 23.   IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. JetBlue's anticipated revenue declines come despite capacity increases that are forecasted to be between 4.5% and 6.5% in Q4 2019, resulting in an impressive total 2019 increase of 6% to 7%.  Also on the positive side, JetBlue's fleet is predominately Airbus and Embraer aircraft, meaning it isn't as impacted by the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX scandal as rivals Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and United Airlines. JetBlue is the only major U.S. airline that doesn't operate Boeing planes in its fleet, meaning JetBlue should have no problem filling its expected 15 Airbus orders for 2020.  JBLU PRICE TO FREE CASH FLOW DATA BY YCHARTS Another positive is JetBlue's earnings forecast, which is $2.50 to $3 for 2020. At a current price of around $18.70 per share, JetBlue's forward P/E ratio would be 6.23 to 7.48, placing the stock in value territory. Another strong suit for JetBlue is its EBITDA margin, which is second only to Southwest at a solid 17%.

Financial,"   With dominant Pacific Northwest exposure and a smiling Eskimo on the tail of its planes, what's not to love about the Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK)? Alaska Air (Alaska) was the best-performing major airline of the 2010s, rising more than three times the S&P 500. With the new decade upon us and earnings coming on Jan. 23, could Alaska continue soaring in the years ahead?  ALK DATA BY YCHARTS Alaska airlines exclusively covers routes in North America and Central America. The company has an entrenched presence in Alaska and the northwest United States, an attractive position for investors looking to invest in an airline with loyal customers and growing tourism.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In 2016, Alaska bulked up its West Coast coverage with its acquisition of Virgin America, hoping to increase business in California, a state led by Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL). After a rocky introduction of routes in 2017, Alaska announced plans in August 2019 to connect California routes to the Pacific Northwest starting in January 2020. As the airline that offers ""more flights to more destinations from the West Coast than any other airline,"" Alaska is staging in its California expansion by leveraging its existing strength further up north the coast. For those curious about Alaska Air's exposure to the recent Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX scandal, the company doesn't have any of those planes in its fleet of 166 Boeing 737 aircraft, 72 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 34 Bombardier Q400 aircraft, and 60 Embraer 175 aircraft. This lack of exposure will limit Alaska's susceptibility to the hundreds of millions of dollars of lost earnings rivals like Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) are experiencing due to the ongoing groundings of Boeing's scandalous new line. Overall, Alaska Air makes up for its lack of international exposure with the moat it has created. The company invests in opportunities in its wheelhouse, expanding only to where it can gain a competitive edge. Although the surge in international air travel is attractive, and one of the driving tailwinds fueling growth in the airline industry, Alaska shareholders certainly aren't missing out given the growth Alaska has been able to generate.

Discover Thomson Reuters By Tracy Rucinski 4 MIN READ CHICAGO (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O said on Thursday it had shaved $314 million from its cost base over the past three years, delivering on a cost-cutting drive designed to enable budget-friendly airfares over the next decade. Curbing costs is a priority for many companies, but particularly for airlines like JetBlue, where costs have been rising faster than for many peers and whose business model depends on fares that can compete with legacy airlines. The savings surpassed the company's $250 million to $300 million target, thanks in part to renegotiated engine maintenance contracts as it transitions to an all-Airbus AIR.PA fleet. JetBlue, which spends $325 to $350 million a year on engine maintenance alone, signed a new contract for half of the 400 engines that power its A321 and A320 fleet this summer and is in the final contract phase for the other half. Shares were up 4.7% at $20.72, outperforming stocks of other U.S. airlines. The balance between product and cost for JetBlue - which sets itself apart from rivals by offering perks like extra legroom in coach, seatback Live TV and free Wi-Fi - had become a concern for investors. Operating expenses per available seat mile, excluding fuel - a key performance metric - were flat in the fourth quarter thanks to the savings program and are expected to decline up to 2% in 2020 after a slight spike in the first quarter, JetBlue said. “We’ve been able to get the balance right,” Chief Financial Officer Steve Priest told Reuters. JetBlue expects to receive its first A220 jet at the end of this year and a total of 70 by late 2024 or early 2025 to replace its Embraer fleet, a move that will provide an extra 30% reduction in operating seat cost compared to the Embraer E190. Aside from the engine deals, Priest said the company has 160 different cost initiatives including new technology and a productivity drive that will continue to bear fruit over the decade. JetBlue also plans to take delivery of 11 A321neo jets in 2020.

China put millions of people on lockdown in two cities at the epicentre of the outbreak that has killed 17 people and infected nearly 600. Fears of the fast-spreading coronavirus hitting the global economy have knocked world stock markets off record highs this week, while early earnings reports have brought few surprises to investors. “There is some fear that it (coronavirus) appears to be spreading, and certainly there are some fears about what it is going to do to the Chinese economic growth,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments. “People are generally trading off the assumption of a very bad outcome.” At 1:23 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.39% to 29,071.02. The S&P 500 edged 0.26% lower to 3,313.19 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.14% to 9,371.02. After taking a hit earlier this week on worries about travel demand, airline stocks recovered, with Southwest Airlines Co gaining 2.3% and American Airlines Group Inc rising 1.4% after quarterly earnings.
