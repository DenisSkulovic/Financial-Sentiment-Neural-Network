COVID-19 is a different beast than any other of the major virus outbreaks we have seen in the past two decades. A comparison of airlines’ stock price performance during COVID-19, SARS, H1N1 (Swine Flu) and MERS clearly shows that this time is different. As the International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently reported, the coronavirus outbreak will have an impact on the financial performance of the industry unlike anything we have seen before. Current estimates (as of March 22) project that industry passenger revenues could plummet $252 billion or 44% below 2019’s figure and industry cash burn exceeding $60 billion in Q2 only. We expect these estimations to become even more bearish over the next few weeks as air travel demand has evaporated in all regions of the world by now – see our Flight Demand Tracker.

The industry gets a double shot of good news concerning the stimulus package,"   Airline stocks are gaining altitude again on Thursday, after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said assistance for the industry is a top priority, and companies could be hearing from his department by the weekend. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) led the way, up 17.6% as of 11 a.m. EDT; shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), and Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) were all up more than 13%. JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) is up more than 9%. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), arguably the two strongest companies in the sector, were up 6.8% and 5.2%, respectively. The airlines have been among the sectors hardest-hit by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, with demand for air travel all but evaporating and revenue plummeting. The companies have responded by cutting flights and grounding planes, but with second-quarter revenue expected to decline by as much as 90% year over year, arguably no amount of cuts could be enough to sustain the industry. The industry is set to receive up to $50 billion in loans and grants. as part of the $2 trillion economic stimulus package passed by Congress in late March. But there are still questions about how the aid will be distributed, what will be required in return, and how long it will take to hit airline balance sheets. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Secretary Mnuchin, appearing on CNBC Thursday morning, said his department is ""working around the clock"" analyzing airline balance sheets and aid requests, with a plan to update the president on Thursday afternoon and get preliminary information out to the airlines by the weekend. ""It is our objective that airlines will have the liquidity to keep their workers in place,"" Mnuchin said. The size of the Thursday jumps correlate pretty well with how desperately the airlines need the assistance, with the airlines perceived to be weaker gaining more than those perceived as having more of a cash runway. The government assistance will help, but as said above, there is no amount of cash that will make the airlines viable indefinitely if traffic doesn't return. The sector got good news on that front too from the Mnuchin interview, with the secretary saying the White House could begin to restart the economy as soon as May if there's ample evidence the worst of the pandemic is behind us.

What","   Shares of airlines and the businesses that support the industry have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused travel demand to all but evaporate and left airlines scrambling to cut costs. We know the near-term damage to these businesses will be severe, but what we don't know is how long that damage will last. In recent days, markets have traded higher on a belief the worst of the pandemic might soon be behind us, sparking hope of a late spring recovery. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) gained 10% on Wednesday, while shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) both were up 5% around midday. And some of the businesses that rely on the airlines have performed well, too, with online travel agency Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) up more than 6% and Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR), which runs the back-end reservation systems for many airlines, up 8%. Investors, including high-profile ones, have dumped airline shares for weeks now as the companies have been forced to take drastic action to preserve their balance sheets and remain solvent through the pandemic. Delta, for example, said it expects second-quarter revenue to fall 90% year over year, adding that it is burning through about $400 million in cash reserves per week. The industry is getting $50 billion in economic support to try to weather the storm, but no amount of assistance will be enough if travel does not return by late summer at the latest. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Improving sentiment this week about how long the pandemic might last and optimism about the economy's ability to recover have provided a lift to airlines and the companies that support them. The industry came into this sudden downturn healthy by historical standards, and can likely survive even if travel only returns to typical recessionary levels. The greater the chances that the economy can quickly return to a more functional operation, the more travel stocks begin to look oversold. For companies like Expedia and Sabre, it is going to be difficult to post solid earnings until travel returns. Sabre shares also likely got a boost after a Delaware judge ruled in the company's favor in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice seeking to block the company's $360 million purchase of Farelogix, which provides software to the airline industry.

Are U.S.,"April 08, 2020 — Amid the quickly spreading COVID-19 pandemic that triggered a voluntary shutdown of virtually all domestic and international passenger flights in the U.S., airlines have been struggling to stay afloat financially. Airline stocks have been among the most hard-hit groups of stocks, and this begs the question: Does any of them present a profitable investment opportunity for a value investor? In this light, I believe that examining four specific aspects, as follows, will provide a decent framework to think about the answer. 1. Historical lessons: What have we learned from the past? 2. Current risks: What impact does a potential government bailout have on the return prospect of airline stocks? Which airlines have the financial wherewithal to survive the crisis? 3. Future risks: Does a V-shaped, U-shaped, or L-shaped recovery seem more probable? What will post-crisis performance scenarios look like for airlines? 4. Risks vs. Return: Do the current prices present an attractive entry point, given the risks? Let’s go over them one by one. Looking back at the history of events disrupting the U.S. airlines, the SARS epidemic in 2002–2003 and the 9/11 attacks in 2001 carry the most resonance. So far, COVID-19 has had a far greater impact on U.S. airline stocks than the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic and the 9/11 attacks did. The chart below shows the average daily percent change of U.S. airline stock prices, starting on the day of the first reported incident of either SARS or COVID-19 infection or of the day of the 9/11 attacks. Airline stocks found their bottoms on the 78th trading day and the 9th trading day into the SARS epidemic and the 9/11 attacks, respectively. At these bottoms, airline stocks on average dropped by approximately 31% and 44%, respectively. The COVID-19 drove U.S. airline stocks past the SARS bottom in around two-thirds of the time, down staggeringly 95%. Looking at when U.S. airline stocks reverted back to the pre-incident levels, it took a total of 57 and 115 trading days for the 9/11 event and SARS, respectively. From the days that these airline stocks bottomed, it took between 2 and 2.5 months for them to revert to their respective pre-incident levels. During the SARS episode, however, U.S. airline stocks only bottomed roughly a month after the outbreak had peaked. Thus far, we have seen tentative signs of a peak in some U.S. States, especially in New York,","Apr 8, 2020",https://medium.com/the-capital/are-u-s-airline-stocks-worth-investing-in-right-now-34f213229f0c

Business Reporter Investors are being warned about piling money into the travel and leisure sectors after their recent surge. Travel and leisure stocks including airlines and cinema chains have been hit hard by the coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions. While their valuations have plummeted across the board, some stocks have seen their share prices rocket this week. On Tuesday, cinema chain Cineworld shot up almost 50% while cruise ship operator Carnival surged more than 20%. Cineworld, the world's second biggest cinema chain, announced bosses had waived salaries and bonuses as part of a survival plan to tackle coronavirus lockdowns. Admitting the current situation was ""extremely challenging"", Cineworld said it had scrapped a planned dividend to shareholders for the last quarter of 2019. But its share price shot up 49% on the London Stock Exchange despite its bleak outlook, with more than 780 cinemas closed across 10 countries. Another travel and leisure stock, cruise ship operator Carnival, also saw a big price rise on Tuesday, after Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund took a 8.2% stake in it. Carnival's share price rose 11% on the New York Stock Exchange and 22% on the London Stock Exchange. The cruise ship industry has been battered during the coronavirus pandemic with a number of outbreaks at sea raising concerns about the safety of cruise holidays. Carnival has cancelled a series of scheduled sailings for 2020 and said it may struggle with bookings for 2021. Given the dire outlook for the industry, experts are warning investors to tread cautiously when thinking these stocks have ""bottomed out"" and may be staging a recovery. ""Leisure and travel stocks are emerging from a deep and dark place,"" said Stephen Innes, global market strategist at AxiCorp. ""While people will return to cinemas, revenues may be slow to pick up as movie goers and the industry respects social distancing guidelines."" After cinemas reopen, Mr Innes says they may continue to space out customers, which will reduce capacity and revenues.

""The airlines are not listening to their passengers,"" Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said in an interview on Wednesday. ""They're going to wind up paying a price for this in the next piece of legislation which we pass."" U.S. carriers have secured almost $60 billion from the federal government in cash grants and loans. In exchange, the airlines agreed to not lay off employees through September, to place limits on executive compensation for two years and to eliminate stock buybacks for at least a year. Markey said airlines are being ""greedy"" by refusing to issue refunds for canceled flights. ""Passengers need to stay alive the same way that the airlines now can stay alive because of the federal taxpayer,"" Markey said. A little over a week ago, Markey and eight other Democratic senators sent letters to all the major U.S. airline CEOs, urging them to issue refunds. The senators asked for a response by Tuesday. As of Wednesday morning, lawmakers hadn't received enough responses to determine whether or not ""the industry is going to comply,"" Markey said. ""A passenger in the era of the Coronavirus pandemic should not have to have a voucher for a future trip. That passenger needs the money in their pocket right now to pay for food, to pay for rent, to pay the mortgage."" On Monday, a police officer from Minnesota, Jacob Rudolph, filed a lawsuit against United Airlines over a rejected ticket refund claim. A United spokesperson told ABC News that the company was served with the complaint on Tuesday evening and currently is reviewing it. The spokesperson said United's policy on refunds is that if the airline changes a flight and can't get a passenger to their destination within six hours, that customer is eligible for a refund. According to Rudolph, United offered to rebook his flight or issue him a ticket credit for travel within one year of the issue date.

Discover Thomson Reuters By Terje Solsvik, Victoria Klesty 4 MIN READ OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air NWC.OL plans to convert up to $4.3 billion of its debt into equity and to issue new shares as it seeks to stay in business following the COVID-19 outbreak that has grounded almost all of its fleet, the budget carrier said on Wednesday. The move would allow the airline to tap government guarantees of up to 3 billion Norwegian crowns ($292 million), which are dependent on the company reducing its ratio of debt to equity. Growing rapidly in the last decade to become Europe’s third-largest low-cost airline and the biggest foreign carrier serving New York and other major U.S. cities, Norwegian had accumulated debts and liabilities of close to $8 billion by the end of 2019. On March 16, the company announced temporary layoffs of 7,300 employees, about 90% of its workforce, and the following day called on Norway’s government for help, saying it needed cash “within weeks, not months”. “The proposed measures are necessary in securing the next tranches of the Norwegian government state guarantee program,” Chief Executive Jacob Schram said in a statement on Wednesday, announcing the measures on the eve of Norway’s Easter break. “They are also necessary for the future of the company by strengthening the company’s balance sheet,” added Schram, who joined the airline only last year, adding work had begun on building the future “New Norwegian”. The company must convince its creditors to agree to the plan before it is put to a shareholders’ vote on May 4. If approved, Norwegian would convert part or all of its bonds worth 5.68 billion crowns into shares as well as leasing debt of up to 38.82 billion crowns, the company said. It would also aim to raise at least 300 million crowns of fresh cash by selling new shares, with the aim of reaching a total of 400 million to meet government terms for its aid. Those deals are far in excess of the company’s market capitalisation of 1.4 billion crowns and will significantly dilute existing equity.

14,U.S. Aid to Airlines Delayed Amid Requests for More Financial Data - TheStreet,. . U.S. Aid to Airlines Delayed Amid Requests for More Financial Data. McConnell Hopeful for Stimulus Bill Agreement on,"  The problem with the government rescue is that the airlines have to go through a laborious process, with requirements that they provide more detailed financial information than they have so far, knowledgeable sources told Bloomberg. Major airlines are losing tens of millions of dollars a day in revenue, as the coronavirus pandemic has kept would-be travelers at home, and some airline staffers who are working have caught the virus.  The fund holds Delta Airlines  (DAL) - Get Report, United Airlines  (UAL) - Get Report, American Airlines  (AAL) - Get Report, Southwest Airlines  (LUV) - Get Report and JetBlue Airways  (JBLU) - Get Report along with others. The airlines that filed for assistance April 3, just a few days after the $2 trillion fiscal stimulus package was passed by the government, expected the cash to begin flowing several days ago, the Bloomberg sources said. That money is targeted to pay airline employees. But the Treasury Department has asked for more information that seems to be more relevant to a separate loan process rather than the cash grants, the sources said. For now the concern hasn't reached the stocks and the Global Jets ETF, which at last check traded at $15, up 5.2%. Among the individual carriers: Delta shares were up 4.9% at $24.36; United shares added 6.9% to $29.41; American Air was at $11.90, up 5%; Southwest climbed 3.6% to $35.55, and, JetBlue tacked on 3.3% to $9.33.

15,Delta Airlines (DAL) Stock Has Crashed and Is Now Headed Back Up | InvestorPlace,Delta Airlines Stock Has Crashed and Is Now Headed Back Up. What goes up must come down. That saying will," A lot has changed in the last two months for airline stocks. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has fallen almost 70% from its January highs. Up until then, it was outperforming its peers United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Now, DAL stock is just as stuck. It clearly faces tremendous headwinds as the world tries to overcome the novel coronavirus.  Sentiment was already bad in February, but it’s sinking even lower now. Since the world is still under quarantine, the demand for air travel is a tiny sliver of what it once was. Hardly anyone is flying. Because of this, many on Wall Street are worried that airlines won’t survive the crisis. To make matters worse, we learned this week that Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) Warren Buffett sold some of his Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and DAL stock. The markets shrugged off the news because Berkshire still holds over 50 million shares of each. Therein lies the opportunity for investors. The fear in airline stocks may have already reached a peak, so even if the fundamentals deteriorate, investors have already priced the risks in.  Airlines have no income right now, so value will be a tough sell as price-earnings ratios become irrelevant. But the thesis here is simple, and it revolves around the upcoming election. There is no way that incumbent President Donald Trump will let U.S. airlines fall this year. And Democrats will not impede his efforts, because no candidate wants to be the one to kill a U.S. airline. I think the world learned its lesson after the Lehman Brothers. Too big to fail is a real concept. Here, DAL stock is tussling with levels from its very first quarter as a public company. After the 2007 crash, it took its time building a strong base for a rally in 2013. But the recent crash brought the stock price to that exact neckline (see chart). Since then, the stock bounced 40% off the neckline. But there is so much uncertainty that we will see the price see-saw wildly in this massive range. What should investors do with DAL stock? They should either actively trade around short-term levels or bet on the longer-term recovery of the sector. The world stopped flying on demand and it will restart the same way. In the next 60 days people will need to fly again. Air travel is not optional, it","Apr 8, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/04/delta-airlines-dal-stock-crashed-headed-back-up/

17,Stocks Rise Despite Weak Jobs Data as Fed Weighs In | Barron's,"Stocks Post Strong Gains for the Week. . . ALSO READ. 8 Hardware Stocks to Buy for 2021, According to","    Stocks’ gains faded in the last hour of trading on Thursday, but major indexes nonetheless ended the week with big gains. Investors shrugged off the latest figures illustrating the economic damage being wrought by the coronavirus and welcomed another effort by the Federal Reserve to limit the pain. But turmoil in global oil markets and traders fearful of holding through a long weekend put a dent in Thursday’s rally. Oil prices initially shot higher after it appeared that OPEC and non-OPEC producers may be about to cut supply, but quickly changed course and turned lower as it became clear that further talks would be required. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 286 points, or 1.2%, after having been up over 500 points earlier in the day. The index rose 12.7% in the four-day week. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite ended Thursday 1.5% and 0.8% higher, respectively. They gained 12.1% and 10.6% this week. It was the S&P 500’s best week since 1974, and the Nasdaq’s best since 2009. Stocks were buoyed by a range of factors including favorable data on the spread of the coronavirus and the exit of Sen. Bernie Sanders from the presidential race. The major indexes rallied Thursday despite news that 6.6 million people filed initial claims for unemployment benefits in the latest week—bringing the total over the past three weeks to almost 17 million. Investors appeared to welcome plans by the Fed to deploy $2.3 trillion in lending to support markets for riskier corporate debt, ease funding strains for states and cities, and provide deferrable loans to small and medium businesses. The moves go beyond anything the central bank did during the financial crisis just over a decade ago. Oil prices gave up nearly 10% gains on Thursday afternoon, with West Texas Intermediate—the U.S. benchmark oil price—closing down 9.3%, to $22.76 a barrel. Saudi Arabia and Russia have signalled openness to reducing supply in recent days, and have reportedly settled on a cut of several million barrels a day—a large portion of global demand during normal times. But other players in the international oil cartel didn’t appear to be on board with the cuts just yet. And these aren’t normal times. Coronavirus-related downturns in travel and economic activity have caused global demand for oil to plummet. Even after a 30% rally since the start of April, the price of","Apr 9, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/stocks-moving-premarket-xerox-pfizer-exxon-mobil-halliburton-51586433412

But some sectors have been hit harder than others, and this article looks at three – oil, airlines, and leisure. This article isn’t personal advice. If you're not sure what’s right for your circumstances, please ask for advice. Investing in individual companies isn’t right for everyone. They are higher-risk as your investment depends on a single company – if the company fails you risk losing your whole investment. You should make sure you understand the companies you’re investing in, their specific risks, and make sure any shares you own are held as part of a diversified portfolio. Sophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst Disagreements between Russia and Saudi Arabia sent oil prices tumbling in early March, as the countries started ramping up supply. This has come at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has caused global demand to slump. If planes aren’t flying and no one’s driving to work, the world needs less oil. All of that means since 6 March the oil price has fallen almost 25% to around $33. That follows a rise in recent days – at the end of March the price was as low as $23, as shown below. This inevitably creates some serious challenges for the companies involved in oil. Past performance is not a guide to future returns Source: Eikon, 7 April 2020 Cheap oil directly impacts the revenues of oil companies, and that will hurt some more than others.
