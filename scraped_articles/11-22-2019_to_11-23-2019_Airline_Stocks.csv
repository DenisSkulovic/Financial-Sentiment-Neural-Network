1,Here's How Much Warren Buffett Has Made on Delta Air Lines | The Motley Fool,Here's How Much Warren Buffett Has Made on Delta Air Lines. Buffett's opinion of airline stocks has changed dramatically in,"   Warren Buffett once avoided owning airline stocks, famously writing in 2007 that ""if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down."" But the airline business has changed in recent years, and so too has Buffett's opinion of the sector. Beginning in 2016, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) began buying a basket of airline stocks, including shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), one of a handful of major carriers to survive a round of bankruptcies and consolidation that helped stabilize the industry and improve its profitability. IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. Was the Oracle of Omaha correct to change course and climb aboard Delta, or would he have been better off spending the money on a time machine to try to head back to 1903 Kitty Hawk with a bazooka? Here's a look at how Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Delta has done. First, some caveats. We don't know the exact days Berkshire Hathaway bought most of its Delta shares, or what specific price it paid for each share. But Berkshire files quarterly statements with regulators disclosing its holdings, giving us a rough idea of when shares were bought and sold and an average price paid. These are back-of-the-envelope calculations, and not precise enough to send to the IRS, but should be close. Berkshire Hathaway began buying Delta stock in the third quarter of 2016, buying 6.3 million shares at an average price of $39 per share. By the next filing deadline, three months later, Berkshire had increased its stake by nearly 59 million shares, having bought at an average price of about $48 apiece. A final chunk of 5.4 million shares was added over a three-day period in March 2019 at an average price of about $49.52. In total, according to a recent filing, Berkshire Hathaway owns about 70.9 million shares of Delta Air Lines, having spent nearly $3.1 billion to buy the shares. Based on Delta's Nov. 14 closing price of $56.55 per share, the Delta stake is now worth just over $4 billion, a gain of almost 30%.  DAL VS. S&P 500 SINCE BERKSHIRE STARTED BUYING IN DATA BY YCHARTS The actual return is significantly higher. Delta pays a quarterly dividend that has been going up steadily over the years, from $0.2025 per share in December 2016 after Berkshire first bought","Nov 23, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/23/heres-how-much-warren-buffett-has-made-on-delta-ai.aspx
2,Investors are left to wonder if the stock market rally is resting or rolling over,"Investors are left to wonder if the stock market rally is resting or rolling over. S&P 500, 1-year:. Overbought?. Leaders","(This story is part of the Weekend Brief edition of the Evening Brief newsletter. To sign up for CNBC’s Evening Brief, click here.) This month has become a sideways “slowvember” slide in recent weeks, with stocks remarkably steady near record highs, as investors are again left to wonder if the tape is resting or rolling over. The August lows in both the S&P 500 and 10-year Treasury yields continue to look like consequential bottoms, reflecting a late-summer overshoot to the downside for both in a fit of global recession panic that now appears to have been premature and left most investors defensive and unprepared for a quick rebound. Yet the relief rally that led to a surge in bond yields and cyclical stocks has receded a bit, and short-term gauges of investor sentiment became stretched, restraining the indexes in a narrow band in recent weeks. Restrained, but so far resilient: Dips have been shallow, with the index halting declines just below the 3,100 mark. For the past two weeks, the S&P has hovered in about a 1% range between 3,090 and 3,122. The action resembles what occurred for a few weeks in September, when the S&P hugged the 3,000 level after a 6%, one-month rebound. It eventually gave way to a choppy 3% setback before a slingshot move higher into November, largely tracking reports of trade-deal progress or its lack.  Short-term trader sentiment has become a bit too bullish, arguably, with scant demand for downside put protection and the spread between bulls and bears in the weekly Investors Intelligence poll of advisory services reaching the upper end of its multi-year range — though nowhere near the giddy heights of January 2018.. The climb to new highs was sharp and persistent enough to make the major indexes overbought — meaning they had extended far above a longer-term trend, a sign both of impressive momentum and vulnerability to a quick setback. This Bespoke Investment Group plot of the S&P 500 relative to its 50-day average shows the tape coming off the boil without much damage at all in terms of broad-market downside yet.  Source: Bespoke Investment Group Canaccord Genuity strategist Tony Dwyer, who remains bullish on stocks heading into 2020, nonetheless has been looking for a downside jolt of somewhere less than 5% to reset sentiment and refresh buying appetites through lower prices. “Over the past two weeks, the market","Nov 23, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/23/investors-are-left-to-wonder-if-the-stock-market-rally-is-resting-or-rolling-over.html

5,Should Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Be Disappointed With Their 44% Profit? - Simply Wall St News,Should Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Be Disappointed With Their 44% Profit?. What About Dividends?. A Different Perspective. Discounted cash flow calculation,"The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) share price is up 44% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. Also positive is the 8.3% share price rise over the last year. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. During five years of share price growth, Southwest Airlines achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7.6% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. You can see below how EPS has changed over time. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.. As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Southwest Airlines the TSR over the last 5 years was 51%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence! Southwest Airlines provided a TSR of 9.8% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 8.6% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy.

(LON:IAG)'s Upcoming Dividend - Simply Wall St News","Here's What We Like About International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (LON:IAG)'s Upcoming Dividend. Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?. Final","Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (LON:IAG) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. You will need to purchase shares before the 28th of November to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of December. International Consolidated Airlines Group's next dividend payment will be UK£0.12 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed UK£0.31 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, International Consolidated Airlines Group has a trailing yield of approximately 4.8% on its current stock price of £5.552. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether International Consolidated Airlines Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether International Consolidated Airlines Group has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately International Consolidated Airlines Group's payout ratio is modest, at just 28% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (76%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously. Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see International Consolidated Airlines Group's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 76% per annum for the past five years. Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth.

Drone Delivery Canada revolutionizes,"      Debra Ray | November 22, 2019 | More on: FLT The race to launch and scale drone delivery is much like the race to put a man on the moon in the mid-twentieth century. Nations, including Canada, are pumping a lot of money into automated aerial delivery systems, which are set to replace traditional short-distance logistics, drop shipping, and fulfillment services. In the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration approved UPS as an air carrier in October, making it the first national U.S. drone airline. Big tech companies like Amazon and Alphabet have already launched test programs before expanding drone delivery services to more customers. In December, Amazon will launch a Prime Air drone program in select areas to identify common pitfalls and devise solutions before a full rollout. But, that isn’t where the success stops; also, in October, a Google affiliate, Wing, began testing drone-delivered packages in Christiansburg, Virginia. Canadian investors should also take note of drone delivery testing in Canada. The TSX has its drone delivery technology corporation, Drone Delivery Canada Corp (TSX:FLT), a venture-traded stock headquartered in Ontario. Since 2009, the company has been researching and developing commercial technology to transform Canadian logistics. On Wednesday, Drone Delivery Canada announced a new partnership with Air Canada and the Edmonton International Airport to manage the first drone delivery service from an airport. A partner like Air Canada is big news for a stock with a market cap of $130 million, trading at $0.74 per share. Air Canada will provide sales and marketing support for Drone Delivery Canada, which has boasted licensed air carrier status with Transport Canada since 2017. Edmonton will provide the infrastructure and storage for the drone fleet. Meanwhile, Transport Canada will have access to all the data from the drone flights to augment and refine Canada’s drone delivery policies. Aspiring Canadian retirees can pick up 100-shares of Drone Delivery Canada for only $74. Micro-cap stocks in high growth, highly skilled technology verticals promise a minimal downside with great long-term upside potential. If you want to retire in 20 to 30 years, this stock is the perfect long-term investment.

Canopy Growth (WEED:CT). .,"    Nov 22, 2019  The Canadian Press Canopy Growth's Tweed facility in Smiths Falls, Ontario opens a new visitor centre on Thursday, Aug. 23, 2018. , THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick   TORONTO -- Shares of Canopy Growth Corp. closed down almost 10 per cent Friday after global alcohol giant Constellation Brands Inc. said it did not plan to make any more cash contributions to the cannabis firm. Constellation Brands made the comment in a U.S. regulatory filing where it said it expects to record a comparable nine month net loss of US$125.4 million in its Canopy investment. Victor, N.Y.-based Constellation Brands said it still holds warrants to buy Canopy Growth shares, including some priced at less than half Canopy's current share price, but that it will evaluate use of the blocks of warrants prior to their expiration in May 2020 and in November 2023. Beyond the warrants, Constellation said it does not plan any further cash contributions to the company as it says Canopy is adequately capitalized with more than $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30. The company behind brands like Corona beer announced a deal in August of last year to invest $5 billion in Canopy Growth to secure a 38 per cent ownership of the company and become the largest shareholder. In June, the booze brand said it was ""not pleased"" with Canopy's earnings after a wider-than-expected net loss. A week later company founder and CEO Bruce Linton was forced out of his position, and the company. In August, Constellation recognized a US$839-million decrease in the fair value of its Canopy investments during the quarter ended Aug. 31 as the cannabis industry struggles to meet expectations post-legalization. The same month, Canopy reported a $1.28-billion loss or $3.70 per share for the three months ended June 30, mainly due to a non-cash loss of $1.18 billion on the extinguishment of warrants held by Constellation. Since legalization, Canadian cannabis companies have struggled on profitability and many have missed expectations, driving share prices down. Canopy's shares, which hit a high of $70.98 in April, closed down $2.56 or 9.5 per cent at $24.47 Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

15,Boeing gives 737 MAX 10 a low-key rollout in Renton - GeekWire,"With grounding still in force, Boeing gives 737 MAX 10 jet a low-key rollout in Renton. Is your company's productivity","BY ALAN BOYLE on November 22, 2019 at 3:01 pm Hundreds of Boeing employees turned out today for the official rollout of the company’s biggest 737 MAX — a traditional rite in the birth of an airplane that was more muted this time, due to the eight-month-long grounding of all 737 MAX jets. The 737 MAX 10 is a stretch version of the MAX 9, capable of accommodating 10 more seats (230 vs. 220 maximum) with slightly less maximum range (3,800 vs. 4,080 miles with an auxiliary tank). The smaller MAX 7 and MAX 8 fill out the product line. Boeing has more than 550 orders and commitments for the MAX 10 from more than 20 customers around the globe. But the whole 737 MAX family is still in limbo because of the grounding that followed two catastrophically fatal accidents last year in October and this year in March. Investigators traced the cause to a problem with an automatic flight control system on the 737 MAX. Boeing says a software patch will take care of the problem, but the Federal Aviation Administration still has to sign off on the plan for the upgrades and for pilot training. The planes aren’t likely to return to service until next year. The first 737 MAX 10’s emergence from the factory floor in Renton, Wash., was an opportunity to recognize the efforts of Boeing employees to keep the program on track despite the past year’s tragedies and challenges. “Today is not just about a new airplane. It’s about the people who design, build and support it,” Mark Jenks, vice president and general manager of the 737 program, was quoted as saying in a Boeing news release. “This team’s relentless focus on safety and quality shows the commitment we have to our airline customers and every person who flies on a Boeing airplane.” The plane will undergo a series of system checks and engine runs on the ground in preparation for next year’s expected test flights. “I’m honored to take this airplane on its first flight and show the world what you’ve put your heart and soul into,” 737 Chief Pilot Jennifer Henderson told the crowd. Here are some of the tweets from today’s rollout: Chopper 7 over the Boeing 737 MAX 10, which the company rolled out this morning in Renton. Unlike some previous rollouts, reporters were not invited.

17,Spicejet chief explains why Boeing 737 MAX will be the safest aircraft in the world when it returns - The Financial Express,Spicejet chief explains why Boeing 737 MAX will be the safest aircraft in the world when it returns. India’s second-largest,"India’s second-largest airline Spicejet said that the currently grounded Boeing 737 MAX will be the safest aircraft in the world once it makes its comeback. “This has been the longest grounding of an aircraft ever. This has to be the most inspected aircraft ever. When it is going to fly, it will probably be the safest aircraft to fly just because of the kind of scrutiny that it is going through,” Ajay Singh, chairman, Spicejet, told reporters early this week in a press meet. He added that the nature of the accidents has made the regulators to be extremely careful and extremely cautious. “The regulators now want to look at every little aspect, and they should once there is an accident,” he said. Since the entire Boeing 737 MAX fleet of Spicejet remains idle, Spicejet has been incurring huge losses but the American planemaker Boeing has assured the airlines around the world that it will pay up for the losses. Spicejet has been hoping for Boeing’s return since switching to other aircraft is not an easy task to do, Ajay Singh had earlier told a news channel. The return of Boeing 737 MAX will mean a massive inflow of capacity in Spicejet’s fleet. “With MAX’s comeback, we will grow by a significant number next year and we will have to manage that growth,” Ajay Singh said at the same event. The airline has also announced cargo operations as its plan to utilize large fleet. Why was Boeing 737 MAX grounded? Boeing 737 MAX was grounded worldwide after the Ethiopian plane crash tragedy which ended up killing hundreds of passengers. The aircraft by American planemaker has been grounded since March 2019. The same has resulted in massive losses for many carriers around the world including India’s Spicejet, which is the largest customer of Boeing 737 aircraft in India.  Meanwhile, Boeing 737 MAX airline is expected to make its comeback by January 2020 as it is in process to secure safety nods from global aviation regulators including Indian aviation watchdog DGCA. DGCA has also asked for a mandatory pilot training for Boeing 737 MAX aircraft before the plane takes it back to the skies.
