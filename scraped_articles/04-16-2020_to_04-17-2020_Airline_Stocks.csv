0,Airline Stocks Take a Dive as One CEO Issues Dire Warning | Barron's,Airline Stocks Take a Dive as One CEO Issues Dire Warning. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily. . . . ,"  Airline stocks were trading down sharply on Thursday as industry executives warned of more cuts to schedules and cost-cutting measures—a sign that the government’s rescue package, negotiated this week, may go only so far. United Airlines Holdings ’ (ticker: UAL) outgoing CEO, Oscar Munoz, warned employees that the situation remains dire. United will get $5 billion in grants under the Cares Act program, he said in a memo, but that doesn’t cover total payroll and only amounts to 30% of fixed and operating costs. “Non-payroll costs like airport rent, supplies and infrastructure are significant and not going away,” he added. And United will be a smaller airline by Oct. 1, when the government’s payroll support is slated to end. Shares of United were down 11.4% in recent trading. Delta Air Lines (DAL) was off 6.4%, and American Airlines Group (AAL) was down 9.4%. The NYSE Arca Airline Index was 7.1% lower, taking its loss for the year to 57.5%. The Treasury Department struck deals this week with at least 10 airlines on payroll grants worth around $25 billion. Airlines can also tap into another $25 billion in government-backed loans through a separate program, if they can’t line up financing in capital markets. But the grants don’t address the underlying problem: People simply aren’t getting on planes. Industry groups estimate that global air traffic will now fall more than 40% this year compared with 2019. Domestic air traffic is down more than 90%. Airlines can’t cope for long with a collapse in air traffic that wipes out the vast majority of their revenue. Munoz underscored the severity of the situation. Fewer than 200,000 people flew on United in the first two weeks of April, he said, compared with more than 6 million a year earlier, a 97% drop. As a result, United expects to fly fewer passengers in the month of May than it did on a single day in May 2019. The grants negotiated by airlines and the Treasury won’t dilute equity very much, as Barron’s reported, and they provide the industry with cash and liquidity to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection. But J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker notes that the Treasury actually took a hard-line stance. The grants aren’t free, as initially expected. Instead, 30% of the grants must be repaid over 10 years. That is “a significant negative development for the sector,” Baker wrote in a","Apr 16, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-stocks-take-a-dive-as-one-ceo-issues-dire-warning-51587060552
1,Why Airline Stocks Are Up Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Stocks Are Up Today. Optimistic pandemic headlines offer airline investors reason for hope.. What happened. So what. Now,"   Markets jumped on Friday on news of progress treating COVID-19 and talk of soon reopening the economy, and airline stocks joined the surge higher. Airlines have been hit hard by the pandemic, and the industry needs a rapid recovery to avoid further downsizing. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), three companies that are arguably the airlines most in need of a quick recovery, all were up 8% at the opening, while shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) all gained more than 5%. The stocks gave back some of those gains by midday, but all were still easily outperforming the S&P 500. The airline industry has seen a lot of disruption in just the past two months, with the pandemic all but eliminating travel demand and causing companies to cut schedules, ground planes, and seek other ways to reduce costs. The government came through with $50 billion in stimulus funding designed to keep employees on the payroll and buy the industry time for a recovery, but the fate of at least some of these carriers is going to come down to how quickly that recovery happens. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The airlines got good news on that front on Friday, as policymakers began to discuss the parameters needed to begin reopening businesses and lifting shelter-in-place orders. It's likely to take time for the economic recovery to begin, and expect the response to be staggered across the nation. But the discussions at least offer some amount of hope that normal activity might soon be allowed to resume. Airlines for now are holding off on layoffs, one of the conditions attached to the bailout bill. But the companies are concerned that drastic actions might have to be taken once the bailout-imposed restrictions expire at the end of September. United execs have warned employees that they expect ""our airline, and our overall workforce, to be smaller than it is today."" And Southwest, which famously was able to avoid layoffs following the attacks of Sept. 11, has reportedly begun discussions with union leaders on potential cuts in the fall. American is widely seen as the major airline most vulnerable to a prolonged slump due to its industry-high debt load, while Hawaiian with its niche network and reliance","Apr 17, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/17/why-airline-stocks-are-up-today.aspx
2,"IATA Projects More Losses for Airline Industry, Stocks Down",. . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD.,"                                                   The crisis faced by the U.S. Airline industry, courtesy of the novel coronavirus outbreak, is likely to deepen in the coming days, considering the latest forecast made by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). While IATA released poor forecast data for airline passenger revenues on Apr 14, United Airlines announced its skepticism toward the industry’s growth on Apr 15.  

Consequently, U.S. airline stocks have taken a beating over the past three days.

IATA Forecast

In its latest report, IATA announced that it expects global airline passenger revenues to decline $314 billion in 2020, a 55% downside from 2019. This indicates a deteriorating scenario for airline stocks, considering the fact that on Mar 24, IATA had estimated a 44% year-over-year decline in passenger revenues for 2020.

Notably, a drastic fall in global passenger demand due to widespread travel restrictions following the pandemic is the reason behind such a cut in projections for the industry. In early April, the number of flights globally was down 80% compared to 2019, thanks to severe travel restrictions.

IATA further estimated that the most severe impact of this phenomenon is expected to hit airline stocks in the second quarter.

United Airlines’ View

United Airlines, which holds approximately 15% market share, announced that air travel demand has been “essentially zero” in recent times and it expects no sign of improvement in the near term.

To tackle the situation, the carrier decided to further reduce its flight schedule in May to roughly 10% of what it had planned at the start of 2020, while similar cuts are in store for the month of June.

Moreover, management declared that demand is expected to remain suppressed for the remainder of 2020 and next year. This might have spooked airline investors who were already worried due to the IATA projection.

Consequently, the big four U.S. airline stocks have lost more than 5% since Apr 14.

4,LUV Stock Is Better Than the Rest of the Airliners | InvestorPlace,Southwest Airlines Stock Is Better Than the Rest of the Airliners. There is light at the end of this runway.," The level of hate for airline stocks is as high as it has ever been. That is saying a lot because investors hated them for decades because of intrinsic problems with cost and human resources controls. Since then, the airlines streamlined a lot of processes and that propped up their financial performances. Consequently and over the last few years that bad reputation abated, and then this crisis hit. Southwest Airlines (NASDAQ:LUV) has its diehard fans on main street, and LUV stock had its fair share of them on Wall Street too. But for now, investors are hating on it just like the rest.  However, today’s bet is that it will change for the better once again. This bet has gained a bit more strength after the airlines and U.S. government came to terms on the bailout deal. Ideally the airlines wanted it to be entirely a handout. Instead, they got some free money but there were also part of the aid as loans. The upside of this is that LUV stock owners will live to fight another day. The deal took long to ink because of sticky optics situations. What made matters worse for the airlines is that they spent billions on stock buybacks when they could have built coffers of reserves to withstand this shock without the treasury intervening. Therein lies the resentment against the bailout. Case in point were the harsh opinions expressed by billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya on CNBC last week. In the end, Southwest will not fail! The whole world is in quarantine and hardly anyone is flying. The Transportation Security Administration reported screening record lows that are a tiny sliver of normal days. This week, the daily scans are near 90,000 versus 2.3 million same time last years. These are astonishingly low numbers that illustrate how devastating this quarantine is for the airlines. The airlines have a huge net to cover and almost no income to offset any of the expenses. They need the U.S. to open for business and soon. Luckily we are starting to hear of plans to start reopening. This won’t be too hasty but any bits will help. They should hit the ground running because over the past few years, the airlines improved their operations at the expense of the travelers. Now, we have to pay for everything as an extra fee, even in some cases for the reclining","Apr 17, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/04/southwest-airlines-luv-stock-is-better-than-the-rest-of-the-airliners/

8,Could Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Drop to $0?,. . . . . . . . Could Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Drop to $0?. It’s 2003 all over,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | April 17, 2020 | More on: AC COVID-19 has proven to be absolutely devastating for the travel and tourism industry. The current state of the aviation sector can be best understood by the fact that airlines are forced to operate one-passenger flights. A market intelligence report regarding the travel and tourism industry indicates that many airlines all over the world will go under by the end of next month. Amid such a bleak situation, what are the chances that Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) could drop to zero? Let’s try to find that out. Before COVID-19, there was a SARS-CoV strain commonly known as the SARS virus that broke out in 2003. Unlike the coronavirus, SARS didn’t break out and spread across every continent. It was contained and remained concentrated in Asia. Nonetheless, its industrial and economic fallout was felt across the Pacific as well. For instance, that was the time when Air Canada went into bankruptcy mode and grounded 40 of its planes and slashed its route network by 17%. This time around, the outbreak is far more severe and has hit both domestic and international operations of the airline. Air Canada has decided to send more than 10,000 of its employees home, including 1,300 managers, because of the “unpredictable extent and duration” of the coronavirus pandemic. After seeing a high of $52 in mid-January, Air Canada’s stock is down by 70% since then. It is currently trading around $15 with a P/E ratio of 2.79 — one of the lowest valuations in its history. The way things stand today, one can’t say that the stock has seen its worst. In the coming days, Air Canada stock may drop to single-digit territory. Many investors think that Air Canada is too big to fail. However, that might not be the case. Firstly, it doesn’t stand on significant market capitalization. When companies with a market cap north of $50 billion are struggling, an entity with a value of around $4 billion is entirely susceptible to bankruptcy. Also, we must remember the 2003 incident, when Air Canada filed for bankruptcy and took 18 months to recover. One of the most persuasive reasons that Air Canada may not drop to zero is a possible bailout package by the government. The Canadian government might not want to replay the 2003 bankruptcy episode all over again. This","Apr 17, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/17/could-air-canada-tsxac-stock-drop-to-0/
9,Air Canada (TSX:AC): Get Ready for Warren Buffett - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Air Canada (TSX:AC): Get Ready for Warren Buffett. This is what Buffett,"      Ryan Vanzo | April 16, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) stock has collapsed following the coronavirus pandemic. Shares have lost more than 50% of their value since the year began. But there’s light at the end of the tunnel: Warren Buffett could be gearing up to buy Air Canada stock. It’s not difficult to connect the dots. Buffett and his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) are some of the largest airline shareholders in the world. At one point, Buffett was the top one or two stockholders of four different airlines. The airline industry has clearly gotten the stamp of approval from the Oracle of Omaha. But recent stock sales have caused some worry. Has Buffett soured on airline stocks? As we’ll see, the story is much more complicated. And if you’re willing to be bold and exercise some patience, you can make massive profits by investing in Air Canada before Buffett makes the jump. For years, Buffett refused to touch airlines stocks — and for good reason. The industry regularly saw massive bankruptcies, and long-term profits were nowhere to be had. “I think there have been almost 100 airline bankruptcies,” Buffett told CNBC in 2017. “I mean, that is a lot. It’s been a disaster for capital.” In 2008, Buffett joked that you could have have done future investing generations a favor by shooting down Orville Wright’s plane at Kitty Hawk. But times have changed. “It’s true that the airlines had a bad twentieth century,” Buffett later said “They’re like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way. The hope is they will keep orders in reasonable relationship to potential demand.” In 2017, Berkshire Hathaway bought stakes in Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. Today, Buffett is still one of the largest shareholders. What changed? The industry turned rational. “Buffett said the airline labor problems from previous years have been mostly resolved,” noted David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland. “You’ve had a consolidation and the airlines are less likely to have suicidal price competition.” You’ve likely experienced this in your personal travels. Planes run much closer to full capacity, and it’s become much harder to score lucrative deals. At least, that is, until the coronavirus pandemic began. Today, planes are flying nearly empty. Delta, for example, is burning","Apr 16, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/16/air-canada-tsxac-get-ready-for-warren-buffett/

Cathay,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has seen airlines taking measures to sustain their losses due to record low travel demand amid coronavirus pandemic. A month of lock down and travel bans has already passed, so what trends can we see in a troubled European aviation market? March 2020 has been seen as one of the most destructive months in history of aviation. German national carrier’s Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) share price has dropped by 61% compared to pre-crisis state with other European airlines reporting nearly identical figures. Luckily, on April 16 European stock market saw a rise after coronavirus death tolls in Spain and Italy eased. At the same time, Ryanair and EasyJet released statements and shared their outlooks on current crisis, which in turn has helped travel stocks recover. The largest airline in Europe in terms of passengers carried, Ryanair, has continued their operations, although at a very limited schedule. Due to COVID-19 airline reported to have grounded over 99% of its fleet and extended limited flight schedule to April 23, 2020. Ryanair’s CEO Michael O’Leary has openly expressed his outlook on the crisis sharing that the price war after the crisis is inevitable. He also stated that Ryanair is better prepared for a fare-slashing recovery when compared to other European carriers. Another prominent airline in European market, EasyJet announced to have secured enough capital to sustain a nine-month grounding of their fleet. The move has seen airline’s stock in the green, positively affecting share price by 2-3%. The airline has also hinted at a possibility of not selling middle seat for some time after travel restrictions will be lifted. EasyJet has grounded all of its fleet, but is hoping to have some of its operations resumed by the end of April. Now, let us turn to the second largest carrier in Europe, when measured by passenger numbers – Lufthansa Group. The group’s share price has already been on decline since 2018 with coronavirus crisis only speeding up stock price’s drop. The group had to ground over 700 aircraft as the demand for air travel bottomed out in March. One of the member airlines, Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) has started to decommission and retire older jets like Airbus A340 and Boeing 747 in an effort to control business expenditure. The airline has also requested state aid to keep its operations afloat.

11,American Airlines Earnings: What Happened with AAL,"American Airlines Earnings: What Happened. AAL misses on earnings, sales, and load factor. KEY TAKEAWAYS. What Happened. What to Look","No one was expecting anything good from American Airlines earnings this quarter. The entire airline industry has been pounded by the COVID-19 pandemic as people avoid travel, even in cases when travel isn't banned outright. American Airlines still failed to meet lowered expectations as it missed on earnings, revenue, and load factor. Its stock fell around 5% over the course of April 30, after it reported results in the morning. (Below is Investopedia's original earnings preview, published 4/16/20.) American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) shares have plunged in the past two months by more than 60% to their lowest levels in about 8 years. The stock has stayed near its 2020 bottom even as the market has staged a small spring rally. The reason for that bearish performance is the drastic decline in passenger travel at American Airlines and other carriers due to the coronavirus pandemic, which is expected to hammer earnings and revenue. Investors will be looking to see how bad the damage is when American Airlines reports earnings for Q1 2020, which is expected on April 24, 2020. 1﻿ The company has yet to release a formal date. For Q1, analysts are expecting the company to post its first net loss in at least 16 quarters, including Q1, as measured by both net income and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Also, analysts expect big declines in the airline's revenue and load factor. Investors are likely to focus closely on a key metric in American Airlines' results: its load factor. Government-imposed travel restrictions are expected to have a significant negative impact on passenger volume, as measured by the airline's load factor, for this quarter and the foreseeable future. The airline had been lagging the broader market for most of the past year, a gap that's widened with COVID-19. Its shares have posted a total return of -63.2% over the past 12 months compared to the S&P 500's total return of -4.0%. All figures are as of April 15, 2020. The past year had already been a challenging one as American Airlines was among the airlines that had to cancel flights due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. The aircraft has been grounded by regulators since mid-March 2019 for its involvement in two fatal crashes within a span of five months. 2﻿ The number of 737 Max planes in American's fleet is 24.3 Despite those troubles, the airline finished","Apr 16, 2020",https://www.investopedia.com/american-airlines-earnings-4842269

OWEN RASZKIEWICZ.,"      Site menu        The Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX: QAN) share price was trading 8% higher today following news of another round of support for domestic airlines, including Virgin Australia Ltd (ASX: VAH). For comparison, the S&P/ASX 200 (ASX: XJO) was trading at 5541.7, up 2.32%, just efore midday Friday. Qantas is Australia’s leading airline. It was founded in the Queensland outback in 1920, the Qantas name was originally Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services. The company operates two main airlines – Qantas and Jetstar – and subsidiary businesses including other airlines, businesses in specialist markets such as Q Catering, Qantas Freight Enterprises and the popular Qantas Frequent Flyer program. It employs some 30,000 people with around 93 per cent of them based within Australia. As is suggested in its name, Virgin Australia Holdings Limited is a holding company for Virgin Australia International Airlines, Virgin Australia Domestic Airlines and also Tigerair Australia. Tigerair was acquired by Virgin in 2015. The aviation sector has already received $1 billion in relief from the Government but Qantas and Virgin have asked again for bailouts which would see them through the COVID-19 crisis. There are some fears for both businesses on the stock market, but especially Virgin. Virgin Australia’s shares are currently suspended from trading on the ASX while it seeks a $1.4 billion rescue package from the Australian Government. Debt/bond market investors — and share market investors — are feeling the effects of the cancellation of travel. Last month, credit rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings downgraded the rating on Virgin’s debt given the tough outlook for the sector. Some good news finally came today for both airlines in the form of a guarantee by the Government to underwrite the costs of $165 million of domestic flights between cities and regional hubs. “We know that a strong domestic aviation network is critical to Australia’s success and today’s announcement demonstrates our commitment, yet again, to maintaining connectivity during this pandemic,” Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said on Thursday night.
