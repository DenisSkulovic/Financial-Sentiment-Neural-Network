0,3 Airline Stocks to Buy on IATA's Improved 2020 Profit View,. . . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY.,"                                                    It is no secret that stocks in the airline space have not had a great time in 2019, which is in its last leg. Headwinds like loss of revenues due to flight cancellations arising out of the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets, lackluster cargo business due to reduced freight demand and trade tensions between the United States and China have prevented the stocks from flying high this year. The downtrend can be made out from the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 Index so far this year. The industry has gained 9.6% on a year-to-date basis compared with the S&P 500’s appreciation of 23.9%. Reflecting these headwinds, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) revised its 2019 profit forecast for the industry to $25.9 billion from the $28 billion forecast provided in June. However, the research firm expects the picture to be sunnier in 2020. Profitability for the industry is expected to be $29.3 billion (average net profit per departing passenger is predicted to be $6.2 compared with 2019’s estimated figure of $5.7). The outlook for the top line is also brighter at $872 billion, suggesting 4% growth from this year. Highlights of IATA’s 2020 Forecast The bulk of the global profits ($16.5 billion) is expected from the North American region. However, the figure is lower than $16.9 billion expected in 2019. The North American region, which boasts carriers like Delta Air Lines DAL and American Airlines AAL, is likely to witness profit of $16 per passenger, on average, and net margin of 6% next year. Profits from Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America are expected to generate post-tax net profit of $7.9 billion, $6 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. However, carriers from Middle East and Africa are expected to perform dismally and register losses of $1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively. According to the forecast, passenger traffic and capacity are expected to grow at 4.1% and 4.7%, respectively, next year. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for 2020 is expected to decline 40 basis points to 82% as capacity","Dec 12, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-airline-stocks-buy-iatas-133601947.html

At 10:40 am, shares of InterGlobe Aviation, promoter of India’s largest airline by market size IndiGo, traded 0.2% higher at ₹1,340.70 a piece, having risen as much as 2% earlier in the day. SpiceJet shares traded 1.1% higher at ₹103.65, after touching an intraday high of ₹105 Domestic air passenger traffic for November grew at its fastest pace in 2019, a year in which domestic air travel has been hit by twin blows of closure of Jet Airways India Ltd and an economic slowdown. Indian airlines carried 12.95 million people in November, up 11.2% year-on-year – the fastest growth since December last year, according to data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

2,Should Value Investors Pick American Airlines (AAL) Stock? | Nasdaq,Should Value Investors Pick American Airlines (AAL) Stock?. TRENDING TOPICS. TRENDING ARTICLES. OTHER TOPICS. Latest Markets Videos. Zacks. . Explore,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value? One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put, American Airlines Group, Inc. AAL stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks: PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole. On this front, American Airlines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5.78, as you can see in the chart below:  
This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.61. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level American Airlines puts current PE ratio below its midpoint (which is 7.07) over the past five years.  
Also, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Transport sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.67. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.  
We should also point out that American Airlines has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 5.38, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Apple stock in the near term too.

P/S Ratio Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better.

3,Best ETFs for 2020: The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) Is Ready to Soar | InvestorPlace,Best ETFs for 2020: The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) Is Ready to Soar. Airline stocks surprisingly have lagged the," This article is a part of InvestorPlace.com’s Best ETFs for 2020 contest. Vince Martin’s pick for the contest is the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS).  From a broad perspective, an investor would think the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS) would be doing quite well at the moment. The U.S. economy remains strong, which usually benefits airlines and airline stocks. Worldwide demand for air travel continues to rise. Fuel costs are moderate. The long and destructive history of price wars within the industry appears to have ended. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett long avoided airline stocks for precisely that reason, but reversed field in 2016 and bought stakes in several major U.S. carriers. The news across the board seems positive. But those positive trends have done close to nothing for airline stocks, and for JETS. JETS actually has declined 3.2% over the past two years, while the S&P 500 has gained more than 18%. Only one of the four major U.S. airline stocks — United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) — has outperformed the index over that stretch, and UAL stock is actually negative over the past twelve months. At some point, that will change. Airline stocks are among the cheapest in the market, even by the standards of other cyclical stocks similarly at risk in a macroeconomic slowdown. If the economy continues to grow, airline earnings will do the same, and at some point investor confidence toward the group should pick up. The potential combination of higher earnings and higher multiples makes JETS one of the best ETFs to own in 2020. Despite its somewhat confusing title, JETS primarily invests in U.S. equities. (The “U.S. Global” in the name refers to fund sponsor U.S. Global Investors (NASDAQ:GROW), not the geographic dispersion of the fund’s holdings.) The top 13 stocks in the portfolio are all U.S. companies, which comprise 77% of the fund’s assets. The remaining 23% is distributed among 20 overseas holdings, with the U.K.’s Dart Group PLC (OTCMKTS:DRTGF) the largest at just under 2% of assets. The core of the portfolio, however, is in the four major U.S. airlines: Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines Group (NYSE:AAL). Those four stocks account for 44% of the fund. Smaller operators like Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) make up most of the remaining domestic assets. Boeing (NYSE:BA) is a holding, but represents just 2.7%","Dec 12, 2019",https://investorplace.com/2019/12/best-etfs-for-2020-u-s-global-jets-etf-ready-soar/

6,"Dow stock Home Depot is down in the past month, and it could get worse","Trouble ahead for worst Dow performer in past month, trader says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Home Depot is the worst-performing stock in the Dow in the past month, and Newton Advisor’s Mark Newton says there’s an even bigger breakdown coming for the home improvement retailer’s stock. Despite still being up 23 percent this year, shares of Home Depot have actually broken below a one-year uptrend after a 9 percent fall in the past month, Newton said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” That’s setting up the retailer for even more trouble, he added. “When you look to try and hammer down any sort of low, you just don’t see it just yet,” he said  On a monthly chart, things aren’t looking much better after the stock became overbought, said Newton. “Momentum actually went lower, and lower, and lower on this peak,” he said, referring to mid-November’s top price of about $238. “So you have what’s called negative momentum divergence, and that’s usually a warning sign,” he said.  Based on a multiyear trend line on the monthly chart, Newton said Home Depot could actually pull back to around $170 in the next few months. That’s about 20% downside from the stock’s $211 price on Wednesday. It’s also the level at which Newton would consider buying the stock. John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, said the stock reflects the state of the housing market and economy as a whole. “I’m looking through the reaction on the stock today and trying to gauge what it means for the macro picture in terms of the housing market, and the U.S. housing market is really on solid footing,” he said on “Trading Nation.” “What you’re seeing is a slowdown in the rate of change. Now that we’re at a normalized level, we’re probably going to sort of bump around in this ranged level, and I think that’s what we’re seeing, it’s the read-through on the stock.” Got a confidential news tip?

The calculation. 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast.","Does the December share price for United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. I will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: (""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 10-year government bond rate (1.7%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's","Dec 12, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-ual/united-airlines-holdings/news/is-there-an-opportunity-with-united-airlines-holdings-inc-s-nasdaqual-34-undervaluation

The","For decades the stock market has been regarded as the most reliable form of investment that our modern economy has to offer. The 10% annual return that the S&P 500 produces is a testament to how powerful the American economy is. Yet, for some people, especially younger people, the memories of the 2007 financial crisis still linger in the back of their minds. The crash of 2007 and the great recession that succeeded it was indeed harsh and unforgiving for investors.
