News Tips.","Airline stocks were in focus Wednesday morning on the promise of federal relief to help stem the damage from the coronavirus. Delta, American Airlines, JetBlue and Southwest were among the companies who said they had reached a deal to secure a slice of the $25 billion package from the Treasury Department. Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Capital, said it pays to be picky here. “Although no one may perform here over the next, say, through this year or at least the next few months -- passenger travel is down here more than 90%, China, which is moving on [from] the virus already, it’s not really seeing travel return quite yet -- And ultimately, if you were to try and find a name, I think Southwest would fit the bill for this scenario,” Baruch said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”  Southwest Airlines is down sharply this year, though not by as much as its peers – the stock has dropped 38% in 2020 compared with a more than 50% decline for the rest of the major U.S. airlines. Baruch said if Southwest can clear $38, its “path of least resistance in the near term” could be a move up to $44. It last traded at $33.40. A move to $44 implies 32% upside. Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Hermes, said federal support should give the airlines some cushioning from the worst of the economic fallout. “The airlines and the broader market in general has really benefited from some of the support from the federal government and central bank. You’ve taken the worst-case scenario off the market which is mass bankruptcies, financial system collapse and I think that the strong rally that you’ve seen has reflected that. You’ve taken the tail-risk off,” Chiavarone said during the same segment. However, he still sees the group as too risky and not as favorable as other corners of the market. “We think that they’re still going to face a kind of sharp decline in demand. We think clients or customers are going to slowly come back, particularly for leisure travel. You do have a lot of people out of work. … While we like cyclicals, maybe we like them in other areas other than the airlines,” said Chiavarone.  Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip?

The airlines were given the gift of","   The airlines secured the first tranche of their bailout late Tuesday, with a group of 10 public and privately held carriers agreeing to terms to receive some of the $25 billion in payroll support authorized under the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The deals came after a week of negotiations over how the government would be compensated for its largesse, and includes the airlines issuing warrants totaling between 1% and 3% of their total equity. They also pledged to do no layoffs before Sept. 30, an important factor for the government, given the mounting jobless claims nationally. ""We welcome the news that a number of major airlines intend to participate in the Payroll Support Program,"" Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in a statement. ""This is an important CARES Act program that will support American workers and help preserve the strategic importance of the airline industry while allowing for appropriate compensation to the taxpayers."" IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The bailout provides additional runway to allow the industry to take off once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, and it eliminates the near-term bankruptcy risk. But does it make the sector attractive for investors? The airline sector has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, which has caused travel demand to evaporate overnight. The industry has done what it can to cut costs, canceling tens of thousands of flights and grounding thousands of planes. But with revenue expected to fall by upward of 90% year over year, no amount of cutting is enough to stem the cash bleed. Some airline stocks lost more than half their value in March, with investors fearing bankruptcies were inevitable. The industry came into the pandemic relatively healthy, but if nothing else, a significant number of layoffs and furloughs would have been required absent government assistance. The amounts requested totaled more than the $25 billion allotted, meaning no carrier got enough to fully cover payroll. It appears airlines were granted funds to cover about three-quarters of their actual payroll in the second and third quarters of 2019. ""This is an essential step, but just one of many that will get us through the next several months,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees.

6,Why Airline Shares Are Up Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Up Today. The industry is closing in on much-needed bailout funds.. What happened. So what. Now,"   Airline stocks were under pressure on Monday due to investor fears that the much-anticipated federal bailout funds might be more difficult to access than first imagined. A day later, the outlook for a bailout is much better, and airline stocks are responding with gains. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) were up 10% as of 10:30 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, while shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) were all up more than 7%. A collection of other airlines including Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) were all up more than 5%. Airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused revenue to fall upward of 90% year over year as demand for travel has evaporated. The companies are cutting flights, grounding planes, and seeking other ways to cut costs, but are relying on $25 billion in government grants to make payroll and avoid a massive wave of layoffs. Some airline stocks lost more than half their value in March, but the sector was stabilized somewhat by the passage of the $2 trillion economic stimulus plan containing the airline bailout. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The requirements to receive government funds have proved to be more onerous than expected, leading to weekend news reports suggesting some airlines might not gain access to the funding package as expected. That sent shares falling on Monday. Tuesday's headlines are much more optimistic, with Reuters reporting that several large airlines were close to agreeing to the terms and quoting airline industry officials who expect all major airlines to accept the payroll grants ""in the coming days."" Reuters reported that the requirements had not changed, meaning the airlines would have to pay back 30% of the funds and issue warrants for some of the total amount they receive. It's unclear how much each airline would get. Based on 2019 data, Reuters estimates American and United are each eligible for about $6 billion in grants, while Delta would qualify for about $5.6 billion and Southwest about $4 billion. But given that the total requests are likely to far exceed the $25 billion available, airlines are unlikely to get the full amount they request. There was always reason to believe the two sides would resolve differences over the terms of the bailouts.

SHARE,"   The Late Late Show with James Corden  Shares in the ""big four"" US airlines surged in pre-market trading on Wednesday after the quartet accepted government bailouts to help them retain workers during the novel coronavirus pandemic. American Airlines soared 10%, United Airlines jumped 9%, and Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines both gained about 7%. Investors sent their stocks higher as they expect the payroll grants — which are part of the $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress last month — to keep them operating this summer despite immense challenges. Delta's CEO said this month that the airline is burning $60 million in cash each day, and demand has plummeted 95%.  The carriers initially resisted some of the terms of the relief. They bristled at having to repay 30% of the grants and hand over warrants — which can be converted into stock in the future — to the government equal to 10% of the loan portion.

CEO pay gets slashed. More personal finance,"April 16, 2020 3:23 AM GMT+3      The strings attached to the $50 billion aid package just enacted to aid America's stricken airlines will fundamentally change the industry for years to come. In exchange for the sorely needed cash, the major carriers will cease the stock buybacks and dividends that have been their main channels for rewarding investors, possibly for years, making their shares far less attractive. Strict caps on C-suite pay could make it difficult to recruit top talent. The biggest threat: The hit from the coronavirus is so unprecedented, so devastating, that carriers––some heavily leveraged today––may need to shoulder hazardous levels of government-guaranteed debt simply to survive.

It's important to distinguish between the two programs created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, better known as the CARES Act. The measure provides a total of $50 billion in assistance for passenger carriers split evenly between a $25 billion Payroll Protection Grants package, and a $25 billion a Loan and Loan Guarantees facility––we'll call them ""the Grants"" and ""the Lending"" programs."" Each imposes stringent, sometimes overlapping restrictions on the airlines that tap the programs for aid. Let's look at two areas where the requirements will re-route the flight paths for the Big Four, American, Delta, United Continental and Southwest.   The payroll grants program and the lending facility impose different restrictions on dividends and repurchases. It's important to recognize that all of the Big Four are signing up for the grants packages, and will hence be subject to its restrictions as a minimum. Its regulations stipulate that all of the cash be used for wages, salaries and benefits. It's designed to cover all compensation for Q2 and Q3 of this year. To get the cash, the airlines must maintain the same total payroll, and same level of employment as prevailed in the same two quarters in 2019––no layoffs or furloughs permitted. The Big Four will receive around $22.1 billion of the $25 billion total. But though the program is titled ""grants,"" only part of the money is actually a capital injection. Thirty-percent of the aid comes in the form of loans for a maximum of five years. The Treasury guarantees repayment to the banks that make those loans, but the airlines must pay the government back, or risk another round of bankruptcies––and as we'll see, the second program offers a far bigger bailout","Apr 15, 2020",https://fortune.com/2020/04/15/airline-bailout-terms-stock-buybacks-dividends-ceo-pay-salaries-american-delta-united-southwest/
14,3 Reasons to Think Twice Before Investing in American Airlines Stock | InvestorPlace,3 Reasons to Think Twice Before Investing in American Airlines Stock. A low entry point still doesn't make AAL stock," Over the past month, the airline industry has been hit hard by the spread of the novel coronavirus. The demand for air travel disappeared practically overnight, and all of the major airlines are feeling the effects, including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). AAL stock is down more than 19% in the last month. Things have been looking up for the industry since Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which appropriates $50 billion in relief to the airline industry and will likely help reduce layoffs and give companies a bit of short-term breathing room. This stimulus money should help keep companies like American Airlines afloat for the time being, but the AAL stock will still struggle if demand for travel doesn’t resume quickly. And even with a $50 billion airline industry bailout, American Airlines may not be a great investment going forward. Here are three things you should consider before investing in AAL stock. American Airlines has more debt than any other air carrier. By the end of 2019, its debt had reached a staggering $33.4 billion. The fact that AAL stock already had this kind of debt load, before the global health crisis, is problematic. Even with the stimulus bill and other cost-cutting measures, this kind of debt gives the company a lot less flexibility. American recently announced that it has access to $2.73 billion from three different lines of revolving credit. This indicates that the company will likely have to take on even more debt to survive the oncoming recession. American Airlines has taken steps to conserve its cash and simplify operations. The company announced its plans to retire many of its jets, including 34 Boeing 757s, 17 Boeing 767s, 20 Embraer E190s, and many others. In total, the company plans to take 156 jets out of service. The company has also drastically cut back on its summer travel schedule to accommodate the decline in demand. AAL cut its international travel schedule by 60% and is postponing new routes it had planned for 2020. Ultimately, cost-cutting measures will only help American Airlines so much. Until demand returns to the airline industry, these efforts will only slow the company’s losses. This is likely why the company is considered a moderate Sell on Wall Street and was recently downgraded by Goldman Sachs. AAL stock is down almost 60% year to date, faring a bit worse than peers,","Apr 14, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/04/3-reasons-to-think-twice-before-investing-in-american-airlines-stock/
15,Forget Airlines: 2 Top TSX Dividend Stocks to Buy Instead - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Forget Airlines: 2 Top TSX Dividend Stocks to Buy Instead. Airlines are,"      Matt Smith | April 14, 2020 | More on: BIP BIP.UN NA The stock market crash saw many Canadian stocks go on sale, with the TSX plunging by 17% for the year to date. Airlines are garnering considerable attention. Warren Buffett, after making what appears to be a disastrous foray into the industry, dumped US$388 million of Southwest Airlines and Delta Airlines two weeks ago. One of the hardest-hit TSX stocks is Air Canada, which has lost 60%, sparking speculation that it is time to buy. While Air Canada is a speculative contrarian play on the latest market crash, it is a risky investment. Airline stocks have long been held to be a great way to lose money. Even Warren Buffett, who is one of the best investors ever, had a strong dislike for the industry, claiming in 2013 that it was a deathtrap for investors. Nonetheless, Buffett went on to acquire significant positions in Delta, American, and Southwest airlines. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, it appears to be a costly mistake. There are claims that Buffett has taken a US$5 billion hit on that investment. The current crisis gripping the industry highlights why airlines are risky and unpopular investments. For those reasons, investors with a low risk tolerance who are seeking to create wealth over the long term would do better to look elsewhere. One of the surest ways to building wealth is to invest in quality dividend-paying companies with wide economic moats that are trading at attractive valuations. Here are two top-quality Canadian dividend-growth stocks that are attractively valued, making now the time to buy. Canadian banks have weathered the latest market crash in relatively good shape. The hardest hit of the Big Six has been National Bank of Canada (TSX:NA). It has fallen further than the broader TSX, losing 23% for the year to date to be trading with some attractive valuation ratios, including a price of times 2020 earnings and times book value. That sees National Bank rewarding shareholders with a regular sustainable dividend yielding a juicy 5%. National Bank, like its peers, reported some solid fiscal first-quarter 2020 numbers.

More: Coronavirus Outbreak. Figuring out 2021,"by Alan Boyle on April 14, 2020 at 7:03 pmMay 11, 2020 at 4:51 pm Ongoing coverage of COVID-19, and its impact on Seattle and the technology industry. See all of GeekWire’s special coverage. Seattle-based Alaska Airlines and nine other air carriers plan to participate in a $25 billion payroll assistance program that’s part of the coronavirus relief package signed into law last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said today. “Conversations continue with other airlines regarding their potential participation,” Mnuchin said in a statement. Today’s announcement comes after days of negotiations over the terms of the assistance program, with the Treasury Department seeking ownership stakes in at least some of the airlines that participate. Another point of contention is the Trump administration’s insistence that about 30 percent of the money provided to the airlines would be in the form of a low-interest loan. Under the deals announced today, the loans would be repaid over 10 years. If an airline’s loan exceeds $100 million, the Treasury Department would be entitled to stock warrants worth 10 percent of the excess loan amount, The New York Times reported. Airlines that accept the money would also be required to refrain from major cuts in staffing or pay through September.
