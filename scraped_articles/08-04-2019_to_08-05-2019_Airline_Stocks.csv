By: Gerelyn Terzo | Email | Leave a comment Chinese internet stocks may seem like the last place to invest considering the exposure they have to the U.S./China trade war. Stocks like Baidu were among the worst performers in the stock market, shaving 7 percent off its value and weighing on the Nasdaq in the process. Jack Ma’s e-commerce giant Alibaba shed nearly 5 percent. To say that these names are risky is an understatement, given not only the escalation of tariffs but also because of the influence of the Chinese government over these companies. Consider the issues that Tencent had publishing new video games last year on the heels of a regulatory freeze that was only lifted in early 2019. Nonetheless, as investors await a flood of analyst reports with stock downgrades after today’s debacle, one Wall Street firm says now’s the time to buy Chinese internet stocks. According to CNBC, Jefferies has attached a buy rating to Alibaba’s stock, despite the economic slowdown that China is suffering from. Alibaba is currently trading at $153, and Jefferies analysts believe that the stock has more room to run, suggesting that it is worth more than $216 and saying it has “huge potential.” In fact, Alibaba has been making strides to diversify its revenue streams, as evidenced by its recent commitment to support U.S.-based businesses.

Gold surged with the yen. More than US$700 billion were wiped from the value of U.S. equities on Monday, with the S&P 500 Index plunging three per cent and all but 11 companies in the gauge trading lower. Losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed 700 points as Apple and IBM slid at least four per cent. The Cboe Volatility Index surged about 40 per cent.

China’s yuan sank beyond 7 per dollar, a move that suggests the level is no longer a line in the sand for policy makers in Beijing.

They are personal relationships, but they greatly shape and serve the public good. Strong families make for strong communities. Conversely, family breakdown harms society as a whole. That’s why America’s declining marriage rate is a real problem. While on the surface this might not seem like an issue that you and I need to care about, the decline in marriage has a significant impact on each and every one of us—from the amount of taxes we pay to the level of crime in our neighborhoods. How do we know? Decades of statistics have shown that, on average, married couples have better physical health, more financial stability, and greater social mobility than unmarried people. Other studies show that the children of those couples are more likely to experience higher academic performance, emotional maturity, and financial stability than children who don’t have both parents in the home. The social and economic costs of family breakdown are paid by everyone. Studies show divorce and unwed childbearing cost taxpayers over $110 billion each year. But the real victims are children. Children raised in single-parent homes are statistically more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, exhibit poor social behaviors, and commit violent crimes. They’re also more likely to drop out of school. And when it comes to fighting poverty, there is no better weapon than marriage. In fact, marriage reduces the probability of child poverty by 80%.

Economic news matters to the stock market because as the economy goes, so, too, goes company profitability. Many companies whose shares trade on the stock market rely on a good economic environment.

5,Is Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) A Risky Investment? - Simply Wall St News,Is Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) A Risky Investment?. When Is Debt A Problem?. How Much Debt Does Southwest Airlines Carry?. How,"David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky. Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Southwest Airlines had US$3.14b of debt in June 2019, down from US$3.54b, one year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$3.99b in cash, so it actually has US$846.0m net cash. We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Southwest Airlines had liabilities of US$8.61b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$7.82b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$3.99b in cash and US$777.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$11.7b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables. Southwest Airlines has a very large market capitalization of US$27.2b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Southwest Airlines also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely. On the other hand, Southwest Airlines saw its EBIT drop by 2.1% in the last twelve months.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Jonathan Ford One of the oddities of the modern US stock market is its strong predilection for share buybacks. Rather than finding profitable outlets for their cash holdings by investing internally, corporations have taken to shrugging their shoulders and simply handing the stuff back en masse. The idea of shrinking the number of shares outstanding has acquired its own momentum, and buybacks have become an important driver of stock market performance. In recent years members of the S&P 500 have increased their spending on their own stock, last year retiring 4 per cent of the index’s capitalisation. That is equivalent to $800bn. Those buying back are not only mature companies, whose need for investment might be lower. They include growth stocks such as tech companies and those with big investment needs including pharmaceuticals and defence. Indeed, one of the heftier spenders of recent years has been aerospace giant Boeing. The company might seem an odd candidate for a big buyback programme. Its civil aviation business involves huge multiyear projects in which billions of dollars of capital are put at risk. The programme for the 787 Dreamliner, for instance, lasted eight years and cost $32bn. Yet Boeing has found the financial space to splurge on its own stock. Between 2013 and the end of the first quarter of this year, it retired a net 200m shares, handing back $43bn to holders. The number outstanding came down by 25 per cent. One reason it could was because of savings on the company’s latest aircraft programme, the now notorious 737 Max, grounded after two recent crashes killed 346 people. Instead of building a wholly new aircraft, Boeing simply bolted new fuel-efficient engines on to a tweaked existing airframe. That significantly reduced the airframe development costs of the project, according to company insiders. Boeing was able to redirect some of those “savings” to repurchase stock instead. It illustrates a choice that many chief executives have willingly made: to prioritise buybacks over investment. In this, they have received little but encouragement from their financial backers. Share repurchases seem a good bet to investors who are highly focused on short-term share price performance compared with the uncertain (and longer-term) gains from new product development.

9,Alaska Airlines' Hawaii Problem Is About to Get Worse | The Motley Fool,Alaska Airlines' Hawaii Problem Is About to Get Worse. Rapidly rising competition will continue to depress fares on many of,"   Over the past decade, Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) has become one of the leading carriers in the West Coast-Hawaii travel market. Today, it serves more than two dozen routes to Hawaii. These flights have been extremely successful for Alaska Airlines. However, competition has been heating up on mainland-to-Hawaii routes. United Airlines and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) -- the top two carriers in the market -- have significantly increased their Hawaii flight schedules since late 2017. Most notably, popular low-fare carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) began flying to Hawaii earlier this year. Following a long delay caused by the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, Southwest is gearing up to add more flights to Hawaii soon. With Alaska's financial performance on Hawaii routes already suffering, this could force the Seattle-based airline to start cutting back in the Hawaii market. In 2018, total airline industry seat capacity between the western U.S. and Hawaii surged 10.7% year over year. Not surprisingly, this put pressure on airfares. A SURGE IN CAPACITY HAS HURT PRICING ON WEST COAST-HAWAII FLIGHTS. IMAGE SOURCE: ALASKA AIRLINES. Growth slowed in the first quarter of 2019 -- with total seats between the western U.S. and Hawaii rising just 1% -- as airlines began to lap their capacity increases from the previous year. However, Southwest launched its first Hawaii route in mid-March, and its expansion in the following months caused industry capacity growth to accelerate once again. In June, the first full month of Southwest Airlines operating all of the flights it has announced thus far, capacity rose 8.2% between the West Coast and Hawaii. Industry capacity to Hawaii surged 68% in Oakland and 19% in San Jose. Those two cities -- Southwest's current gateways for Hawaii flights -- accounted for about half of the increase in seats to Hawaii. There were also double-digit capacity increases in Denver, Sacramento, and Seattle, as other carriers, including Alaska, continued to add flights to the Hawaiian Islands. Even in the first quarter, when West Coast-Hawaii industry capacity barely grew, Alaska Airlines experienced weak pricing on many Hawaii routes. While the second quarter is a seasonally stronger period -- and benefited from the timing of Easter this year -- Alaska's management reported further ""softness in Hawaii pricing"" due to overcapacity in the market. It expects the pressure to continue in the third quarter.

Top Stories.,"Fears of a US-China trade war sent shudders through US and European stock markets on Monday, with Wall Street recording its worst day of 2019. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 fell 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 3.5%. It followed comments from President Donald Trump who accused Beijing of currency manipulation. The Chinese yuan passed the seven-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008 - which surprised traders as Beijing usually supports the currency. In Europe, the FTSE 100 closed 2.5% lower, while the main markets in Germany and France dropped around 2%. Major exporters such as construction equipment maker Caterpillar and plane manufacturer Boeing fell 2.5%, while Apple was among the biggest casualties, sinking 5.2%. Few sectors were left unscathed, with Nike and Macy's both seeing their respective share prices drop by around 3% each. Gold was trading at more than a six-year high on Monday, as investors put money into so-called safe haven assets. The Japanese yen and government bonds also rose as investors sought to cut back on risk. The VIX volatility index, the so-called fear measure among investors, jumped 36%. ""Any hopes of a quick resolution with China are fading quickly,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas, added: ""The escalation of trade measures only reinforces concerns over global economic growth."" Crude oil prices fell - Brent crude was down 2.5% to $60.36 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate fell 1.7%, to $54.69. The market moves come amid rising trade tension between the US and China. Chinese authorities said on Friday that they would fight back against Mr Trump's decision to impose 10% tariffs on $300bn of Chinese imports. Mr Trump's move brought an end to a month-long trade truce, which he cemented on Monday when the president started tweeting about the yuan's move. He tweeted it was ""currency manipulation"" which would ""greatly weaken China"". Based on the historic currency manipulation by China, it is now even more obvious to everyone that Americans are not paying for the Tariffs – they are being paid for compliments of China, and the U.S. is taking in tens of Billions of Dollars! China has always.... China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called “currency manipulation.” Are you listening Federal Reserve?
