1,"Gap, one of the worst-performing retailer stocks, could go lower","It could get worse for one of the worst-performing retailers, traders say. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","One of the worst-performing retail stocks this year just broke down even more. Gap shares tumbled more than 7% on Friday after CEO Art Peck stepped down and the company cut full-year earnings guidance below consensus. The stock is down more than 35% for the year, while the XRT retail ETF has climbed 8% over the same stretch. It could get worse for Gap, according to Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray. “Gap shares are just purely out of fashion at this point in time,” Johnson said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “You’re back to levels you were at in 2016 and 2011, and it doesn’t look like there’s any indication that a bottom has been made.”  The retailer is also firmly in bear market territory, having fallen nearly 50% from a March high. Shares are considered in a bear market when off more than 20% from 52-week highs. “On a relative basis, this stock has seriously lagged the overall market. If you go back to 2012, the S&P is up 143% and this stock is still at the same level it was in 2012. I’m not willing to go bottom-fishing here on this stock until there’s clear evidence of some sort of trend change starting to unfold with the shares and at this point in time, you don’t have that. I’m avoiding the shares altogether,” said Johnson. Erin Gibbs, chief investment officer at Gibbs Wealth Management, also sees Gap as a no-touch stock here. “When you really look at the fundamentals, even though the valuations are dropping, we’re looking at a 22% decline in earnings over the next 12 months. And even as far out as 2022, you’re still seeing an earnings contraction expected. So their valuation should be going down if you’re actually expecting them to make less money,” Gibbs said during the same segment. Gap posted a 15% decline in earnings in its recent quarter. For the full year, analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipate a 26% contraction in profit. Gibbs also doesn’t see the departure of Peck as a point against the company. Board Chairman Robert Fisher, son of Gap’s founders, has been named interim CEO.  Peck’s abrupt departure has raised doubts about plans to spin off Gap’s Old Navy brand. “I actually don’t see the CEO leaving as a negative thing. I think that was the one hope that they might","Nov 11, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/gap-one-of-the-worst-performing-retailer-stocks-could-go-lower.html
2,Will Southwest Airlines’ Stock Rally Continue?,Will Southwest Airlines’ Stock Rally Continue?. What’s driving LUV’s rally?. What’s ahead for Southwest Airlines stock?,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Southwest Airlines (LUV) stock has emerged as a top performer in the airline industry. With a YTD (year-to-date) return of 25.2%, the stock has outperformed broader markets and the iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT). The Dow Jones and S&P 500 have gained 18.7% and 23.4% YTD, respectively, and IYT is up 20.4%. About 20% of the ETF is allocated to the passenger airline industry. Meanwhile, Southwest’s peers have failed to keep pace with broader markets. American Airlines (AAL), the weakest, has fallen 4.2% YTD. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) have gained 15.4% and 11.6%, respectively. Southwest was battered in this year’s first half by the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX aircraft grounding. The carrier, which has 34 Boeing MAX planes, registered over 35,000 flight cancelations at a total cost of $385 million in the second and third quarters. The company expects the MAX grounding to reduce its fiscal 2019 revenue by $435 million. Nonetheless, Southwest’s back-to-back quarters of robust financial results have instilled investor confidence in the stock. In the third quarter, its revenue and earnings rose 1.1% and 13.9%, respectively, in spite of its capacity falling 2.9%. The company’s revenue per available seat mile improved 4.2% YoY (year-over-year) to $0.1432 cents in the third quarter. Its passenger yield grew 4.1%, while its load factor dropped 0.4% YoY. Analysts’ views on Southwest Airlines stock are mixed. Of the 20 analysts covering the stock, 40% suggest “buy,” 50% suggest “hold,” and 10% suggest “sell.” Their average target price of $60 implies a small upside of 3% over the next year. Analysts are more bullish on American Airlines and United. For American, 55% of analysts suggest “buy,” 30% suggest “hold,” and 15% suggest “sell” Their average target of $36.67 implies a 19% return over the next year. For United Airlines, 70% of analysts suggest “buy” and 30%” suggest “hold.” Their average target of $109.98 implies an 18% upside. Like Southwest, American and United have managed to report impressive quarterly results despite the MAX grounding. However, their stocks have failed to rally this year, which may provide investors with an investment opportunity.

4,Is American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) A Risky Investment? - Simply Wall St News,Is American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) A Risky Investment?. When Is Debt A Problem?. What Is American Airlines Group's Debt?. How,"Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for American Airlines Group As you can see below, American Airlines Group had US$24.6b of debt, at September 2019, which is about the same the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. On the flip side, it has US$5.17b in cash leading to net debt of about US$19.4b. Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that American Airlines Group had liabilities of US$19.6b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$41.5b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$5.17b and US$1.85b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$54.0b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined. This deficit casts a shadow over the US$13.5b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt At the end of the day, American Airlines Group would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment. We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it. American Airlines Group has a debt to EBITDA ratio","Nov 10, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group/news/is-american-airlines-group-nasdaqaal-a-risky-investment
5,"Motley Fool: Steady going at Southwest Airlines, this week’s trivia",". . . . . . . . . Spanish speakers are getting lost in translation at Dallas City Hall,","  BUSINESSPERSONAL FINANCE By The Motley Fool 6:00 AM on Nov 10, 2019 CST The airline industry has historically been a lousy one to invest in. It’s sensitive to the economy, capital-intensive, highly regulated and hypercompetitive. Poor management decisions have led to numerous airline bankruptcies over the years. But Dallas-based Southwest Airlines has remained profitable for 46 consecutive years — even now, despite the grounding of its 737 Max planes. This isn’t as bad as it seems: Southwest should eventually receive substantial compensation from Boeing to offset its lost profits — most likely in the form of discounts on future aircraft deliveries. And the aircraft shortage has forced Southwest to make tough choices about which markets are working and which ones aren’t.   Meanwhile, Southwest recently posted some record results in its third-quarter earnings report, with net income up 7% over year-ago levels. There’s a lot more to like about this airline. Start with its business model of simplifying by primarily using a single kind of plane — the Boeing 737 — and favoring direct point-to-point flights instead of using industry-standard hub airports for connections. Southwest’s dividend recently yielded 1.2%. It’s growing rapidly, too, having tripled over the last five years. If you can handle some volatility from the industry, give Southwest some consideration as a long-term investment. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Southwest Airlines.)

Once a brokerage has its trading technology set up, it doesn’t cost a lot to execute trades. Keep in mind, too, that trading commissions are not the brokerage’s only source of income. Like banks, brokerages get a lot of money from “net interest” — the difference in the interest rate they pay customers for cash deposits and the interest rate they earn when they invest customers’ cash. They also collect interest when investors borrow funds with which to buy stocks (“on margin”). Many brokerages these days also generate income via asset management — offering research and advice to customers.

6,Eviation’s Push to Be the Tesla of Air Travel,Eviation’s Push to Be the Tesla of Air Travel. . KEY TAKEAWAYS. What It Means for Investors. Looking Ahead. Compete,"Eviation Aircraft Ltd. is speeding ahead in an arms race to be the first to put a commercially viable electric aircraft in flight. The Israel-based startup recently secured two more customers for its nine-passenger fully electric airplane named Alice. While Alice’s first flight is being delayed until early 2020, there are now more than 150 orders for Eviation’s revolutionary aircraft, according to a recent story by Bloomberg.   Both of the new customers are American and both are recognised players in the aviation industry, said Eviation’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Omer Bar-Yohay. He declined to specify the exact names of the two customers until formal announcements are made early next year. The startup’s first commercial customer, American regional airline Cape Air, announced a “double-digit” order for Alice at the Paris Air Show back in June. Eviation is currently in talks with another potential client in Australia and Bar-Yohay has previously indicated that major U.S. carriers like United Airlines Holdings Inc. (UAL) and JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU) are also interested in the electric planes.  A lot of the interest comes from airlines looking to reduce their carbon footprint, as traditional aircraft are among the largest emitters. “We see tremendous opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of our operations,” said Cape Air founder and CEO Dan Wolf in a statement released from the airshow back in June, according to Reuters. But another huge factor is cost. Alice, which will be capable of flying 650 miles on a single charge and reach a speed of 276 mph, is expected to cost about $200 per flight hour. In comparison, a traditional turboprop plane, a plane whose turbine engine powers its propellers, costs about $1000 per flight hour, according to Bloomberg. While Alice’s first flight is expected early next year, the plane is not likely to enter service until 2022 after being certified by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Until then, Eviation will continue to look for customers and funding, of which it needs a further $500 million to enter serial production. Bar-Yohay indicated that the preferred route would be an initial public offering (IPO).

The little guys get snapped up, run out of business or, in the minority of cases, break out or carve out a nice niche for themselves. The mergers and acquisitions, M&A, space is a vital part of the capital markets, allowing companies with the proper resources to skip years or decades of building up a business, brand or product line for the right price. From the perspective of the M&A targets, these transactions can often come as a saving grace for shareholders since the acquirer almost always offers a nice premium to buy out investors. Here are seven stocks to watch that could be realistic M&A buyout targets. GoPro (ticker: GPRO) Wearable camera company GoPro, which only a few years ago was an incredibly hot IPO with growth that caught the envy of Wall Street, looks like a savvy potential M&A target for one of the Big Tech heavyweights. The reason GoPro looks primed for acquisition was highlighted recently when Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) quietly snapped up Fitbit (FIT), another wearable tech company, for just over $2 billion. Both companies are formerly high-flying tech stocks with widespread consumer brand recognition in a space all the biggest Silicon Valley firms want to dominate, if possible. GoPro, which hit all-time highs near $100 a share shortly after its IPO in 2014, now trades for under $5 a share, and just posted better than expected results. At $650 million, and with products like drones in addition to action cameras, acquiring GPRO would be pocket change for large tech players looking to add a known brand. XPO Logistics (XPO) When seeking stocks to watch in the M&A space, one useful question is: Which industries are relatively consolidated and enjoy high barriers to entry? In that respect, air delivery and freight certainly qualify, with the space dominated historically by FedEx Corp. (FDX) and UPS (UPS), followed by everyone else.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Peter Wells in New York Boeing expects to take a step foward with the US aviation regulator in January that might pave the way for the subsequent return to commercial service of its 737 Max jet, which had been grounded this year following two fatal crashes. The company said it was also “possible” it could resume deliveries of the jet to customers in December, but added that this was still dependent on approval and certifications from the Federal Aviation Authority and other regulators. The update comes just days after some of the company’s biggest customers pushed back their expected start dates for recommencing commercial flights using the aircraft. Investors nonetheless welcomed the update and lifted Boeing shares more than 5 per cent higher, putting them on course for their largest one-day jump in more than five months. Boeing has previously indicated deliveries of its troubled jet could resume later this year. For the purposes of its third-quarter results, released in October, Boeing said at time it assumed regulatory approval of the 737 Max returning to service “begins in the fourth quarter of 2019”. The resumption of such deliveries by airline customers rests on certification and when the FAA decides to rescind the 737 Max grounding order, which has been in place since March this year following the fatal crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. “In parallel, we are working towards final validation of the updated training requirements, which must occur before the Max returns to commercial service, and which we now expect to begin in January,” Boeing said in its statement on Monday. The training evaluation represents the final of five milestones the company must complete with the FAA before the 737 Max can return to service. According to its November 11 statement, the company has completed only the first of the five requirements, which is a simulator evaluation and certification of the jet’s software systems. Southwest Airlines, which operated the largest 737 Max fleet in the US, on November 8 said it expected to resume scheduled commercial flights of the aircraft on March 6 — a month later than its previous forecast. American Airlines, which operated the second-largest US-based 737 Max fleet, acted similarly. It expects scheduled flights to resume on March 5 versus its previous prediction of January 5.

By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment When Nobel Prize-winning economist and Yale professor Robert Shiller says there are “bubbles everywhere” in today’s market, it pays to listen up. He cautioned that the impressive returns investors have been enjoying over the past few years are likely coming to an end, saying he expects U.S. stocks to return an average of just 4.4% each year over the next 30. Shiller says that in addition to the stock market, bubbles are also present in the bond market and the U.S. housing market. As investors search for any indication that a stock market crash is on the horizon, here’s a look at Shiller’s assessment.   Shiller’s not the only one concerned about a U.S. housing market bubble— the number of experts waving caution flags has increased dramatically over the past month. Some point to falling new home sales despite tight inventory as a sign that the housing market is already starting to crash. Fannie Mae’s October sentiment indicator showed a 2.7 point decline, suggesting that Americans are starting to worry about shelling out for a new home. A research report by online real estate firm Zillow showed that nearly half of the real estate experts and economists it polled saw a housing market recession hitting the U.S. in 2020.  He’s also not alone in his assessment of the bond market, where skittish investors have piled in looking for a safe income stream.

15,Can Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) Shares Relive The Glory Days?,. . Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) Growth and Momentum Builds. POSITIVE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SIGNS. CAN REGENERON SHARES RELIVE THE GLORY DAYS?.,"  Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), the New York biotech giant, released Q3 earnings before the bell on Tuesday morning that sent the stock flying. It gapped up 4% on the report to start the day and was soon trading up 10% from Monday’s close. Numbers-wise, revenue, and EPS beat estimates across the board. The former in particular printing an impressive +27% YOY number and the latter printing +13% YOY. The company highlighted strong sales growth across two key products as the cornerstone of the quarter’s success. US net sales from EYLEA continued their march higher into $1 billion territory, posting a 16% jump compared to the same quarter last year. Any fears of generic competition from Novartis appear unfounded for now and the macular degeneration treatment is gaining substantial market share. The company’s other flagship product is Dupixent and its sales growth was even better. Global net sales jumped over 140% YOY, largely driven by Regeneron’s ongoing collaboration with fellow pharma giant Sanofi on the product. In August the European Commission approved extending the drug’s use to adolescents, a move that will surely bear fruit with sales figures next quarter. If the positive momentum and growth in the fundamentals weren’t enough to make investors sing and dance, then management’s announcement of a $1 billion share repurchase program surely did. These are often initiated by a company’s management who think their stock might be undervalued. Buybacks by their nature increase the demand and reduce the supply of shares so they tend to lend themselves to sustained periods of upward momentum in a stock. But that’s not all investors have to look forward to. Regeneron is a company that was founded and is led by physician-scientists. They have a solid track record in drug development and investors should be excited about every one of the 24 products they have in clinical development. Their on-going trials range from oncology medicines to cardiovascular treatments to pain management, with plenty in between. It’s safe to say they have a very diversified pipeline which should help investors sleep at night. This is not a one-trick pony biotech whose future is riding on positive results from a Phase 1 trial. This is important because the stock has lagged the overall market and investors would be forgiven for getting impatient. While the S&P 500 can boast a 30% rally so far this year, Regeneron shares were down 16% going","Nov 11, 2019",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/regeneron-nasdaq-regn-growth-and-momentum-builds/

Qantas. RELATED. Start-up behind Qantas' carbon offsets raises $9m. . READ MORE.","Qantas Airways' ambitious carbon emissions plan has received the backing of investors, who pushed the airline to a fresh all-time high on the ASX. The company's share price hit $6.87 in morning trading on Monday to beat the previous $6.83 peak, recorded in August last year. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline was recognising its role in the fight against catastrophic climate change. AAP The share price ended the session at $6.82, a jump of 1.6 per cent jump on the company's previous close. Though the advance came as the overall market rallied, it followed the airline's announcement of a new roadmap designed to slash carbon emissions. Qantas pledged a $50 million investment in sustainable fuel sources over the next decade as part of the plan. Other big-ticket items included a cap on net carbon emissions by next year and a significant expansion of the company's carbon offset program. The plan was ""a positive indication they are attempting to address the issue"", White Funds Management's Angus Gluskie said. But the promises focused on the far off future. ""They are attempting to be proactive, but it's difficult to do much tangible now when the critical developments needed may take decades to come to fruition,'' he said. Qantas' headline commitment to net-zero carbon emissions has a 2050 schedule. Yet this timeline is consistent with other businesses aiming to reduce their carbon footprint. Chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline was recognising its role in the fight against catastrophic climate change. ""We've already made some good progress, especially by investing in newer aircraft that have a much smaller carbon footprint,"" he said. ""We want to do more, and faster."" The plan applies to Qantas' leading brand, as well as its budget offshoot Jetstar, regional service QantasLink, and freighter business Qantas Freight. The airline, overall, emitted more than 12.4 million tonnes of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere during the 2019 financial year from its direct operations. Qantas' scope three emissions – those produced through the company's value chain or indirectly – stood at 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions during the same period. The company's output is just a part of the 2 per cent contribution the aviation sector makes to global CO2 emissions, a figure the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identified in 2014. ""Concerns about emissions and climate change are real, but we can't lose sight of the contribution that","Nov 11, 2019",https://www.afr.com/companies/transport/qantas-soars-to-all-time-high-20191111-p539gh
