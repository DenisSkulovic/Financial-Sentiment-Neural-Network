Hopes for a new round of","   Wednesday was another strong day for the stock market, lifted in large part by favorable earnings results among favorite companies. Moreover, market participants continue to be optimistic that a COVID-19 vaccine could help things get back to normal sooner rather than later. By the end of the trading day, gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) outpaced those of other indexes, but the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite posted rises as well. Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow +1.39% +373 S&P 500 +0.64% +21 Nasdaq Composite +0.52% +57 DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. Notable among gainers were shares of airline companies. Good news on the coronavirus front has obvious implications for airlines, but the financial challenges that these companies face remain difficult to overcome. News that carriers might get some more support from the federal government helped lift investor sentiment on Wednesday, but the money could be a two-edged sword for current shareholders. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The gains for airline stocks were impressive. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) was by far the best performer, climbing almost 10% on the day. Other stocks also saw sizable gains: The gains built on rising stock prices from Tuesday. Those earlier advances came on the heels of favorable data on traffic from the Transportation Security Administration, which reported that travel volumes continue to bounce back from their spring lows during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wednesday's rise for airline stocks comes as industry executives have asked for further help from the federal government. Initial bailout packages came with strings that forced airlines to keep their workforces largely intact through the end of September. The hope at the time was that a six-month window would be enough for things to return to normal. It's now clear that the initial assessment was too optimistic. In particular, lawmakers are strongly considering adding provisions to expected fiscal stimulus packages that would extend additional money to airlines in exchange for longer timelines of keeping workers on board. One proposal would add another $25 billion to the roughly $50 billion previous package, and most expect that airlines would have to agree not to let workers go for an additional three to six months. What's uncertain, though, is just how much airlines would support such efforts. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly is on record supporting the move, joining United and American. But most airlines have already","Aug 5, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/05/airlines-send-stock-markets-climbing-but-is-more-b.aspx
1,Winners and Losers Are Emerging in Airline Stocks | Barron's,Winners and Losers Are Emerging in Airline Stocks. . . READ MORE. Here’s BofA’s List of 4 Enterprise Software Stocks,"    Shares of Spirit Airlines have surged more than 9%, after the carrier said it could furlough up to 30% of its staff this fall. The news and Tuesday’s move for the stock seem to fit a pattern. With demand looking weaker, investors want to see airlines cut costs dramatically, and carriers that do so may be rewarded with higher share prices. Spirit (ticker: SAVE) said in a filing on Monday that an increase in demand it saw in June and July has since reversed due to the rise in coronavirus cases and state-imposed quarantines.  “It’s now clear that the demand increase we saw in June was an outlier, and the downward trend will continue,” Spirit said in a memo to employees last week. The airline now expects flight capacity to be down 35% in August and 45% in September. That represents a deterioration from July when the airline’s capacity was off 18% from the same period a year earlier. The airline has now burned through more than $700 million in cash in the last five months and expects to go through another $100 million each month for the next several months, it said. “This level of cash burn is not sustainable,” Spirit said. The upshot is that Spirit warned employees that it may furlough 20% to 30% of pilots, flight attendants, and other staff in October, after payroll support it is receiving under the Cares Act expires. Spirit’s second-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street’s expectations, and its stock has taken investors on a roller-coaster ride. The stock plunged to a low of $7 a share on March 19, hit a high of $25.94 on June 5, and has since settled back to around $16.80. Spirit has been one of the strongest performers relative to its low point, gaining more than 137%. While every airline stock is down by double digits this year, there are some stark contrasts. Low-cost carriers focused on the leisure market are generally outperforming the full-service legacy airlines. And with demand trends now looking shakier, due to the rise in virus cases and quarantine measures, investors are focusing on carriers that may be able to cut costs fastest. One of the sharpest contrasts in the charts is between Allegiant Travel (ALGT) and United Airlines (UAL)—the best and worst performers year to date. Allegiant is down 36% this year versus a 63%","Aug 5, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/winners-and-losers-are-emerging-in-airline-stocks-51596559300

4,Airline Stocks Could Charge Higher in Short Covering Rally,Airline Stocks Could Charge Higher in Short Covering Rally. . KEY TAKEAWAYS. . . The Bottom Line. Compete Risk Free,"Airlines could blast higher in a summer rally that shakes out short sellers and rewards well-timed long positions. The uptick may not reach June highs, when air carriers were trading more than 40% above current levels, but the buying spike could be worth the considerable risk of owning these hot potatoes. Just keep in mind that this optimism isn't intended as an ""all-clear"" signal because one or more of these fallen giants could eventually go bankrupt or be forced to merge. Major carriers have now dropped into weekly oversold technical readings after steady downticks that are now probing early June price levels. At the same time, TSA checkpoint travel numbers have risen to the highest levels since the shutdown started in March. Curve-flattening now underway in the states affected by the summer COVID-19 spike could ignite this potent combination, with short-term optimism underpinning sector buying interest. Of course, these companies face major challenges in coming months, with high odds for a second wave of the pandemic that keeps folks close to home until the second quarter of 2021, at the earliest. In addition, Asian and European destinations remain off-limits to American travelers due to our high infection rates, generating a secondary headwind that could delay an airline industry renaissance. Even so, short sellers may have overplayed their hands in this summer tape, setting up ideal conditions for a painful squeeze. Short selling is an investment or trading strategy that speculates on the decline in a stock or other security's price. It is an advanced strategy that should only be undertaken by experienced traders and investors. The US Global Jets ETF (JETS) topped out in the first quarter of 2018 and entered a broad topping pattern, with support in the mid-$20s. It broke down in February 2020, entering a vertical slide that dumped the sector fund to $11.25, the lowest low since it came public in 2015. A bounce into the end of March stalled above $18, giving way to a successful May test at the deep low. That set the stage for a double bottom reversal that generated a four-week 100% rally into $22.10. The fund has ticked lower in a gravity wave for the past two months, posting four lows into this week's low near $15, which has aligned with the .618 Fibonacci rally retracement level.

6,Coronavirus: Airline stocks soar after GOP senators push for $25 billion in additional industry aid,Airline stocks soar after GOP senators push for $25 billion in additional industry aid. Many workers already left. News Tips.,"More than a dozen Republican senators on Wednesday backed $25 billion in additional federal aid for the airline industry as a spike in coronavirus cases in the U.S. in recent weeks derailed a nascent recovery in travel demand. The news sent shares sharply higher Wednesday afternoon. American Airlines’ stock closed up 9.5%, after trading as much as 12% higher on the day. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines added more than 4% and 3%, respectively. The added GOP support increases the likelihood that the funds get included in the next big aid package to help the U.S. weather the impact of the pandemic. More than 200 House lawmakers have already backed the extension, which would preserve jobs until the end of March 2021. The endorsement from GOP senators in the Republican-controlled Senate puts pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to include the provision in a final aid package.  U.S. passenger airlines were allocated $25 billion in aid, mostly in grants, that would preserve sector jobs through Sept. 30, but carriers have told more than 70,000 workers that their jobs are at risk after that deadline passes. Meanwhile, travel demand remains at a fraction of last year’s levels and financial losses at airlines are mounting. Executives say a demand recovery to 2019 levels could take years and that appetite for air travel will be limited barring a coronavirus vaccine. “For these reasons, we support a clean extension of payroll support for passenger air carrier employees included in the CARES Act to avoid furloughs and further support those workers,” the 16 Republican senators wrote in a letter, which was seen by CNBC, to McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The letter was signed by Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., Todd Young, R-Ind., Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, and others. The senators also urged Congress to consider support for other aviation-related businesses like concessionaires and aircraft producers. “Such businesses and their workers are uniquely tethered to air travel and have been and will continued to be significantly impacted by the decline in air travel,” they wrote. Boeing shares rose 5.6% on Wednesday while its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which makes fuselages and other parts, added nearly 9%. Labor unions had been urging Congress to extend the airline aid since June and CEOs of some of the largest U.S. carriers have recently said they","Aug 5, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/coronavirus-aid-package-senators-push-for-billions-more-in-airline-aid.html
7,RYAAY: 4 Airline Stocks That Actually ASCENDED in July,4 Airline Stocks That Actually ASCENDED in July. . . About the Author: Patrick Ryan. More Resources for the Stocks,"  RYAAY – July was a tough month for airline stocks as case counts spiked, economic improvements stalled, and travel data showed positive trends reversed. However, ZNH, RYAAY, ALGT, and VLRS bucked these trends and finished the month higher. Aug 4, 2020  Airline investors have been burned this year for obvious reasons. The airline stocks experienced a strong bounce from mid-May to early June as case counts were declining and economies were reopening. However, recent developments have made it clear that the near-future is going to remain challenging for the sector. Though airline stocks pose a considerable risk, there are certainly some opportunities worth considering on a short and long-term basis. 7 ""SAFE HAVEN"" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent Times It may take air travel years to return to its pre-COVID levels. For the airlines that can survive this downturn, they will thrive as weaker companies will go out of business, and there will be less competition. In the short-term, some parts of the world are recovering, and life is returning to normal, so these stocks have the potential to keep climbing higher. So, it’s interesting to note that some airline stocks bucked the industry trend and increased in value this past July. Those stocks are as follows: Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), China Southern Airlines Company (ZNH), Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT) and Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion (VLRS). Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) Most Americans know little-to-nothing about RYAAY simply because the airlines operate outside of the United States. Now and then you will see RYAAY pop up in a story, typically highlighting the company’s penny-pinching ways. However, RYAAY pinches pennies for good reason to give its customers the cheapest flights in Europe. The airline provides unbeatably low airfares and efficient service throughout Ireland, the United Kingdom, Morocco, and Continental Europe. The POWR Ratings reveal RYAAY has an A Peer Grade, a B Trade Grade, a solid Buy & Hold Grade, and an overall ranking of #1 out of more than 22 Airline stocks. TipRanks analysts’ ratings of RYAAY put the stock’s price target at $90, indicating there is more than 20% upside to go. It is hard to believe RYAAY is up to $20 from its March sell-off low of $47. Though the stock has not returned to its pre-COVID trading level of $90 to $100, it has displayed considerable strength while most other airlines have struggled to remain in business.","Aug 4, 2020",https://stocknews.com/news/ryaay-znh-algt-vlrs-4-airline-stocks-up-in-july/
8,Soaring Southwest Airlines Stock Will Stay Sector Leader | InvestorPlace,Soaring Southwest Airlines Stock Will Stay Sector Leader. LUV stock has been the best-performing airlines and its balance sheet should," Are airline stocks back? Well, it might be a leap to say that much. However, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and its peers may have already seen the lows. If that’s the case, investors are now wondering whether LUV stock can continue to lead the group. Over the past month, LUV stock is down 12.56%, which is about in-line with its peers. It only “lags” — if you can call it that — Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), both down 12.2%. It slightly lags these two over the past three months too, with Southwest stock down about 1%. However, that’s much better than Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), which are down 9.75% and 13.5%, respectively. Over the longer term though, Southwest has done much better than its peers. So far on the year, Southwest stock is down 43%. While terrible, that’s almost 15 percentage points better than the next best performer (out of the five major airlines),  Delta, down 57.8%. Over the past year, the outperformance widens even more. Again, Southwest and Delta are No. 1 and No. 2 at -42% and -60.5%, respectively. Southwest Airlines did not report good results in late July. Despite beating both profit and sales estimates, the company lost $2.67 per share and experienced an 83% decline in revenue. Those are some sizable declines and it will take time for Southwest to recover from the novel coronavirus. 3 STOCKS TO BUY NOW FOR THE END OF CASH The company lost more than $900 million in the quarter and the hope for a sustainable recovery is losing steam. This is from chairman and CEO Gary Kelly (emphasis added): “As our Nation continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for air travel remains weak, which was the driver of our second quarter net loss of approximately $1.5 billion, excluding special items. We were encouraged by improvements in May and June leisure passenger traffic trends, compared with March and April; however, the improving trends in revenue and bookings have recently stalled in July with the rise in COVID-19 cases.” However, this is what has always made and continues to make LUV stock the best of the bunch: “We have strong liquidity, with cash and short-term investments of $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2020; the only investment-grade credit rating in the U.S. airline industry by all three agencies.” The company’s balance sheet continues","Aug 4, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/soaring-southwest-airlines-stock-will-stay-sector-leader/
9,AAL Stock: 2 Reasons Why American Airlines Stock Is One to Sell | InvestorPlace,2 Reasons Why American Airlines Stock Is One to Sell. No deal means no good reason to own AAL stock.," At one point in the post-pandemic period, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and its competitors appeared to offer a solid contrarian case. And while the novel coronavirus was still infecting people, daily cases, hospitalizations and deaths had declined. Subsequently, air traveler confidence improved, based on the dramatic surge in demand from the March and April doldrums. But again, we find ourselves questioning the upside narrative for AAL stock.  Not surprisingly, the coronavirus is at the center of the current underperformance of the airline industry. And according to several health experts, the U.S. reopened too soon. Curiously, though, more than a few epidemiologists were pounding the table on this argument back in early May. That must have been “fake news,” though. Unfortunately, this fake news is now all too real for AAL stock. It’s an incredibly frustrating one from all involved — from the executives to the employees to the shareholders. Overall, while I don’t want to be the bearer of more bad news, I also have to be realistic: This is an ugly situation. Primarily, I say this because AAL stock responds to discernibly positive headlines. Take a look at these examples: But since then, the news cycle for encouraging headlines faded. And sadly, I’m not getting a great look as we now turned the page to August. In a parallel universe, both Republicans and Democrats will sit down at the table and come to one patently obvious conclusion: if we don’t do something and quick, the U.S. will fail. And Americans of all stripes will recognize that it doesn’t matter who wins the 2020 election if we lose the stability that we have fought for across generations to earn. However, we don’t live in that universe. So, let the politics begin and let everyone else die, I suppose. Additionally, as you’ve undoubtedly heard, the eviction moratorium has ended. In turn, this has left 43 million Americans at risk of losing their place of residence. Also, unemployed workers have lost the so-called $600 “plus up” — a federal program designed to bolster state unemployment benefits during this unprecedented crisis. That said, this will probably set off a chain reaction as the economic pain filters out to every sector.

How to play Air,"      Joey Frenette | August 5, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) and other airline stocks may not be Warren Buffett’s cup of tea amid this pandemic. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be yours, especially if you’re a young investor who has a better understanding of the industry and a greater tolerance for the high risks (and volatility) involved with an investment at these depths. I wouldn’t write off Air Canada or any of its air travel peers south of the border. While you’re probably well aware of the risks involved with betting on airline stocks in a pandemic (there’s a chance that you could lose your shirt!), the real question you should be asking yourself is if you’re strong enough to hold onto shares once the next round of turbulence hits. You see, airline stocks could skyrocket on the arrival of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. Many health experts see a vaccine arriving at some point next year. So, if you’re going to make money as an investor off an airline stock such as Air Canada, you need the stomach to deal with potentially another year (or more) of off-the-charts volatility. While you could make big money by trading Air Canada, I think that such a short-term-focused mindset will lead most people towards potentially steep losses. Sure, you could buy the stock with the intention of ditching it after the next good news story for the airlines. But I think a majority of the upside will be taken by strong-stomached investors who are willing to hang on for the next few years. As long as the coronavirus is still causing outbreaks across a wide range of geographies, the airlines will be stuck in a rut, and quarterly losses could send Air Canada stock and its peers tanking by default, perhaps en route to default. As I’ve noted in prior pieces, any significant rallies are likely to be unsustainable until there’s a vaccine that can eliminate the novel coronavirus. Moreover, I also highlighted that any technical bottom would be unlikely to hold without a constant stream of good news relating to the development of a vaccine to keep shares afloat. If you’re willing to watch your Air Canada investment fall by double-digit percentage points, potentially en route to the single-digits, only then do you have the pain tolerance to improve your chances of","Aug 5, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/05/air-canada-tsxac-stocks-rally-could-be-epic/

The Making,"TAKE OUR FREE COURSES TRY US FREE FOR 14 DAYS Recommended Tools MASTER PRICE ACTION Can you buy Virgin Airlines stock? With a net worth of $4.2 billion dollars, all self-made, Sir Richard Branson got his start in the mail-order record business over 50 years ago. It's certainly worth a deep dive with all the issues affecting airlines! He owes his fortune to several companies bearing the ""Virgin"" name, including Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Galactic. There's no doubt about it, Branson is wildly successful, which is why many investors want to buy Virgin Airlines stock.  Thirty-six years ago, Richard Branson was hot, sweaty and stuck on a hot tarmac trying to get out of Puerto Rico for the British Virgin Islands. Needless to say, he was over it. With his flight grounded and missing his girlfriend, he decided to take matters into his own hands.   What would any so-called ""sensible"" person do in this situation? In my case, I would resign myself to a lifetime of being stuck on a plane, order another drink and wait. Not that creative of me, is it?   For those of you who are nodding in agreement (you know who you are), Branson would put us to shame. In the true entrepreneurial spirit, he literally figured out how much it would cost to charter a plane to the Virgin Islands. Armed with that information, he went with it. Branson acquired a chalkboard, crunched the numbers and wrote, ""$39 one way each to BVI."" And that my friend was Virgin Atlantic's very first flight. After his success, he decided to call Boeing to ask if he could buy a secondhand 747. Sure, why not? Boeing asked which company he was with.

14,GOP Senators Support More Money for Airlines to Pay Workers – NBC4 Washington,"GOP Senators Support More Money for Airlines to Pay Workers. In March, aviation companies got $32 billion to help cover","A group of 16 Republican senators has endorsed giving more money to airlines to avoid layoffs right before the November election, giving a boost to a lobbying effort by airlines and their unions.

No lawmakers have spoken out against the airline provision, although aides say some object to helping workers in one industry when there are millions of other workers who have already lost their jobs during the pandemic. Air travel isn't expected to return to previous levels for several years — not until 2024, according to a trade group for global airlines — leading some industry observers to say airlines should be allowed to shrink to match lower demand, even if it means fewer jobs. Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, responded by calling the airline provision the most successful jobs program in the $2.2 trillion virus-relief measure approved in","Aug 5, 2020",https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/gop-senators-support-more-money-for-airlines-to-pay-workers/2382981/
