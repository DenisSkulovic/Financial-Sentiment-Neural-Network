0,Warren Buffet was Right About Selling Entire US Airline Stocks,Warren Buffet was Right About Selling Entire US Airline Stocks. Most Recent News. First Direct Commercial Flight from Israel to," By Amanda Collins Warren Buffet, in a shocking move, dumped all his airline stocks in April, taking a hit of approximately $5 billion resulting in significant losses for his airlines' portfolio. Critics argued that the shutdown was temporary, and air travel demand would bounce back. Shares even regained the lost value by May, prompting many to call Mr. Buffet’s decision unwise. Even the CARES Act was designed, keeping six months in mind, after which travel demand was expected to pick-up. Four months after the sell-off, the aviation industry is in a deeper crisis, and looks like Warren Buffet was right. Air travel demand has barely picked up, cases are skyrocketing, so are deaths, and Americans are banned from visiting most countries. Though several vaccine candidates are at advanced stages, it would be at least December to know if the most promising vaccine by Moderna even qualifies for mass usage. All these are factors that are continuing to hurt air travel from getting back to any levels of normalcy. Read: Business Travelers are Key to Airline Recovery. Will They Return? For decades, Warren Buffet would not touch airline stocks after he lost money in the 1980s. It was only in 2016, he started buying and eventually owning between 7.6% - 10% of shares in each of the US airlines - American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines, which was combinedly worth $4 billion in Dec 2019. He argued that the airlines had way too many planes and an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible outcomes from the pandemic for the selloff. Here are seven reasons why Warren Buffet’s sell-off makes sense now: 1) Recovery is not as happening as fast as expected Most of the world expected that few months of lockdown would control the spread of the virus, and things would be back to normal. It is the exact opposite that is happening now. US death toll stands at 168,000, according to John Hopkins University. Continued lockdowns and restrictions are hampering economic activity resulting in delayed meaningful recovery. 2) The approved vaccine does not reverse passenger demand to 2019 levels Getting a vaccine to work and securing approval is one thing. Getting all citizens vaccinated is yet another logistical nightmare. A vaccine takes a minimum of 6 years to develop under normal circumstances, but given the exceptional situation, approvals and trials are expedited. It would take a","Aug 15, 2020",https://www.rateacabincrew.com/blog/post/warren-buffet-was-right-about-selling-entire-us-airline-stocks

The move, which affects some 160,000 British holidaymakers currently in France according to official estimates, will take effect on Saturday.

DAILY EMAIL. . . . . .","Airline stocks have tumbled after the UK government imposed quarantine rules on people arriving from France, Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba. Around 160,000 British holidaymakers currently in France have until 4am tomorrow morning to get back home if they wish to avoid having to quarantine for 14 days upon their return. It comes after France’s prime minister admitted the country’s coronavirus infection numbers were going ‘the wrong way’, while France also warned it would take ‘reciprocal measures’ on people arriving from the UK. British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, with its shares dropping 6.4% to 191p, while in the FTSE 250 budget airline EasyJet (EZJ) fell 7.2% to 566p and tour operator TUI (TUI) dropped 5.7% to 325p, having already fallen significantly yesterday. Though EasyJet’s share price fall also comes after it completed a sale and leaseback programme for 23 aircraft, in a sign of how much uncertainty there is in the aviation industry at the moment. The sale and leaseback generated a total of £608 million, towards the upper end of EasyJet’s previously guided range of £500-650 million. Ryanair (RYA) shares dropped 4.6% to €11.54 on the news with fellow budget airline Wizz Air (WIZZ), which is more focused on Central and Eastern Europe, down just 2% to £35.72. Jet2 owner Dart Group (DTG:AIM) was also a sizeable faller, with its shares down 6.3% to 689p. ‘SUMMER 2020 A WRITE OFF’ AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said, ‘The problem for the airlines is that people’s desire for a break in the sun may be outweighed by their fear of the logistical challenges of holing up for two weeks when they get back, with decisions on which countries to add to the quarantine list often coming at short notice. ‘This decision will feel particularly painful as it comes at the height of the UK holiday season and the question now becomes just how long the likes of EasyJet, Ryanair and British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines can continue under these conditions. ‘It appears summer 2020 will be something of a write off, the industry cannot afford for the same to be true in 12 months. ‘And yet until there is a vaccine, the recovery from the coronavirus is likely to be patchy with the risk of travel restrictions between countries when there are localised flare ups.’  @SharesMagJames:","Aug 14, 2020",https://www.sharesmagazine.co.uk/news/shares/airline-stocks-tumble-on-france-quarantine-plans

Buffett’s,"      Ryan Vanzo | August 14, 2020 | More on: BRK-A BRK-B AC Warren Buffett has had a strange 2020. Just look at his position on airlines. For decades he refused to invest in the industry. Airlines have been “a disaster for capital” he once said. But by 2019, he was a leading shareholder of four different airlines. What changed? “They’re like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way. The hope is they will keep orders in reasonable relationship to potential demand,” he explained. Then the coronavirus hit. Every airline stock was crushed. “This is hundreds of times worse than 9/11, SARS, or the global financial crisis — quite frankly combined,” stressed Air Canada (TSX:AC) CEO Calin Rovinescu. How did Buffett react? “I won’t be selling airline stocks,” he revealed in March. “It’s going to be terrible,” he added, but it “won’t stop the progress of the country or the world.” Apparently, things change. Within months of making those statements, Buffett exited his airlines bets entirely. That’s a strange move for a revered long-term thinker. Despite his public optimism, the Oracle of Omaha has looked quite bearish in recent months. His airline divestment was only the start. Buffett is never one for timing the market, but he does have one indicator that he uses to gauge market frothiness. He calls it “The best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.” “The gauge takes the combined market capitalizations of publicly traded stocks worldwide and divides it by global gross domestic product,” explains Markets Insider. “A reading of more than 100% suggests that the global stock market is overvalued relative to the world economy.” This indicator has recently soared towards an all-time high, for both the U.S. and the world. As we’ll see, this may be driving Buffett’s cautiousness to invest. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B), has billions in the bank. Many expected him to deploy this cash when the coronavirus correction began. Surprisingly, he remained largely on the sidelines, even though he repeated his calls for long-term bullishness. This week, we learned what he truly thinks of the stock market. “Warren Buffett seems to have repurchased more than $7 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock in the last three months,” reports Markets Insider. “Buffett’s buybacks highlight his willingness to tap Berkshire’s $147 billion in cash reserves and","Aug 14, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/14/warren-buffett-screams-dont-buy-the-stock-market/
5,3 Reasons I'll Never Sell Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . 3 Reasons I’ll Never Sell Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock. The worst already,"      Jitendra Parashar | August 14, 2020 | More on: AC The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic — which started earlier this year in China — has brought at least hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the globe to the verge of collapsing. As the virus started spreading outside China, most countries started taking unprecedented measures, including the closures of businesses and international borders. These measures not only made small businesses suffer, but many flourishing large companies also faced a severe crisis and are still struggling to recover. As a result, the shares of these large publicly listed companies crashed like never before, and who knows it better than loyal investors of Air Canada (TSX:AC)? Air Canada stock was at its all-time high — exactly seven months ago — on January 14. Since then, the stock has crashed by about 70%. While I don’t deny the severity of the ongoing crisis, I’ll give you my three solid reasons never to sell Air Canada’s stock. As the COVID-19 started hurting the airline industry, even Warren Buffett — one of the greatest investors of our times — seemingly panicked and sold all his airline stocks. It’s interesting because he usually preaches that new investors avoid selling stocks in a panic, which is completely opposite to what he actually did this time. If an investor like Buffett — who has spent all his life investing in stocks — can panic sell all his airline stocks, I wonder how other investors might have passed through this tough phase. Nonetheless, Air Canada investors need to understand that it’s an industry-wide crisis that airlines are facing globally. So, you shouldn’t be blaming Air Canada for it. Before 2020, Air Canada’s fundamentals were largely showcasing a positive trend and multiple signs of its improving financial condition. Between 2015 and 2019, its total annual revenue rose by about 38%. Therefore, even if I would ever want to sell any airline stock, it certainly wouldn’t be Air Canada. Also, with declining COVID-19 cases across North America, the worst already might be over for Air Canada investors. We shouldn’t forget the fact that Air Canada is not just any airline company; its Canada’s flag carrier and the country’s largest airline. With the way the Justin Trudeau administration has swiftly been trying to fix the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 so far, there are good chances","Aug 14, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/14/3-reasons-ill-never-sell-air-canada-tsxac-stock/
6,Why It May Finally Be Time to Buy DAL Stock Despite Weak Travel Trends | InvestorPlace,"Is It Finally Time to Buy Delta Stock? . DAL stock will suffer from short-term volatility, but long-term gains are"," Airline stocks are flirting with a possible rotation higher and that’s got investors taking a closer look at this group. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is one of the better-run names in the industry, so we want a piece of DAL stock if there’s going to be a big run.   The question is, will there be a big run in airline stocks, or is this just a quick squeeze higher?  As a group, airline stocks began to break down in May, reversed, and then surged in June. Since then, they have been back under pressure. I have started to take a closer look at the group and have found several names compelling.  While a short-term surge like we saw in June would be nice to pad the old “P&L” line, I think there is a long-term opportunity here with this group.  Delta has gone to great lengths to make its passengers feel safe on its flights. That includes no middle seat, limited capacity, mandatory masks on the flight, deep cleaning, and high-rate air filtration, among other things. That said, customers are still not coming back in droves — to Delta or any other airline.  Coronavirus cases have remained elevated even though they are off the peak. The U.S. has averaged more than 1,000 deaths per day through the first 12 days of August. I’m not here to get political, just to hit the facts.  With tens of thousands of new cases per day and 1,000-plus deaths, that’s going to have an impact on the travel industry. We’ve seen that impact via TSA checkpoint numbers.  Traffic bounced back impressively from the April lows. However, it plateaued in July and while investors bid up airline stocks upon seeing the best post-coronavirus travel number from the TSA, that momentum is again beginning to wane.  YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE Like a stock chart, that big travel number is potentially a leading indicator to a larger trend. However, it could also be a blip on the radar; a head fake. We’ll find out over the next few weeks and months.  One thing that is already certain is that we’re still down big year-over-year.

Berkshire Hathaway's chief kicked a number,"Getty Images After pretty much laying low in the first three months of the year, Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), made sweeping changes to its stock portfolio during the second quarter. Most notably, he continued to sell off equities. After dumping shares in 19 positions during the first quarter, Warren Buffett fully exited seven positions and sold off parts of another 11 stakes. But he was a little more active on the buying side, too, adding to four positions and initiating a stake in a company that's well outside of his traditional wheelhouse. The Oracle of Omaha has made a few other interesting moves of late, too. That includes finally putting Berkshire's massive cash pile to use in a $9.7 billion buyout of Dominion Energy's (D) midstream energy business – his biggest deal in years – and a big bet on himself. Of course, we know what the greatest long-term investor of all time has been doing because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires all investment managers with more than $100 million in assets to file a Form 13F quarterly to disclose any changes in share ownership. These filings add an important level of transparency to the stock market and give Buffett-ologists a chance to get a bead on what he's thinking. When Buffett starts a new stake in some company, or adds to an existing one, investors read into that as a vote of confidence. But if he pares his holdings in a stock, it can spark investors to rethink their own investments. The fact that Berkshire Hathaway continued to shed weight even as the market began to rebound in Q2 underscores how challenging it is to make investing decisions these days. Here's the scorecard for what Warren Buffett was buying and selling during the three months ended June 30, 2020, based on the most recent 13F that the company filed on Aug. 14. And remember: Not all ""Warren Buffett stocks"" are actually his picks.

U.S. equities were mixed on Friday as the S&P 500 continued to hover below its record high from February. Electric car company Tesla continued to climb after two Wall Street firms upgraded the stock. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose for the third consecutive month, though the increase was smaller-than-expected when accounting for automobiles.  Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari renewed his call for an economic shutdown, telling CNBC on Friday that it’s the only hope for arresting the Covid-19 spread and getting the economy back on track. In a recent op-ed for the New York Times, Kashkari and economics professor Michael T. Osterholm of the University of Minnesota argued that the country should do a full lockdown for up to six weeks. “We blew it the first time ... we should do it right this time,” the central bank official said on “Closing Bell.” Kashkari added that the coronavirus strain is “raging out of control,” posing health risks and limiting Americans’ ability to engage in activities like watching college football. “What kind of a recovery is that?” he said. — Jeff Cox Stocks finished Friday’s session mixed with the Dow gaining 34 points, or 0.12%, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 fell 0.21% and 0.02%, respectively.

Keeping business secure in the age of,"August 15, 2020 12:56 AM GMT+3         Airlines weren't the only stocks Warren Buffett soured on during the pandemic. In addition to selling all his airline holdings including Delta and Southwest, which Buffett announced in May, the Berkshire Hathaway investor also dumped his bank stocks, closing his position in Goldman Sachs completely. Indeed, Buffett did far more selling than buying between April and June, as Berkshire's quarterly shareholder filing, released Friday afternoon, made clear. As the coronavirus crisis escalated, the celebrated investor added just a single new stock to his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio: Barrick Gold, a Canada-based mining company whose stock price loosely trades in tandem with the price of gold—which has surged this year (up nearly 30%) as investors have sought safe havens. Barrick itself has outperformed the precious metal, with its shares up 45% so far in 2020. Buffett's Barrick stock is currently worth about $565 million. Buffett clearly jumped to pull out of stocks most hurt by the coronavirus-related shutdowns. He also sold all his shares in Restaurant Brands International, the owner of fast food restaurants including Burger King and Popeyes, which struggled as customers stayed home more and regional restrictions forced dining rooms to close. The Oracle of Omaha also dumped all of his Occidental stock during the COVID-19 pandemic—despite his sweet dividend arrangement with the energy company, under which Oxy paid a hefty 8% yield exclusively to Berkshire Hathaway after Buffett's company backed Oxy's acquisition of Anadarko last year. As oil prices hit record lows this spring with airplanes grounded and travel at a standstill, energy companies like Occidental have floundered; desperate for cash, Oxy had cut its dividend to its non-Buffett shareholders twice this year, to just a penny per share. Besides dumping Goldman outright, Buffett sold shares in other banks, cutting his position in JPMorgan Chase by 61%, and trimming his holdings in Wells Fargo and PNC. This year, Goldman has been a bright star in the financial industry, outperforming its Wall Street peers thanks to robust trading profits; and though all bank stocks are in negative territory for 2020, they haven't lost nearly as much as airlines and energy companies. Buffett may be shying away from banks in anticipation of increasing loan defaults as the economic pain resulting from the pandemic sinks in, which Wall Street CEOs have lately warned of.

18,Stocks barely budge on Wall Street; S&P 500 just shy of high,Stocks barely budge on Wall Street; S&P 500 just shy of high,"NEW YORK (AP) — Stock indexes barely budged on Wall Street Friday, leaving the S&P 500 just shy of its record once again. The S&P 500 edged down 0.58, or less than 0.1%, to 3,372.85 after drifting between small gains and losses throughout the day. They’re the latest meandering moves for the market, which has taken a pause after erasing almost all of the steep losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In each of the prior two days, the S&P 500 made a brief run above its record closing high, which was set in February, only to fade in the afternoon. It remains within 0.4% of its record. Wall Street was nearly evenly split between stocks that rose and fell, and the moves were almost uniformly modest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 34.30 points, or 0.1%, to 27,931.02, while the Nasdaq composite dipped 23.20, or 0.2%, to 11,019.30. Consumer spending is the main locomotive for the U.S. economy, and a report on Friday showed some more improvements for U.S. retailers, though less than economists expected. Sales at grocery stores, gas stations and other retailers rose 1.2% last month from June. It’s the third straight month of gains, following a historic plunge in the spring, but it marked a sharp slowdown from June’s 8.4% growth. It also fell short of the 2% growth that economists were expecting. The report showed that the economy is now “more in a gentle phase of recovery,” said Mike Zigmont, director of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. “It’s positive, but it’s not as ballistic as it was before,” he said. Economists say consumer spending could be under more pressure following the expiration of U.S. government programs to aid the economy, including $600 in extra unemployment benefits each week. Investors say it’s crucial that Washington deliver another lifeline to the economy, and markets seem to be assuming a deal will happen. But Democrats and Republicans say they remain far apart on a possible compromise. “Congress has to follow up on the stimulus package because they essentially promised it,” Zigmont said. “Main Street America is counting on it,” he said. “You can’t pull the rug out from under the world.” The day’s trading was notably quiet, with only a few stocks in the S&P 500 falling even 2%. Among the biggest gainers in the index was Applied Materials, which rose 3.9%. The tech company","Aug 14, 2020",https://apnews.com/c0bf0eab6ed9f26fa335a12d32dbbf14
