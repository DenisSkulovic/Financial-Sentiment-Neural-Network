0,Airline Stocks Fall as Hopes for Rebound in Leisure Travel Fade | Barron's,Airlines Stocks Are Falling Because None of Us Are Going Anywhere. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily. Here’s BofA’s List of,"  Airline stocks were down sharply on Thursday as a new reality appeared to be sinking in: The rebound in leisure travel may be sputtering, and there are signs that corporate travel may not materialize to pick up the slack. Air traffic has rebounded a bit since the pandemic started, largely because leisure travelers have started boarding planes to take vacations or see family and friends. But a leisure-travel recovery extending beyond the summer is looking dicier. More than a dozen U.S. states and cities recently imposed quarantines amid a surge in coronavirus cases. New jobless claims are still rising. And federal unemployment benefits are set to expire for 31 million Americans at the end of July, potentially pinching consumer spending. The news appears to be battering airline stocks, down an average of 4%, according to the NYSE Arca Airline Index. The industry is counting on corporate travel to boost revenue in the fall and winter. Yet signs of a comeback in business travel are looking increasingly remote, according to Citigroup’s Mark Manduca. “We see an uncomfortable reality brewing within the rhetoric of many global companies, particularly in our own financial services sector: We are going to all be at home a lot longer than we currently anticipate ...and many of us will never return to office-based work at all,” he wrote in a note published Thursday. Expectations for a corporate rebound in the next year are likely to “all but evaporate,” he adds, as work-from-home trends become ingrained. Hopping on a plane for business won’t make sense if clients are working from home, and companies face litigation risk in sending employees on the road amid the pandemic. The trends are rippling through sectors like financials and tech. Barclays (BCS) CEO Jes Staley recently commented that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in the building may be a thing of the past,” according to Manduca. Goldman Sachs Group CEO David Solomon said “rest assured, returning is entirely voluntary.” And Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said that “we’ve proven we can operate with no footprint,” adding that he can envision employees working from home at least part time. Big Tech firms are making similar comments, Manduca notes. Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said on CNN that up to half the company’s employees “could be working remotely within the next five to 10 years.” The trends may make it much","Jul 9, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-stocks-fall-as-hopes-for-rebound-in-leisure-travel-fade-51594320459

2,Here's Why Airline Stocks Are Up Today | The Motley Fool,Here's Why Airline Stocks Are Up Today. Airlines are gaining altitude along with the broader markets.. What happened. So what.,"   It's a ""risk-on"" day on Wall Street Friday, as after a few days of selling, investors are taking a glass-half-full view of where things stand with the COVID-19 pandemic. That's helping to give a lift to airline shares, one of the sectors most impacted by the pandemic. Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) is leading the sector higher on Friday, up 9% as of noon EDT, while shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) are all up more than 5% apiece and shares of other carriers including Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are not far behind. Airline stocks have been volatile since the pandemic began. The stocks bottomed out in March on concerns that a severe drop off in travel demand would lead to a round of bankruptcies in the sector, but have recovered somewhat in the months since as travel has slowly returned. In recent weeks the airlines have traded mostly on broader market sentiment about progress in fighting the pandemic, and indications about what the economy will look like once the outbreak is behind us. Friday brought good news in the fight against the COVID-19 virus, with Gilead Sciences presenting data indicating its remdesivir treatment reduced the risk of death. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. There was company-specific news for airline investors to consider on Friday as well. United reached a deal with its pilots union to offer early retirements and voluntary furloughs, potentially reducing the need for the airline to do massive involuntary layoffs later this Fall. American, meanwhile, is said to be reconsidering at least part of its Boeing 737 Max order as it rethinks its capacity requirements in the years to come. Spirit might have gotten a lift from commentary from Cowen analyst Helane Becker that low-cost carriers are better suited to profit in this environment. With corporate and international travel expected to be low through 2020, at least the airlines are focused on stimulating domestic leisure demand via fare sales. Airline stocks are in an odd position right now. With the industry raising nearly $50 billion in liquidity to go along with a similar amount of government support, there is no carrier that is a near-term risk of bankruptcy. However, with a full recovery likely to take years, there isn't a lot of reason for investors to get excited about buying in. For now, expect","Jul 10, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/10/heres-why-airline-stocks-are-up-today.aspx
3,Should You Buy or Sell Airline Stocks Right Now? | The Motley Fool,Should You Buy or Sell Airline Stocks Right Now?. Use this roadmap to invest in the airline sector right now..,"   Although the stock market is near an all-time high, there are still many sectors that remain below their pre-pandemic levels. One of those sectors is the airlines, which for months have been a fierce battleground between those who think the worst of the pandemic is behind us, and others who expect a prolonged slowdown in air traffic. For everyone in between, airline stocks present a high risk/high reward opportunity in need of a roadmap. This article is meant to help you determine if buying or selling airlines is right for you, as well as what to look for when shopping for top airline stocks.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Since reaching their lows in early May, airlines have enjoyed a nice recovery, but are still down substantially for the year.  LUV DATA BY YCHARTS As you can see, airlines are not all performing the same. There's a big difference between the performance of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and a lot of that has to do with varying degrees of financial strength. The first main aspect to consider when you're thinking about buying or selling an airline stock in this market is the strength of its balance sheet. In a time when air traffic and revenues are substantially lower than normal, it matters how strong a company is financially, more so than even how efficient the company's operations are. Therefore, a company with a lot of cash and ample credit is preferred over even the most efficient airlines. This isn't to say that operational strength doesn't matter -- it does -- but it matters less in a crisis, especially one of this magnitude.  LUV DEBT TO CAPITAL (QUARTERLY) DATA BY YCHARTS From a balance sheet perspective, Southwest Airlines is the best. This shouldn't come as a surprise to those who have been following the industry for a while. Yet even Southwest is concerned, citing cost and spending cuts, an earnings collapse, and the need for government support even with its ""fortress balance sheet."" Another point to consider is the daily cash burn rate, which is the amount of cash an airline is losing every day. Many of the prior estimates from late April have been revised to reflect improvements to air traffic as states reopened their economies.

United shares traded more than 2% lower in the premarket. Foot Locker (FL) — An analyst at Susquehanna upgraded Foot Locker to positive from neutral and hiked his price target on the stock to $34 per share from $25 per share. The new price target implies an upside of 21.5% over the next 12 months.

Redfin (RDFN) — RBC Capital Markets downgraded Redfin to sector perform from outperform, citing a high valuation after the stock skyrocketed 400% from its mid-March low. “Valuation has crept up to an extent we see the risk-reward reasonably balanced, given larger macro uncertainties,” RBC said. Wells Fargo (WFC) — The banking giant was upgraded to outperform from hold by an analyst at Baird, who said the stock’s decline this year is an opportunity “to add bank exposure.” The analyst also said Wells Fargo has a “highly attractive” valuation when looking at a number of metrics. Beyond Meat (BYND) — Citigroup initiated Beyond Meat with a sell rating and a price target of $123 per share, which implies a downside of 12% from Thursday’s close of $141.22 per share. Citi expects the meatless meat maker to face long-term pressure as competition in the space grows as well as near-term struggles “as a result of its exposure to the foodservice segment.” Shares of Beyond Meat dropped 2.6%.

How you can buy option that’s not costly, yet has a good chance of profitability
Helps in buying option that is not costly, yet has good chance of profitability Helps in buying option that is not costly, yet has good chance of profitability    A circuit limit of 5 per cent on Jet stocks was imposed last year by the stock exchanges. Under normal circumstances, the circuit limit gets triggered when the share price swings 10 per cent up or down. But in the case of Jet airways, the exchanges were forced to reduce the limit to 5 per cent after the company went into the insolvency process and could not submit information as required under disclosure norms. Last year, SBI dragged the company to the insolvency court over unpaid dues to the tune of ₹8,500 crore. Jet Airways has been trading under ‘Z’ group category which includes companies which have failed to comply with listing requirements and/or have failed to resolve investor complaints. The security of the company was shifted from rolling segment to trade-for-trade segment, wherein the settlement in the security will take place on a gross basis with 100 per cent upfront margin and 5 per cent price band. The CoC has received interest from three entities to acquire the airline. But none of them has so far placed a financial bid. One of the potential buyers sought more time to do the due diligence so the CoC has extended the last date for placing a financial bid.

10,7 Top Robinhood Stocks: Do the Pros Agree? | Kiplinger,Save up to 67%. 7 Top Robinhood Stocks: Do the Pros Agree?. The success of some Robinhood traders has piqued,"Getty Images One of the many stock market phenomena of 2020 has been the rise of the Robinhood trader. The trading app, which has become extremely popular among millennials, boasts 13 million accounts, putting it on par with the likes of Schwab. And given a few stories of its traders making millions virtually overnight, some investors naturally have an interest in following the most popular Robinhood stocks. It hasn't been all gravy, of course. For every eye-popping Robinhood success, there are many more normalized returns you don't hear about, not to mention deep losses. And Robinhood, for all of its good in helping bring down trading costs across the board, hasn't been without its share of negative publicity. The app suffered several outages during the bear market, leaving traders unable to act in the midst of massive moves. And the recent suicide of a young trader from Illinois highlighted the dangers of providing access to sophisticated investment methods with little vetting, as well as seemingly ""gamifying"" investing. Robinhood investors have nonetheless piqued the curiosity of the broader community. And it's easy to satisfy one's curiosity about their investing habits: Robinhood itself lists the app's most popular stocks at any given time, including how many accounts are invested in each. Here are seven of the top Robinhood stocks and see whether Wall Street's pros see what these traders see. We ran seven of the app's top 10 names through TipRanks' database to monitor what the analyst community had to say about each. 1 of 7 Getty Images To say that cannabis company Aurora Cannabis (ACB, $11.17) has had a rough go is an understatement.

For more than two years, Apple stock has been the largest holding in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, roughly doubling in value over that time. The coronavirus pandemic has tipped the scales further: Apple now accounts for nearly 44% of Buffett's roughly $214.5 billion in stocks, based on the investor's most recent disclosures—including his announcement that he sold out of airline stocks in April.

Of course, while the heavy concentration in Apple has, as some observers have pointed out, left the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio lopsided and less than diversified, that's as much a reflection of how well Apple stock has performed this year—up some 30% year to date—as it is of how poorly Buffett's other holdings have done. Indeed, Buffett's second-largest holding, Bank of America stock, has plunged 34% so far this year; his next largest, Coca-Cola, has fallen 19%; after that, American Express is down 25%. Even doubling down on Apple wasn't enough for Buffett to make up for those dismal returns: In a year in which the S&P 500 is down less than 2% so far, the stocks Buffett owns have fallen an average of nearly 12%. The only stock that did better than Apple in Berkshire's holdings is Amazon, up almost 67%—but Buffett's stake in the company, worth $1.6 billion, makes it a tiny holding next to Apple, of which the investor owns $93.5 billion in shares. Holding those cards, Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has underperformed many of the companies in its own portfolio, as well as the broader market. Berkshire shares have fallen 20% year to date. Though Buffett is known for his investing prowess, it's likely many average investors' returns have easily outperformed his—even if they don't have nearly half of their money invested in Apple. Apple has become such a juggernaut, with a $1.66 trillion market cap that makes it the most valuable company in the world, that it dominates every major U.S. stock index and many broad-based mutual funds. Apple accounts for nearly 6% of the value of the S&P 500—a weighting that has helped buoy investors' returns amid spiking market volatility.

Three key factors could push airlines down: weak financials, a second wave of the pandemic, and high daily operational costs. By: Joseph Young | Email | Leave a comment Airlines cannot catch a break. United Airlines might furlough 36,000 employees, AirAsia shares were suspended, and American Airlines could have 20,000 employees in excess. Airline stocks are barely showing signs of recovery after a steep fall since early June. Three key factors could push airline companies down despite a booming stock market. The main factors are weak financials, a second wave of the pandemic, and high daily operational costs. Airlines have big overhead costs because of long-term aircraft leases. In April, United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) reported $70 million and $50 million in daily losses, respectively. Major U.S. airline giants secured multi-billion dollar loans, liquidity, and capital in the first quarter of 2020. Delta, for instance, secured $5.4 billion in capital in April to sustain its expenses. If Delta burns through $50 million a day, $5.4 billion covers just 108 days of operating costs. Delta secured another $10 billion in liquidity, but many other companies do not have that luxury.   AirAsia, as an example, had their shares suspended after Ernst & Young notified Malaysia’s stock exchange about the firm’s financials. Emphasizing that it has doubts on whether AirAsia can continue to operate, EY said: The travel and border restrictions implemented by countries around the world have led to a significant fall in demand for air travel which","Jul 9, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/3-reasons-airline-stocks-arent-flying-during-record-market-gains/
14,Is the Options Market Predicting a Spike in American Airlines (AAL) Stock?,. . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD.,"                                                   Investors in American Airlines Group Inc. AAL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Aug 21 $8.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for American Airlines shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, American Airlines is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Transportation - Airline industry that ranks in the Bottom 14% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimate. The net effect has narrowed our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of $7.44 per share to a loss of $7.03 in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about American Airlines right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   The airline industry has been hit hard by COVID-19. Border closures and shelter in place measures brought the industry to a standstill during the virus’ initial wave, as air traffic was grounded across the globe. Whether the pandemic has peaked or not, United Airlines (UAL) upcoming flight schedule acknowledges normality is still a way off. Air travel volume remains weak and currently United’s cash burn rate amounts to roughly $40 million a week. As a result, United has issued warnings that almost half of its workforce might be furloughed in the fall. Further keeping air travel rates down are recent measures by New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut which require any travelers from states with COVID-19 test rates above 10% to self-quarantine for two weeks. The measures have resulted in a slew of discount offers from United. However, recent United data shows the promise of low prices is not enough to entice the public while the risk of quarantine still looms. As a result, United’s August schedule is expected to drop by 65% compared to last year’s capacity. This is lower than the expected 60% drop United were anticipating only a week ago. Still, the latest figures are an improvement on June and July’s numbers, which were down year-over-year by 88% and 75%, respectively. United have said the rest of 2020’s schedule will probably resemble that of August’s. What this means to Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg, is that more uncertainty lies ahead. The 5-star analyst said, “The bottom line is that, although we believe the industry is exhibiting signs of a nascent recovery, investors should be prepared for an unpredictable (and at times erratic) rate of improvement until either the federal government coordinates interstate quarantines and/or an effective therapeutic/vaccine becomes widely available.” Nevertheless, Linenberg keeps a Buy rating on UAL, along with a $54 price target. The implication for investors? Potential upside of a hefty 65%. (To watch Linenberg’s track record, click here)   Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is having itself a year.

The smart-beta 2.0 ETF ended the session on July 8 with $100.5 million in assets under management (AUM). What’s more, GOAU’s share price closed at a new record high for the fourth consecutive trading session on July 8, ending at $22.35. “This milestone is an important one,” says Frank Holmes, the Company’s CEO and chief investment officer. “Many broker-dealers require ETFs to meet a minimum threshold in AUM and daily trading volume before they can be made available to investors. Exceeding $100 million in AUM may help GOAU quality for greater distribution and attract additional assets.”   The achievement comes just a month after the Company’s airlines ETF, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), crossed above $1 billion in AUM as value investors piled into securities impacted by coronavirus-related travel restrictions. Between March 3 and June 10, JETS saw a remarkable 70 straight trading days of positive daily inflows. That’s thanks in large part to tactical investors anticipating a rebound and millennial investors using Robinhood, many of whom began to make bets on the airline industry in early March and April before Warren Buffett’s May 2 announcement that he had dumped all of his airline stocks. In the quarter ended June 30, JETS’ AUM grew 297 percent, from $302.0 million to $1.20 billion.  “GOAU is doing precisely what we designed it to do, and we’re very pleased to see its AUM exceed $100 million,” Mr. Holmes says. “We spent about 8,000 hours developing the ETF, using our decades of gold stock investing expertise as active gold fund managers. We analyzed different methodologies and portfolio structures and looked at dozens of factors one-by-one. It’s truly been a labor of love, and I’m thrilled to see that investors are acknowledging that hard work.  “Both GOAU and JETS are dynamic, smart-beta 2.0 ETFs,” Mr. Holmes continues. “GOAU has a unique portfolio structure, 30 percent of which is based on using mean reversion to rebalance the three largest gold royalty names—Franco-Nevada, Wheaton Precious Metals and","Jul 10, 2020",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/10/2060763/0/en/The-U-S-Global-GO-GOLD-and-Precious-Metal-Miners-ETF-GOAU-Crosses-Above-100-Million-Milestone.html

United Airlines bonds downgraded deeper into,"S&P Global Ratings late Thursday downgraded United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, -2.48% debt one notch to B+, from BB-, saying it expects the airline to generate ""substantial cash flow deficit,"" thanks to a ""steep decline"" in bookings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A return to positive cash flow is expected next year, S&P said. United is taking several steps to offset the fewer bookings, but these will not be enough, it said. ""As of now, we expect air traffic to begin to recover in the second half of 2020, but any delay will prolong weakness in credit metrics,"" the ratings agency said.

18,"When It Comes to an Airline Recovery, LUV Stock Is the Best Pick | InvestorPlace","When It Comes to an Air Travel Recovery, Southwest Airlines Stock Is the Best Pick. The company had historically strong"," After peaking at over $40, fears of the rapidly spreading coronavirus across the United States sent Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) sharply lower. Increasing selling pressure may send LUV stock back to its 52-week low of $22.47.  But that isn’t necessarily too much for the carrier to overcome. After all, Southwest has a favorable debt/equity profile compared to its peers. That is because it always has run with comparatively thin margins, Southwest has a good chance of surviving the current turmoil. So, at what stock price should investors consider when buying shares? Southwest’s expected growth exceeds that of the industry. Though its expected sales growth is under 2% above the industry average, the company earns a growth score of 78/100, above that of the S&P 500’s 75/100 score. In the next year, sales will fall. The -2.9% may prove too optimistic if travel restrictions imposed by the European Union on the U.S. are not lifted soon. Still, in the next three years, sales may grow by almost 2%. This is a realistic expectation that Southwest’s management may plan for. Data courtesy of Stock Rover Southwest has a higher gross margin than its peers. And if it aggressively cuts costs further to improve cash flow, it will have no problem sustaining a decent net margin. Plus, with a better debt/equity profile than the bigger airlines, Southwest may survive long periods of low passenger traffic. Data courtesy of Stock Rover As shown above, Southwest runs at the highest operating and gross margin combination. This also suggests that if flight demand remains weak for the rest of the year, less efficient airlines will file for bankruptcy first. This will cut flight supply and give Southwest Airlines an edge. LUV stock also benefits from the tact that the company is also more nimble than the bigger airline companies. With higher profit margin potential, the company does not need to cut as much operating costs. This would help it sustain its service levels and customer satisfaction. In its June 11 report, Southwest estimated an average daily core cash burn will be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. Previously, the company forecast a cash burn of around $25 million in Q2. Southwest also raised $16.7 billion. It did so by getting $12.2 billion from financing and sale-leaseback transactions. It also sold $2.2 billion worth of common shares. The Payroll Support Program (PSP) added","Jul 9, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/07/potential-recovery-luv-stock-best-pick/
19,On the road again | Active Trader Commentary,"On the road again. . . . . What to read next.... Stock pauses, options don’t. Options overdrive. Jobs data","  There’s more than one way to get out of your house. Everyone knows the travel industry has been one of the hardest-hit areas of the economy in recent months—and it’s been left for dead by many investors, as airline, cruise, and hotel stocks have struggled to keep pace with the rest of market during the March–July rebound. One chart pretty much sums up the situation. American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and United Airlines (UAL)—all of which sold off much more than the broad market in February–March—have rallied less than half as much as the S&P 500 (SPX) since March 23, despite a massive jump off their mid-May lows: Source: Power E*TRADE That’s just one part of the “travel” story, though. Some analysts have pointed out that Americans desperate for even the smallest change of scenery may be hitting the road in larger-than-expected numbers, which could be good news for auto parts and supply stocks.1 Some of the high-profile names in this business have already mounted some serious rallies off their March lows. In stark contrast to the picture presented by airline stocks, the following chart shows Advance Auto Parts (AAP), O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), and AutoZone (AZO) have all lapped the S&P 500 (SPX) over the past 14 weeks: Source: Power E*TRADE While these stocks may not be the sexiest tickers on a trader’s screen, they’ve all topped the SPX by at least 13 percentage points since late March, even though they’ve been pulling back or trading sideways since mid-June (they’ve all outperformed the Nasdaq 100 since March, too). In fact, many bullish traders may be looking for some of these stocks to give back even more of their rallies before attempting to catch another potential upswing. Another angle to this story is the increased popularity of used cars, which was gaining attention last year and appeared to be kicking into an even higher gear early in 2020.2 (Reports of sky-high demand recently led some industry watchers to advise potential buyers to wait for the market to cool down.3) In addition to potentially supporting the longer-term bull case for auto-supply stocks (more used cars means more things that need to be fixed), it also has implications for another potentially overlooked group of stocks: When you get a chance, check out the charts of used-car specialists Sonic Automotive (SAH) and CarMax (KMX)—both have staged huge rallies off their","Jul 9, 2020",https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/library/perspectives/daily-insights/on-the-road-again
