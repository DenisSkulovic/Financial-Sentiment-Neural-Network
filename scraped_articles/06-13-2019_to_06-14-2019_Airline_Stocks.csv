0,Why Shares of American Airlines Are Gaining Altitude on Thursday | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of American Airlines Are Gaining Altitude on Thursday. The airline was able to successfully push through an increase,"   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) are up more than 5% on Thursday following a report that the airline had successfully led a round of domestic fare increases in recent days, strengthening the case for investing in the sector despite lingering questions about demand. While airlines are forbidden from colluding on pricing, they do monitor each other's fare structure closely and try to match rates. For this reason, an attempt by one airline to raise fares often either succeeds or fails based on whether competitors choose to match the price. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP. J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker in a note said American Airlines had increased domestic fares by $5 one-way on Wednesday morning, and that increase seemingly was matched by a systemwide hike by Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ:HA) and a ""substantive"" boost by Southwest (NYSE:LUV). This would mark the second fare hike since the beginning of May, and Baker admitted he was surprised to see it stick so soon after the previous one. Shares of American have been grounded in 2019, down more than 5% year to date prior to Thursday's move, on concerns about the health of the domestic economy and fears that trade wars could eat into international business travel demand. But Baker wrote that domestic fare resilience is not priced into the stocks, saying that stronger fares and potential stronger-than-expected performance in the ongoing second quarter could reverse investors' ""recent apathy"" toward airline stocks. Shares of American Airlines even after the Thursday's bump are down 24% over the past year, underperforming rivals including United Continental Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and Southwest. But the shares are hardly cheap, trading at a multiple to earnings slightly above that of United and Delta.  AIRLINE DATA BY YCHARTS American is in the process of a makeover, including new routes from its Dallas-Fort Worth megahub and a cost-cutting program expected to generate $1 billion in savings. It's also less exposed to international markets than United or Delta, and has already cut back its service to China. Airlines tend to trade up and down based on the health of the economy, so there is ample macro-reason to be cautious about American Airlines' shares today. But if the fare increase does hold, so too can the stock's push-off from its lows.    Before you consider American Airlines Group Inc., you'll want to hear this.","Jun 13, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/13/why-shares-of-american-airlines-are-gaining-altitu.aspx
1,"JETS Airline ETF rising on strong fares, lower oil prices",. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Airline ETF Takes Off,"Investors are jumping on board airlines, one of the few industries with pricing power in a low-inflation environment. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) is up 10 percent since the beginning of June and is on pace for its best monthly gain in its four years of existence. It’s also leading virtually every other ETF in June — aside from SPDR Materials (XLB), featured last week. JETS started to move on apparent value hunting. It then continued to run after J.P. Morgan noticed carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) had raised fares. They were especially successful with the key business-traveler niche. That followed a Goldman Sachs upgrade of United Continental (UAL) last week. The analyst argued that investors were too worried about the company’s shrinking Chinese exposure. UAL is the world’s biggest airline operator. Falling energy prices is another positive because jet fuel remains the industry’s largest input cost. But let’s go back to pricing, which may be the most noteworthy part of the story. Most readers of Market Insights probably know inflation’s rising so slowly that the Federal Reserve is preparing to cut interest rates. That’s why XLB spiked last week. The latest consumer price index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed clothing, energy and used vehicles got cheaper. However the same report specifically mentioned airline fares as one category on the rise. Consider those two trends: rising prices for their services and falling input costs for fuel. Suddenly airlines seem to have a double-positive in terms of profit margins. The industry’s price action in the stock market has been so strong recently that the 10 largest holdings in JETS have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last week. Here’s a list: While JETS is heavily focused on carriers, it also has a small allocation to aerospace firms like General Dynamics (GD). A mix of international firms like Air Canada and Gol Linhas Aereas (GOL) are in in the portfolio as well. Traders looking for exposure to airlines may want to consider the liquidity of different securities. One potential drawback of JETS is that it’s thinly traded, averaging less than 50,000 shares per day in the last month. Individual holdings in the fund, on the other hand, are very active. DAL and AAL both average more than 5 million shares per session, while UAL typically has more than 3 million in turnover.

4,The Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio: All 48 Buffett Stocks | Nasdaq,The Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio: All 48 Buffett Stocks. SEE ALSO: 50 Top Stocks That Billionaires Love. SEE ALSO: 57 Dividend," When folks think of the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) portfolio and its collection of holdings, most of which were selected by Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, the companies that most readily come to mind are probably American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and, more recently, Apple (AAPL). But a deep dive into Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings reveals a more complicated picture. Berkshire Hathaway held positions in 48 separate stocks as of March 31, according to regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the portfolio of ""Buffett stocks"" isn't as diversified as the number might suggest. In some cases, BRK.B holds more than one share class in the same company. Some holdings are so small as to be immaterial leftovers from earlier bets the Oracle of Omaha has yet to completely exit. And perhaps most importantly, Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio is actually pretty concentrated. The top six holdings account for almost 70% of the portfolio's total value. The top 10 positions comprise nearly 80%. Banks and airlines, to cite a couple of sectors, carry quite a load in this portfolio. Then there's the fact that several Buffett stocks actually were picked by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Here, we examine each and every holding to give investors a better understanding of the entire Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.  Shares held: 59,400 Holding value: $6,637,000 Percent of portfolio: 0.003% United Parcel Service (UPS, $100.01) might be the world's biggest package delivery company, but it's immaterial when it comes to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. With fewer than 60,000 shares, this is the most meager of Buffett stocks - a rump position, leftovers, an odd lot. Buffett first invested in UPS in the first quarter of 2006, when he picked up 1.43 million shares worth about $113.5 million. That comes to an average price per share of $79.38. UPS never was a major part of Berkshire's portfolio, and Buffett has pared the position over the years to where it wouldn't be a surprise if he exited the stake at any time. (Berkshire recently dropped another small holding - telecom giant Verizon (VZ) - in the first quarter of 2019 when he dumped his last 928 shares.) Although Buffett can be fairly chatty about some of his more notable stock picks, he typically doesn't comment on BRK.B's buys and sells. There's no mention of United Parcel Service in CNBC's indispensable Warren Buffett archive.

6,Jet Airways Shares Restricted By Indian Stock Exchanges - Simple Flying,Jet Airways Shares Restricted By Indian Stock Exchanges. What happened?. Why are the shares being frozen?. What does this mean," Indian Stock Exchanges have decided to freeze the buying and selling of Jet Airways shares from June 28th, as the airline struggles to find a way to bring itself back to life. As reported by Mint.com, Indian stock markets decided to take action on the trading of Jet Airways shares yesterday, in a move dubbed “art of preventive surveillance measures to curb excessive volatility”. What this means is that the shares were fluctuating so wildly (with some reports indicating that the shares dropped over 23%) that the stock market officials are stepping in to prevent the entire company from becoming worthless. Additionally, they are worried that with so many rumors abound in the market, Jet Airways will become an incredibly speculative stock and will drive the market in an unpredictable direction. Apparently, the stock exchanges have been hearing rumors non-stop about the airline and have not had a clear answer on the future of the company. “According to the circular, exchanges have been seeking clarification from the company in the recent past with respect to various rumours floating in the market. However, the company has failed to provide prompt responses and the responses received are not clear and satisfactory.”  – Indian Economic Times. The exchanges have not even seen the most recent yearly financials of the company, which are normally posted just after March 2019. “There are concerns with regard to continuity of flow of information about the company which is very vital for the appropriate price discovery in the scrip. Hence, trading in the scrip may not reflect the actual status of the company,” – NSE Statement to the Indian Economic Times. In general financial rules, a company’s value must be made clear to the market in order for its shares to be traded. If a company makes a loss, it must be announced publicly, otherwise it is a breach of trust of the marketplace. The joint stock exchanges of India are allowing Jet Airways time to make their financial position clear (either they have money to continue operating or they are insolvent) or they will freeze trading shares by the 28th of June. Naturally, you might be wondering why Jet Airways doesn’t release its financial figures. Using logic, we can only assume that their financial standing is so dire that if they did make an announcement their stock price would fall to zero.

By CCN.com: Tesla has given investors a torrid time on the stock market so far this year. Shares of the Elon Musk-led company have crashed close to 37% so far in 2019 even though the billionaire CEO has been trying hard to pump the stock through his wild claims. Somehow, Tesla stock started picking up some momentum heading into the company’s annual shareholder meeting. Elon Musk made another valiant attempt to boost the stock pricing with a blockbuster prediction. Tesla stock should have taken off after Elon Musk’s statement at the shareholder meeting. He said: “We have a decent shot at a record quarter at every level…and 90% of orders coming from…new customers.” The Tesla CEO also added that the electric vehicle maker isn’t facing a “demand problem,” claiming that sales of the company’s cars have “exceeded production.” If that’s indeed the case, Tesla could deliver a massive quarter when it releases its second-quarter results. But the market doesn’t seem to be buying Musk’s promises. Tesla stock dipped over 3.6% on June 13 in the aftermath of the shareholders’ meeting, indicating that investors are not confident the company will be able to meet the CEO’s claims. Tesla reportedly sold 13,950 Model 3s in May, according to InsideEVs. This was a significant jump over the 10,050 units it moved in the prior month.

Messamore | Email | Leave a comment By CCN.com: Friday’s Chewy IPO was a feeding frenzy of investor enthusiasm for this summer’s latest hot new stock. The IPO is clearly not dead in 2019, despite the brutal debuts of Lyft and Uber, which were all bark and no bite. The tremendous showing of IPOs like CrowdStrike, Fiverr, Beyond Meat, and Chewy show that Wall Street is still hungry for promising new companies with husky business prospects. The online pet retailer’s total raise topped $1 billion. Chewy shares (NYSE: CHWY) debuted on the stock market Friday at $22 per share, and rocketed up the chart to retrieve $41 a share by midday. By late afternoon the PetSmart subsidiary’s stock had settled down to $35.98 a share, netting a mouth-watering 63% rally over the IPO share price in just a few hours. Chewy reported a net loss of $268 million in 2018, narrowing its loss from the previous year’s $338 million. But investors don’t see this stock rolling over any time soon. Strong customer loyalty, a 60% growth rate, and $3.5 billion in sales have investors panting.   Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box Thursday, Rett Wallace of Triton Research said: “On the one hand, it’s not profitable. On the other hand, the sock puppet.

12,"Jet Airways sale: Lenders, stakeholders to meet to iron out thorny issues - The Financial Express","Jet Airways sale: Lenders, stakeholders to meet to iron out thorny issues. The meeting also holds significance as there were","By Anwesha Ganguly In an effort to iron out the thorny issues involving the sale of Jet Airways, its lenders and representatives of Etihad Airways and Hindujas met on Wednesday. Sources said the meeting took stock of the situation wherein Etihad and Hindujas wanted some clarity on the required funding to revive the grounded carrier. The meeting assumes significance as a Dutch court has already initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the airline, while here two operational creditors have filed insolvency petitions with the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai, and one of the pilots’ union is also planning to move the tribunal to recover their salaries and other dues. “Etihad is an existing stakeholder in Jet Airways, so lenders and Etihad Airways are engaging to evaluate all possible options to reach a conclusion on Jet Airways — it does not mean they have come to a decision. The Hindujas have not yet formally committed their position either,” an official involved in the proceedings said. The meeting also holds significance as there were speculations that the Hinduja Group, which last month said it was evaluating the Jet Airways’ opportunity, had finally exited the negotiations. A spokesperson from the Hinduja group was not available for comment, but Etihad Airways termed these reports speculative. In April, the State Bank of India-led consortium of lenders had invited bids for 75% stake in Jet Airways after the airline failed to meet debt obligations. Etihad Airways, Jet’s strategic partner, was the only serious party to show interest at the time. The Abu Dhabi-based airline was willing to hold minority stake in the airline, subject to multiple conditions, including that lenders taking a significant haircut on the airline’s debt. Several reports have said investors also want to be exempted from any ongoing investigations regarding the affairs of Jet Airways. A Dutch court last month declared Jet as bankrupt following a plea submitted by two European operational creditors, H Essar Finance and Wallenborn Transport. No appeal has been filed on behalf of the airline as lenders are examining the implications of a foreign bankruptcy ruling on Jet Airways. At least one of Jet’s aircraft stationed at the Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam has been seized by foreign creditors. In India, two operational creditors, Shaman Wheels and Gaggar Enterprises, have filed an insolvency plea against Jet Airways with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai.
