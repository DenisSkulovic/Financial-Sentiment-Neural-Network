0,Why Shares of Spirit Airlines Dropped 11% in July | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Spirit Airlines Dropped 11% in July. Higher-than-expected third-quarter costs took the lift out of Spirit shares.. What,"   Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) fell 11.1% in July, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, as investors ran for the exits after the discount airline provided third-quarter guidance that was well below expectations. There's a case to be made that the factors leading to the forecast cut were temporary, but investors would apparently rather watch this story play out from the terminal. Shares of Spirit Airlines, a no-frills discounter that offers low fares and charges for perks that other airlines offer for free, were on autopilot through the first half of July, trading up almost 16% for the month prior to the airline's July 24 earnings announcement. Spirit grew revenue by 18.9% year over year in the quarter and beat the consensus analyst earnings estimate by $0.04 per share, but the stock plunged due to management's commentary on the third quarter. A SPIRIT AIRLINES A319. IMAGE SOURCE: SPIRIT AIRLINES. Spirit warned that it expects nonfuel costs to be up 7% to 8% in the third quarter, well above expectations, due to costs associated with a runway closure at Fort Lauderdale, a key Spirit destination, as well as 200 basis points' worth of costs due to higher estimates for flight disruptions and 150 basis points related to reduced capacity due to cancellations. The runway issues were known, but the disruptions and completions issues were new and attributed by the company to weather. Spirit coming into 2019 had eliminated some of the slack in its schedule designed to cushion against weather disruptions and cancellations, but the airline has faced more weather challenges than it expected. Spirit is in the process of adjusting crew schedules and reserves, and the Fort Lauderdale construction project that has caused closures is expected to be done this year, but in the near term the damage has been done. There's both an optimistic and pessimistic spin to Spirit's cost issues. The optimist would note that all the factors driving up costs appear to be temporary, and there's a strong case to be made that the third quarter will be the worst of it followed by a recovery. The pessimist would note that the mistakes made were fundamental to airline operations, and question whether Spirit is growing too fast to be managed and perhaps at risk for further stumbles. Spirit has some potential tailwinds that should push it forward in the quarters to","Aug 8, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/08/why-shares-of-spirit-airlines-dropped-11-in-july.aspx
1,Don't Sell Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) Before You Read This - Simply Wall St News,Don't Sell Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) Before You Read This. How Do You Calculate Singapore Airlines's P/E Ratio?. Is A,"This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Singapore Airlines Limited's (SGX:C6L), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Singapore Airlines has a P/E ratio of 16.37, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 6.1%. View our latest analysis for Singapore Airlines The formula for price to earnings is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for Singapore Airlines: P/E of 16.37 = SGD9.05 ÷ SGD0.55 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.) A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each SGD1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.' We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (10.7) for companies in the airlines industry is lower than Singapore Airlines's P/E. Singapore Airlines's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. If earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings. Singapore Airlines saw earnings per share decrease by 41% last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 19%. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 13% per year over the last three years. This growth rate might warrant a low P/E ratio. One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth. While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.

2,Have Insiders Sold American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Shares Recently? - Simply Wall St News,Have Insiders Sold American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Shares Recently?. American Airlines Group Insider Transactions Over The Last Year. Does,"Anyone interested in American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) should probably be aware that the Independent Director, Ray Robinson, recently divested US$202k worth of shares in the company, at an average price of US$29.11 each. That sale was 21.8% of their holding, so it does make us raise an eyebrow. View our latest analysis for American Airlines Group Chairman & CEO William Parker made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.4m worth of shares at a price of US$28.09 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$28.63. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices. Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 154k shares worth US$4.6m. On the other hand they divested 6930 shares, for US$202k. Overall, American Airlines Group insiders were net buyers last year. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that American Airlines Group insiders own 1.2% of the company, worth about US$151m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders. It is good to see recent purchasing. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest American Airlines Group insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. Nice! Of course, the future is what matters most.

4,'Bank stocks have recession prices without a recession:' Mike Mayo,"‘Bank stocks have recession prices without a recession,’ Wells Fargo’s Mike Mayo says. Citigroup stock could ‘double’. MORE IN TRADING","Top banking analyst Mike Mayo is advising investors to buy beaten-down financials — not sell them. “U.S. bank stocks have recession prices without a recession,” Wells Fargo’s managing director of large cap banks told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Wednesday. “Valuations sure are attractive here.” Mayo, who is one of Institutional Investor’s most accurate analysts, isn’t denying lower Treasury yields are creating risks for the space. However, he doesn’t see the bearish scenario sticking around more than a few months. “There is likely to be near-term pain if the current rate environment stays at the current level,” Mayo said. “There could be a little pain as people incorporate potentially lower earnings estimates into the next quarter ahead.” And, he believes the bearish backdrop could change on a dime. “You’re always one tweet away,” said Mayo, referring to President Donald Trump’s Twitter habits. “You reconcile the trade agreement with China, and then this is a very sensitive group on the upside.” In a note this week, Mayo focused on his bullish risk-to-reward scenario for bank stocks over the next one to three years. He acknowledged the “very rapid decline in the 10-year Treasury yield ... coupled with the Fed July rate cut, increases the risk that bank net interest margins could decline more than expected” in the third quarter. But Mayo added the latest Fed stress test results is reassuring that record high capital will remain. “Look, there are tail risks in both directions,” he said. “So, short-term caution, [but] long-term phenomenal opportunity.” Mayo, who does not have a single sell rating in his coverage universe, picks Citigroup as his best long-term play in this environment. The stock has tumbled by more than 8% over the past five trading sessions and is now down 10% over the past 12 months. “Citigroup is buying back more stock than ever before relative to its market cap. It’s really crazy,” he said. “They should be selling the forks, the spoons, the silverware for their dining rooms to buy back more stock. They should be selling office chairs. They should take pictures off the walls. I mean it’s that attractive.” By buying back stock below tangible book value and cutting costs, Mayo predicts the bank’s shares will rip higher. “This stock could double over the next three to four years,” Mayo said.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks. Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels. Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today. One company value investors might notice is Lenovo (LNVGY). LNVGY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.21. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.16. Over the last 12 months, LNVGY's Forward P/E has been as high as 20.46 and as low as 8.90, with a median of 14.40. LNVGY is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.66. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. LNVGY's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.73. Over the last 12 months, LNVGY's PEG has been as high as 1.88 and as low as 1.47, with a median of 1.64. Finally, investors will want to recognize that LNVGY has a P/CF ratio of 6.62. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 11.22. LNVGY's P/CF has been as high as 12.11 and as low as 6.06, with a median of 8.18, all within the past year.

Heading into the opener of a three-game interleague series in Milwaukee on Friday, the Brewers are in the thick of the chase among several teams dueling for the two wild-card spots in the National League, while the Rangers have fallen several games behind in the American League race. Milwaukee (60-56) rebounded nicely from being swept last weekend at the Chicago Cubs by sweeping a three-game series in Pittsburgh. The Brewers scored 21 runs in Pittsburgh after scoring five times against the Cubs. In Wednesday's 8-3 win, rookie Keston Hiura homered twice and drove in three runs after getting four hits in his previous 28 at-bats. ""That's the baseball season, man,"" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. ""I'm proud of our guys. There's not going to be quit. There's not going to be feeling sorry for ourselves. ... You look at the standings, and it tells you you're right in it."" Milwaukee played without slugger Christian Yelich (back) on Wednesday but is hopeful he can play Friday. Yelich has coped with back spasms and stiffness this season, problems caused by baserunning, according to Counsell. Texas (58-56) is making its first trip to Milwaukee since 2013 and resides seven games behind Tampa Bay for the second wild-card spot. The Rangers began this month by scoring 19 runs in a three-game sweep of Detroit but mustered just two runs in losing two of three games in Cleveland. The Rangers managed 15 hits, struck out 32 times and went 0-for-9 with runners in scoring position against the Indians. The Rangers claimed a 1-0 victory Monday but dropped Wednesday's doubleheader, 2-0 and 5-1. They are 8-14 in their past 22 games. ""I don't like losing, and I don't like scoring two runs in three games,"" said Rangers manager Chris Woodward. ""Clearly the Indians are doing something right on that side, but our guys need to ask themselves, 'How do I do better next time?'

Focus: Canadian equities MARKET OUTLOOK We follow top-down economic and market indicators to help us to determine if our portfolios are on offence or defence at any given time. Currently, the indicators have been resilient on multiple data points. We’ve started to see some of the leading indicators showing signs of improvements (such as the Chemical Activity Barometer). We have also seen some of the shorter-term indicators showing improvement (such as the Citi Economic Surprise Index). The top-down technical indicators that we follow experienced weakness during the last few weeks. It looks like we may be set for some choppy up and down volatility over the next couple months. This volatility may present opportunities as we’re also seeing some underperforming sectors starting to show the initial signs of bottoming (energy and cannabis). These sectors could be the leaders in the next uptrend. TOP PICKS Bruce Campbell of StoneCastle Investment shares his top picks: Indus Holdings, K92 Mining and C21 Holdings. INDUS HOLDINGS (INDS.CD)

The airline had reported a PAT of Rs 56.3 crore in the March quarter of FY19 (Q4FY19).
This was the airline's biggest ever quarterly profit, as it flew more passengers and raised fares in the wake of the collapse of Jet Airways. The profit was also boosted by other income of Rs 143.2 crore in Q1 (against Rs 32.89 crore) including Rs 114.1 crore towards reimbursements from Boeing against revenue loss incurred due to grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. ""On the grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, the company continues to incur various costs with respect to these aircraft and during this quarter ended June 2019 on account of its inability to undertake revenue operations, the company has recognised Rs 114.1 crore towards aircraft and supplemental lease rentals as other income. This is a part recognition of the total reimbursements, on which the company is working with the aircraft manufacturer, towards various ascertained costs and losses incurred by the company on this aircraft,"" the company explained. The profit beat analysts’ expectations. Edelweiss Securities, for instance, had pegged the profit at Rs 154 crore. The budget carrier’s total income came in at Rs 3,145.3 crore for the quarter ending June 2019. The same was Rs 2,253.3 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal while it was Rs 2,571.8 crore in Q4FY19.

15,Indian domestic aviation recovers from Jet Airway demise; demand picks up in June - The Financial Express,Indian domestic aviation recovers from Jet Airway demise; demand picks up in June. Indian aviation sector for domestic flights seems,"Indian aviation sector for domestic flights seems to have recovered from the sudden crash of Naresh Goyal-founded Jet Airways as the demand witnessed a single digit upsurge in June 2019. “India’s domestic market continues to recover from the demise of Jet Airways, with demand rising 7.9% in June compared to the year-ago period,” according to IATA’s global aviation results. India is a crucial market for Asia-Pacific region as 45% of domestic travel of the region comes from India, China and Japan. Also, Asia Pacific is the largest aviation market globally with over one-third passenger traffic emerging from this region.  The global aviation sector has also seen an uptick in passenger growth by 5%, but the same has borne the brunt of the ongoing trade war between the world’s two largest economies — the US and China — and is not at par with the previous growth. “Ongoing trade disputes are contributing to declining global trade and slowing traffic growth. These developments are not helpful to the global economic outlook,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO, said. Meanwhile, Indian aviation has been in distress for some time now. Earlier in the year, entire Boeing 737 MAX fleet was grounded after the Ethiopian plane crash tragedy. This was followed by an abrupt suspension of Jet Airways’ operations after the airline struggled to clear off debts. While domestic carriers like SpiceJet, IndiGo and Vistara moved to fill the void created by Jet Airways, the domestic aviation sector faced a severe flight crunch for some months before abundant flights were introduced back. Jet Airways was dragged to insolvency proceedings after the SBI-led consortium of lenders got impatient with sluggish resolution of the grounded airline. Jet Airways has thousands of crores worth debt that needs to be paid to lenders, employees, service providers and bank.  India’s largest carrier by passenger number, IndiGo, has also faced some turbulence in the past month with a public spat between its two founders Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia. The former has accused Rahul Bhatia’s InterGlobe aviation of serious governance lapses and unusual control over the airline’s crucial matters. The capital market regulatory body SEBI is now overseeing the matter.

16,"Airlines can't bar pit bulls or other breeds from cabins, feds say - Los Angeles Times","Airlines can’t bar pit bulls or other breeds from cabins, feds say. Around the Web. Fighting Diabetes? This Discovery Leaves","A month after a flight attendant was bitten by an emotional support animal, the U.S. Department of Transportation told the airline industry Thursday that carriers can’t bar certain dog breeds because airlines deem them dangerous, handing a victory to pit bull fans. But the federal agency gave airlines the green light to require passengers to produce records on vaccinations and training to determine if a specific animal poses a threat on a plane. And bans on certain species — snakes, for instance — will be allowed to stand. The effort by the Department of Transportation to clarify its policy on animals in planes is the latest chapter in the long-running saga over emotional support animals. An increasing number of airplane passengers have been bringing animals, some quite exotic, contending that they were needed for emotional support during flights; airlines suspected the passengers were merely trying to save money. To control the proliferation, Southwest, JetBlue and United, among others, last year began tightening restrictions on airborne animals, particularly the unusual species. Delta Air Lines’ ban last year of all “pit bull-type dogs” as service animals or emotional support animals proved especially controversial. An airline trade group and a flight attendants union voiced support for the federal agency’s efforts to clarify its rules regarding animals. The Department of Transportation is expected to begin enforcing the guidelines later this year after they are published as part of a formal “notice of proposed rulemaking.” Sara Nelson, president of the Assn. of Flight Attendants-CWA, called the new guidelines “an important step to address what has become a mess of animals loose in the aircraft cabin.” Airlines for America, a trade group for the country’s largest carriers, said that many fliers have been fraudulently passing off their pets as emotional support animals to avoid having to pay animal transport fees. “With over a million passengers bringing [emotional support animals] on flights last year, airlines and airports saw a sharp increase in incidents such as biting and mauling by untrained animals,” the group said. “The DOT’s guidance is an important step toward addressing this growing problem and ensuring a safer and healthier travel experience for all.”  United Airlines, one of the country’s biggest carriers, reported a 75% increase in emotional support animals on flights in 2017 compared with 2016. Along with the increase has come a rise in incidents of animals urinating, defecating, biting and barking","Aug 8, 2019",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-08/airlines-cant-bar-pit-bulls-or-other-breeds
17,"REITs, hotels and airlines to benefit from Malaysia’s 2020 tourism campaign",. ,"Malaysia has set a target of 30m tourist arrivals and RM100b in tourist receipts next year as part of its campaign By MARK RAO / Pic By TMR File REAL estate investment trusts (REITs), hotels and retailers will reap benefits if the country succeeds in wooing a higher number of tourists under its concerted visit Malaysia year programme. The hospitality sector and local airlines will also benefit from the higher tourist arrivals next year, but the latter faces a bearish outlook as high oil prices and competition erode earnings. Malaysia has set a target of 30 million tourist arrivals and RM100 billion in tourist receipts next year as part of its Visit Truly Asia Malaysia 2020 campaign. JF Apex Securities Bhd head of research Lee Chung Cheng said the hotel and hospitality, airline and retail sectors will benefit from higher tourist arrivals, including REITs with a retail focus. “Companies like Pavilion REIT, for example, will benefit in this scenario. REITs are also seen as defensive stocks which not only benefit from higher tourism activities, but become attractive during a market downturn,” he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR). He said the valuations of the stocks within these three sectors are neither too expensive, nor too cheap today. While not providing any buying opportunities in that respect, these counters will benefit from the higher tourist arrivals. REITs are a popular investment option for traders looking to reap sustainable returns at relatively lowrisk profiles. However, a weaker economic forecast and a bearish property market are challenging shareholders’ returns for these funds which predominately derive their income from rental yields. KLCC Property Holdings Bhd and KLCC REIT — collectively known as KLCCP Stapled Group — are together the largest-listed REIT in Malaysia today, and its retail portfolio includes stakes in Suria KLCC and five-star hotel Mandarin Oriental. The majority of Pavilion REIT’s retail assets are located within Kuala Lumpur’s Golden Triangle, including Pavilion Mall and Intermark Mall, while IGB REIT owns two retail properties, namely Mid Valley Megamall and The Gardens Mall. CapitaLand Malaysia Mall Trust and Hektar REIT are among the other REITs with a retail focus. These funds — alongside hotel and hospitality groups such as Shangri-La Hotels (M) Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd and YTL Hospitality REIT — are expected to benefit from a booming tourism industry. Local airlines would also benefit, as higher tourist arrivals should translate into higher passenger traffic.","Aug 9, 2019",https://themalaysianreserve.com/2019/08/09/reits-hotels-and-airlines-to-benefit-from-malaysias-2020-tourism-campaign/
18,Is Now the Right Time to Invest in Delta Air Lines?,Is Now the Right Time to Invest in Delta Air Lines?. Delta’s strong quarterly results. Analysts’ bullish recommendations,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Delta Air Lines (DAL) may be an interesting investment choice right now, given the many factors that could boost its stock price in the near term. A major positive for Delta is its lack of exposure to Boeing’s (BA) 737 MAX planes. The jets have been under a flying ban since mid-March, following two deadly crashes within five months. As a result, many of Delta’s peers are facing thousands of flight cancellations monthly. Together, Southwest Airlines (LUV), American Airlines (AAL), and United Airlines (UAL) own 72 MAX aircraft. During its second-quarter earnings release, Southwest revealed 20,000 of its flights had been canceled since the MAX grounding. Meanwhile, American and United had to remove 7,800 and 3,440 flights from their schedules, respectively, in the second quarter. These cancellations have cost the companies billions of dollars in revenue and operating profit. According to OAG Aviation Worldwide, LUV, AAL, and UAL could lose 6.3 million seats in capacity if MAX planes remain grounded until October. The airline data provider estimates that the grounding could cost US airlines $4 billion in revenue and associated expenses. During their latest earnings releases, Southwest and American both disclosed that the MAX grounding impacted their second-quarter pretax income by $175 million. However, United Airlines’ pretax margin improved due to its efficient cost management and lower fuel costs. Delta has a history of beating analysts’ earnings estimates, having surpassed their forecast for the last eight quarters. The company’s top- and bottom-line results for the second quarter again beat analysts’ estimate and improved significantly YoY (year-over-year). Delta’s focus on enhancing its premium products and non-ticket sources has continued to support its revenue growth. Furthermore, the company is efficiently managing its non-fuel expenses through cost-control measures, fleet transformation, and One Delta initiative. This strategy helped the airline expand its adjusted pretax operating margin by 190 basis points YoY to 15.9% in the second quarter. The company started the third quarter on a strong note, as reflected in its August 2 operating performance report. In July, Delta’s traffic grew 5.2% YoY. It grew more than its capacity, which expanded by 3.5%. With its traffic outpacing its capacity, the company’s load factor grew by 140 basis points to 90%. Buoyed by its strong first-half performance and customer-focused initiatives, Delta raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2019. It now anticipates its revenue to grow 6%–7% YoY instead of 5%–7%.
