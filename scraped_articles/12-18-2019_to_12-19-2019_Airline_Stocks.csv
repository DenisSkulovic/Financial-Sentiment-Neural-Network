""For 2020, we see another healthy year of industry profits (albeit at modestly lower margins) ... driven by an improved outlook for global GDP, growing share of ancillary revenue (which tends to be more profitable and stable than passenger airline revenue), and strong free-cash-flow generation,"" Linenberg wrote. Risk related to additional capacity coming online when Boeing  (BA) - Get Report gets the 737 MAX back up and flying is now reflected in the share prices, he said.  On the other hand, valuations at American, Alaska Air, Southwest and United may not yet reflect the prospect that Boeing will pay potentially ""substantial"" compensation to the airlines, he said. The 737 MAX was grounded last spring after two crashes, in Ethiopia and Indonesia, over five months in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people.  The Chicago aerospace giant recently said it would indefinitely suspend production of the 737 MAX after the plane failed to meet the company's target for recertification by the Federal Aviation Administration. In particular to Delta, Linenberg wrote, the carrier is on track to grow revenue 7% in 2019 and it targets 4% to 6% growth in 2020.

""Bolstering that view are the above-average growth rates of the company's other revenue segments, such as ancillary, loyalty, and maintenance, repair and overhaul, as well as more exposure to international markets, which are growing at a faster rate than the U.S. market (and some of these segments are higher margin than the core business).""","Dec 18, 2019",https://www.thestreet.com/investing/delta-air-upgraded-to-buy-at-deutsche
1,"A Decade After Bankruptcy And Merger, Delta Is On Top And Pulling Away From The Pack","MORE FROM FORBES. A Decade After Bankruptcy And Merger, Delta Is On Top And Pulling Away From The Pack. How","What a difference a decade makes. At this time in 2009, Delta Air Lines was just beginning to stagger to its feet after losing $15.8 billion over the previous five years, making a long run through bankruptcy and merging with another carrier that had also just gone through bankruptcy, Northwest Airlines, in hopes that somehow two drunks could help each other return to financial sobriety. Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian is busy these days touting his company's huge turnaround over the last ... [+] Nevertheless, against long odds it worked. Ten years later, formerly weak and wounded Delta sits atop the global airline industry, more than a third larger, with five straight years of $5 billion-plus annual pre-tax profits (including 2019) totaling nearly $30 billion. What’s more, the Atlanta-based carrier is positioned to kick butt and take names in the years ahead after evolving in recent years to become: PROMOTED   Therefore, it’s with some justification that airline analysts on Wall Street can’t seem to contain their praise for Delta these days. Since the carrier hosted its annual investor day event at its Atlanta headquarters earlier this month, a number of big name analysts have raised their target share price for Delta over the next one to two years to the $67-$69 range. Currently Delta trades at around $58-$59. So that means analysts now expect the company’s shares to increase by as much 20% in value over the next 12 to 24 months. For a company that was considered a weak sister 10 years ago in a chronic money-losing industry, Delta’s turnaround, while not exactly new news anymore, is still rather astounding. Sure, as an airline, Delta remains subject to way too many kinds of risk to completely enumerate here. But some of the most obvious ones would be:   So, those who would take Delta’s current string of impressive successes and analysts’ almost unrestrained cheering from the sidelines as signals that it’s okay to bet heavily on airline stocks now should remember the old saw: “the way to make a million dollars in the airline business is to start with a billion dollars.” But for those willing to accept a higher-than-average amount of investment risk and who have determined to buy into today’s more rationally structured and operated airline industry, Delta is probably the pick of the litter right now.

Key Words. How Greta Thunberg and,"Climate change is guilting a growing group of travelers into keeping their feet on the ground. And in Sweden, where teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, 16, has led the charge to eschew air travel altogether, the growing stigma against leaving a large carbon footprint has allowed the term “flygskam” — Swedish for “flight shame” — to take off in Europe. In fact, the number of people flying between German cities dropped 12% in November from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg report of ADV industry group data, which showed the fourth straight month that airline passengers have decreased. Meanwhile, the Deutsche Bahn AG railway service reported record rider numbers. This has also been seen in Thunberg’s home country, where Sweden’s main train operator SJ told the Associated Press earlier this year that it sold 1.5 million more tickets in 2018 than the previous year, as more people ride the rails to reduce their own carbon emissions. The train company reported that the number of business passengers rose 12% in the first three months of this year. And this has led to Swedish terms such as like tågskryt (“train-bragging”) and att smygflyga (“to fly in secret”) also becoming buzzwords. The Swedish Facebook group Tagsemester, or “Train Holiday,” has seen membership spike from about 3,000 people in late 2017 to 90,000 this year. And many travelers are sharing their “slow travel” plans to take a train, not a plane, under the hashtag #StayOnTheGround. Thunberg’s activism has influenced our language in other ways, such as Oxford Dictionaries naming “climate emergency” as its word of the year, and the Collins Dictionary bestowing the same honor on “climate strike.” While commercial flying contributes just 2.5% of all global carbon emissions, the number will rise as more people fly. The International Air Transport Association predicts that the CO2 emissions from airlines will hit 927 million tons this year. Thunberg’s climate activism has taken the world by storm in 2019. She led tens of thousands of protestors in a global climate strike in September, when she also spoke before the United Nations General Assembly and chastised world leaders. Related:Greta Thunberg has likened her Asperger syndrome to a ‘superpower’ — some Fortune 500 employers appear to agree She was recently named Time’s Person of the Year, which drew the ire of President Trump, and the defense of former first lady Michelle Obama.

News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Federated Investors’ Phil Orlando believes the S&P 500 could surge 10% and hit 3,500 by spring. But the firm’s chief equity market strategist warns the rally will likely sour by midyear. Orlando isn’t blaming fundamentals. Rather, he ties the trouble to uncertainty surrounding the 2020 presidential election. “There’s likely to be some increased volatility,” he told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “If you’re looking at the year in total, I’d respectfully suggest that maybe it’s a barbell-shaped year: a good start to the year, some volatility in the middle and we end the year in really good shape.” Orlando, a long-time bull who came into 2019 with a 3,100 S&P 500 price target, is known for vigorously defending his optimistic stance around last December’s market meltdown. He called the bears “shameless” and tried to sooth investor fears. “The heroic call was going from 2,350 last Christmas Eve to where we are now which is up 36% in less than a year,” he said. At this juncture, he believes the economy is showing signs of firing on all cylinders. “The economy is actually starting to reaccelerate off of this trough that we put in over the last couple of months,” said Orlando. “We’ve seen the downturn. Now, we’re going to start to reaccelerate we think over the course of calendar 2020.” He lists good numbers on industrial production and capacity utilization. Orlando notes that the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, otherwise known as JOLTS, is starting to improve, and he highlights stronger than expected housing data. “Getting a little bit more corporate earnings growth based upon a reacceleration of economic growth and still relatively benign price-to-earnings ratios, that gets us to that 3,500 level,” Orlando said. Despite his forecast for midyear turbulence, he expects the noise around the presidential election will resolve itself favorably with a business-friendly candidate winning. Orlando said it doesn’t matter whether it’s a Democrat or Republican. “We [will] end up with good election results from a fiscal policy standpoint and we end the year on a high note,” Orlando said.

USD/JPY.,"                                                    JetBlue’s CEO Robin Hayes has cleared his stock for landing into your portfolio in 2020. And so has many folks on Wall Street. “I think we will have one of the strongest earnings growth stories of anyone in the [airline] industry from 2019 to 2020,” Hayes remarked on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. Hayes said he is “confident” in JetBlue (JBLU) hitting its $2.50 to $3.00 a share profit outlook originally shared at an investor day in September 2018. Somewhat oddly, JetBlue’s stock continues to trade as if the company isn’t one of the best run airlines around (it generally is seen that way) and it won’t see major earnings growth acceleration in 2020 (even though it very likely will). At a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 7.8 times, according to Yahoo Finance data, JetBlue’s stock trades at a noticeable discount relative to airline rivals Delta (DAL) (8.9 times) and SouthWest (LUV) (10.3 times). JetBlue’s stock — trading at about $18 at last check — is hovering around the company’s $16.50 a share book value, per Yahoo Finance data. Meanwhile, the Street is only modeling JetBlue’s earnings of $2.39 a share in 2020, well below the outlook Hayes reiterated once again on Yahoo Finance’s airwaves. Hayes acknowledges the Street is concerned about the revenue environment for JetBlue and the industry at large in 2020, amid fears of excess capacity. But what the market may be forgetting are the below the revenue line items poised to juice JetBlue’s earnings in 2020. For one, JetBlue is nearing the end of hitting its target of lowering expenses by close to $300 million. In October, the company unveiled a new $800 million stock buyback plan. And it’s in the midst of a major fleet overhaul which will likely boost productivity. The best of all? JetBlue only flies Airbus planes, removing the headline risk in 2020 from Boeing’s ongoing 737 Max debacle. “We continue to believe that JetBlue’s structural cost program and changes to its fleet will drive 2020 unit costs ex-fuel down year-over-year and that the company has several revenue initiatives that should","Dec 18, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jet-blue-ceo-our-growth-will-be-the-strongest-in-the-industry-in-2020-210347081.html

Boeing 737 MAX airplanes.","  A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.  Another day, another Boeing headline
. For now it’s all a lot of noise. But if Boeing stock drops meaningfully below $320, watch out.  It almost happened Tuesday. Boeing (BA) stock fell 4.3% on Monday on reports that it was planning to halt production of its 737 MAX, and then looked set to fall again Tuesday after the company confirmed those reports and Southwest Airlines (LUV) removed 737 MAX flights from its schedule through April 13. But not quite. Boeing stock traded as low as $320.61 today—a 2% loss—before bouncing. It closed unchanged at $327.00. That Boeing bounced where it did isn’t a surprise. The stock has been trading in a range so obvious, even this amateur technician can see it. And it’s a range that has existed since Jan. 2018, or nearly two years. The only breaks occurred when the market fell apart in December of 2018
—Boeing closed as low as $294.16. When the market started rallying back in January, Boeing did too—big time. It closed as high as $440.62 in March 2019. Then the first 737 MAX crashed
and the stock fell immediately back into its range.   Many Wall Street analysts aren’t worried, despite the news that Boeing is taking a break from manufacturing 737s. “Although investors are rightly seeing the 737 production halt as a negative development for Boeing, it is arguably better than continuing to pile up 737 inventory with no immediate prospect of the MAX returning to service,” Robert Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research, wrote in a report on Tuesday. “Buying MAX related dips below $350 have worked all year, and so we’re sticking with the tactic here.” But the problems with the MAX appear to be putting pressure on Boeing’s free cash flow, enough that it could the catalyst that forces the stock out of its range. “We have expected the BA stock to remain in a trading range until the FCF outlook can be better understood, which still is likely to put pressure on the BA stock,” writes Baird analyst Peter Arment. “An 8-10% FCF yield is the most likely setting out level, which potentially puts sub-$300 per share for the BA stock in play near term.” Who is right?

8,Why Booking Holdings Is a Better Investment Than Expedia | The Motley Fool,"Why Booking Holdings Is a Better Investment Than Expedia. The online travel agencies may compete in the same industry, but","   Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) are both online platforms that facilitate the process of making travel arrangements such as buying airline tickets and making hotel reservations. However, the two companies are quite different and their financial results show it. The key difference between Booking Holdings and Expedia is the markets they serve. Expedia derives a majority of its business from the United States while Booking Holdings primarily operates in Europe. At first blush, this might seem like a minor detail, but it is crucial to understanding the financial performances of the two companies. Although online travel booking websites help users book a wide variety of accommodations including flights, rental cars, and local excursions, commissions on hotel rooms provide them with the vast majority of their profits due to higher commission rates. Websites like Expedia.com can collect as much as a 20% commission on the price of a hotel accommodation. But the hotel markets in Europe and North America are quite different. While the United States is dominated by chains such as Hilton and Marriott, the European hotel market is primarily served by smaller boutique hotels. Large hotel chains control tens of thousands of rooms and centrally negotiate their contracts with online travel agencies, which allows them to secure more favorable contract terms and lower commission rates. As a result, Expedia on average collects much lower commissions on its hotel business than Booking Holdings, which is a big reason why the Europe-centric company delivers higher profit margins. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The other major difference between Booking and Expedia is their go-to-market strategy. Expedia was built around a patchwork of website properties it acquired over the years including Hotels.com, Orbitz, and Travelocity. By contrast, Booking Holdings still generates most of its revenue from its namesake Booking.com platform. Branding matters. In Europe, Booking.com is a more dominant platform. There are certainly competitors, but it has a larger market share than similar websites in other regions. As a result, most of Booking.com's traffic comes from users who go to it directly, rather than being directed to it by a search engine. This significantly reduces its paid advertising costs. Expedia certainly gets a lot of direct traffic to its website, but user behavior in North America tends to start with search engines like Google. For this reason, paid advertising costs eat up a larger portion of Expedia's revenue, again resulting","Dec 19, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/19/booking-holdings-better-investment-than-expedia.aspx

One thing nearly everyone can agree on about,"Getty Images One thing nearly everyone can agree on about the past decade is that it has been very, very good for stock market investors. The Russell 1000 large-company index, which tracks the 1,000 biggest U.S. stocks by market value, has gained roughly 252% since the start of the 2010s, including reinvested dividends. Some stocks have done far better. Microsoft (MSFT) awoke from its long slumber and jumped 545% over the past decade. Dollar General (DG) made a lot of bucks, gaining 632%. And Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has made a lovely 1,325% gain. But those aren't the tippy-top stocks of the Russell 1000. Not even close. Here are the top 10 large-company stocks of the decade, as well as a look at what put them on top of the heap. We chose the Russell 1000 because it offers an even broader look at the stock market than the S&P 500, but still excludes smaller companies where extremely outsize gains are more common and can more easily come from a single, quick driver. 1 of 10 Getty Images Pumps and valves are not exactly the most high-tech gadgets around – but they can be, if you put them on commercial and military aircraft. In Transdigm's fiscal 2019 ended Sept. 30, the company sold about $5.2 billion worth of those components. When you consider that the company did about $828 million in revenues in fiscal 2010, you start to get an idea of what propelled TransDigm into the ranks of the decade's top stocks. In 2019, TDG has delivered a 77.6% total return, thanks in part to decent organic growth as well as bolt-on gains from the acquisition of manufacturer Esterline. Shareholders also benefited from a $30-per-share special dividend – it's among a handful of stocks that have paid several special dividends in recent years. From here?

Two more entities have expressed early interest in Jet Airways, the","By Anwesha Ganguly Two more entities have expressed early interest in Jet Airways, the company’s resolution professional, Ashish Chhawchharia, told the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday. The Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Jet Airways on Tuesday in-principle agreed to formally call for fresh expressions-of-interest. So far, the Colombian Synergy Group was the only one in talks to revive the grounded airline. “The group’s draft business plan is not compliant with the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process. We will need a final resolution plan and further commitments from Synergy Group. Their interest is conditional on assurance on Heathrow, Amsterdam and India slots, which the CoC cannot give. The two other parties only expressed their interest two days ago. Instead of extending the time period just for this one group, the CoC decided to call for fresh bids. Final decision is expected by Saturday,” a person aware of the developments said. The Synergy Group will now have to put in a fresh EoI during the next round. Among the two new players, one is an Indian entity backed by a UK-based investor and the other is a fund based in West Asia, the person said. Meanwhile, senior officials of ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) told the tribunal that the government will “positively consider” any business plan for Jet Airways. “If slots are not used, they are perishable and the public gets inconvenienced. Whenever they (Synergy Group) give a confirmed plan, certainly we are open to examining that,” Usha Padhee, joint secretary, MoCA, told NCLT. Representatives from Colombian Synergy Group, which has been in talks with the lenders to invest in the grounded airline, will meet the two-member bench of the Mumbai NCLT on Thursday. The bench had sought the group’s appearance before court to assess its seriousness about bidding of Jet Airways. Most of Jet’s erstwhile domestic slots have been re-allocated to other carriers till March 2020 after the airline was grounded eight months ago. Some of them have been allotted to Air India till October 2020. The RP on Tuesday told the bench that Synergy Group last week presented a draft business plan.

IAG:LSE. .,"When International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) was formed in 2011, bringing together national carriers British Airways and Iberia, consolidation was an idea at the heart of the venture. This November, the company announced a major deal to buy Air Europa, which, if approved by regulators, could provide a major boost. Meanwhile, tough trading during 2019 has seen the industry rein in its growth plans, which should help underpin ticket prices. Add this to the track record established by IAG since its creation and an unchallenging valuation, and we think it is time to switch tack on the shares and change our recommendation from sell to buy. Air Europa acquisition Reduced industry capacity growth Norwegian Shuttle route cancellation Cost-cutting Recent tough trading Stikes not officially resolved The acquisition of Air Europa, costing €2.4bn including debt, would make IAG the market-leading airline serving the South Atlantic from Europe. If cleared, the deal would be expected to complete in the second half of 2020. As well as gaining lucrative routes from the acquisition, based on past experience investors should be able to expect major cost savings. Indeed, Europa would be the fifth acquisition for IAG since its formation, which includes the purchase of assets from Monarch after its administration.   International Consolidated Airlines Group SA  IAG’s solid financial position means it can fund the deal with borrowings, while keeping net debt/cash profits (Ebitda) some way below its 1.8 times target. Importantly, IAG’s structure lends itself to consolidation. Its four airlines – British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling – operate independently, but share central functions. Meanwhile, capital allocation decisions are made at group level. This has served IAG shareholders well since 2011 as measured by growth in return on invested capital (ROIC), with the group’s target to maintain ROIC at an industry-leading 15 per cent or more.  Part of IAG’s success in raising ROIC has been thanks to its ability to cut costs. Between 2010 and 2018, cost per average seat kilometre, excluding fuel, has fallen 10.7 per cent and further reductions of 1 per cent a year are targeted in the three years to 2022. IAG thinks it can unlock another level of synergies by performing more core airline activities at the group level, including loyalty schemes, fleet management, sales and pricing.  The competitive environment also appears to be becoming more favourable due to falling airline capacity growth.

Travel annual airline survey. Holidaymakers panned BA for the quality of its food and drink, the comfort of its seats and value for money for its short-haul and long haul services with both only managing a 55 per cent customer score overall. The consumer champion asked more than 6,500 holidaymakers to rate their experiences of flights taken over the course of 12 months. Passengers were asked to describe their experiences of customer service, boarding and cabin environment. Once-loved British Airways was the third from the bottom of the short-haul table and fared even worse when it came to its long haul offering where it was second from the bottom. The British flag carrier was awarded the best short-haul airline in the Which? Travel survey in 2015 but subsequent IT failures, strikes and mass cancellations have contributed to the descent of the airline in customers’ estimations. Some passengers had such bad experiences they told Which? they would never fly British Airways again with one going as far as to say “BA is, without doubt, the worst airline we’ve ever used.” Ryanair was voted the worst short-haul airline, a dubious accolade which it has flirted with for the last four consecutive years, with a dismal score of only 44 per cent. Many passengers who had flown with the budget carrier pointed out the endless add ons and the finicky luggage requirements with one saying customers were treated like ‘cash cows’ and another carried on the analogy by saying the airline had a ‘cattle class mentality’. Customers gave the airline the lowest possible score of one star out of a possible five in all categories including boarding, customer service and cabin experience, apart from value for money where it managed a two-star rating.

17,Boeing Made These Shrewd Moves to Fend off Investor Revolt. Will it Last? | Fortune,Boeing Made These Shrewd Moves to Fend off Investor Revolt. Will it Last?. Business reality. Signaling confidence. Call for the,"December 18, 2019 2:28 PM GMT+2      Tuesday should have been the worst of all days for Boeing. The day before, the company announced that it would halt production of its fast-selling but troubled aircraft, the 737 MAX next month.  Then, Tuesday morning, Boeing said it had no plans to lay anyone off because of the stoppage, and that yes, dear shareholders, it would continue to pay out its dividend. Had corporate management gone loopy? Announcing a quarterly dividend payment worth about $1.2 billion and, the morning after, ruling out layoffs following a production halt on its star product—a decision that led major customer Southwest Airlines to delay the MAX's debut on its flight schedule from March 6 to April 13, 2020—would normally be the kind of behavior that would set investors' heads spinning with doubts. But ultimately the market didn't blink. Since the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people and led to the grounding of the airplane in March, Boeing's stock trajectory has resembled something like a flight rocked by violent mid-air turbulence—dropping from a high of $440.62 in February to a low near $320 in August. On Tuesday, Boeing's global suppliers saw their shares take a hit, with General Electric, which makes the MAX engines, falling 0.63%. But Boeing's own shares ended the day flat at $327, recovering from an early sell-off. The question, then, is why the market didn't punish the Chicago-based planemaker on such a traumatic day. The answer: steady moves and positioning on Boeing's part, and the bottom-line realities of its business. First, the bigger reality. No ifs, ands, or buts. The company has taken a big hit over the MAX, and the decision to stop making the plane—however long the hiatus lasts—is serious. ""For them to halt production means there are sales that are permanently lost,"" says James Angel, professor of finance at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. But while virtually all the talk about the company these days focuses on the MAX, Boeing is more than this one product line. Boeing has three separate divisions: commercial airlines; defense, space, and security; and global services—and the two business segments that don't involve the 737 MAX grew year-over-year. The table below shows the revenues for each in the first nine months of both 2018 and 2019.
