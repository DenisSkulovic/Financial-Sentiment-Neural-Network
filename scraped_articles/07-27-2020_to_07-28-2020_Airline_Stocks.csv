The sector continues to struggle amid the pandemic. By: Simon Chandler | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. Airline stocks have lost millennials over 50% in the year to date, according to data from S&P and Bloomberg. This dramatic decline comes as internet retail industry stocks (including Amazon) have risen by over 55% across the same period. Millennial traders have been piling into airline stocks in recent months. Users of Robinhood–popular with millennials–went crazy for airline ETFs in May. With airline stocks still fading, millennials have demonstrated poor judgment. Rather than rationally evaluate the real prospects of airlines, they simply followed the herd. The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the airline industry hard. Even veteran fund manager Warren Buffet dumped his stocks in four airlines in early May. Shares in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)) fell by nearly 70% between mid-February and early April. Millennial traders took this as a sign to buy, with AAL becoming the sixth most-bought stock on Robinhood in April. Millennials didn’t only snap up stock in individual airlines. They also went big for airline industry funds. One airline ETF–U.S. Global Jets ETF–grew from $33 million in early March to $1 billion by early June. Robinhood users were a significant driver of this rise, with the app witnessing an 8,000% increase in accounts with positions in the ETF. This gamble hasn’t paid off for millennials.

Airline stock prices are struggling to recover to pre-March levels, with most dropping by 50% to 60% in four months. By: Joseph Young | Email | Leave a comment A surge in new virus infections has forced European nations to place new travel restrictions following a growing number of local coronavirus outbreaks in clusters across the continent. Airlines across Europe, the U.S., and Asia are on the decline. Airline stock prices are struggling to recover to pre-March levels, with most dropping by 50% to 60% in four months. The Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index dropped by 2.95% on July 24, as rattled investors sold off. Europe’s biggest airlines posted significant losses on the day, as stock markets opened. Ryanair, British Airway (IAG), and Lufthansa Group plunged by 7.2%, 9.11%, and 6.22%, respectively. Throughout late May and early June, the fear of missing out (FOMO) on retail stock platforms, like Robinhood, peaked. Tens of thousands of traders were buying stocks every hour, pushing the entire stock market upwards.   Many traders seemingly bought all types of stocks, regardless of their fundamentals, fueled by surging market sentiment. Data from Robintrack.net shows that many traders are still underwater in major airline stocks. For instance, more than 300,000 users on Robinhood currently hold the United Airlines stock. On April 1, there were less than 104,000 users invested in the stock. There were early signs of trouble for airlines.

3,A Tale of 3 Airline Stocks; 2 to Buy and 1 to Hold,A Tale of 3 Airline Stocks; 2 to Buy and 1 to Hold,"The airline industry has certainly seen better days. The response to the global coronavirus pandemic has put hard restrictions on travel, especially international travel, while also putting unprecedented numbers of people out of work. It was a one-two body blow to the airlines; most people weren’t allowed to travel, and when that began to loosen, too few people had money to afford travel. The airline stocks have reacted in entirely predictable ways. They plummeted in March and February, during the general stock collapse, and have failed to regain traction since. There was an abortive rally in early June, when it appeared that travel restrictions would loosen – but that sputtered out when the virus began to spread again, prompting fears of a ‘second wave’ as well as governmental moves back toward lockdown policies. Through all of this, Savanthi Syth, 4-star analyst with Raymond James, has kept her finger on the airlines’ collective pulse. Syth has been following the industry for Raymond James for the past decade; she knows the players and the field. And in recent days, she has pointed out three airlines that deserve a second look from investors. Opening up the TipRanks stock database, we’ve pulled up Syth’s three new ratings. She rates two as Buys, and the third a Hold – but that third stock may be the real story, as her Hold represents an upgrade from Sell. Let’s take a look at Syth’s airline ratings, and find out why she is unexpectedly bullish on air travel. Southwest Airlines (LUV) We start with Southwest, the world’s largest bargain-price airline and a long-time blue-chip stalwart of the S&P 500 index. Southwest has based its market strategy on a combination of low cost and positive customer service, an approach reflected in its very stock ticker, LUV. The company’s effort has been successful, in the only way that counts. LUV finished 2019 with $2.3 billion in net income, it’s 47th profitable year in a row.  That profitability simply evaporated in 1H20, when the travel restrictions took hold. Southwest reported a loss of 15 cents per share in Q1, which deepened to an ugly $2.67 in Q2. In the earnings report, management noted the brief partial recovery in May and June, and the reversal in July. On a positive note, Southwest reported good liquidity, with $14.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the end of Q2,","Jul 28, 2020",https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/a-tale-of-3-airline-stocks-2-to-buy-and-1-to-hold/

BTC-USD.,"                                                   Previous crises hit certain parts of the economy sharply, like the Global Financial Crisis for banks. But no crisis has ever hit anything harder than the coronavirus crisis has hit the travel industry. Due to the worries about Covid-19 transmission, airlines shut down completely, resulting in a shocking unemployment spike in the U.S. Along with consumer demand for flying, airline and other travel companies’ stocks cratered. And although legendary investor Warren Buffett decided to liquidate his airline stocks — which further tanked the stocks — some market watchers are very bullish on travel. Sarah Ketterer, CEO of fund manager Causeway Capital Management, which invests in airline stocks, told Yahoo Finance that she sees airline stocks like bank stocks during the 2008 financial crisis. Shares of airlines have fallen considerably: United (UAL) traded at around $81 per share in February and has fallen to $33. Delta (DAL) has similarly lost value, dropping from $55 to $26. During the financial crisis, “banks were decimated — uninvestable,” she said. “Only 12 months after, bank stocks had doubled. That’s what will happen, we believe, to the airlines.” JPMorgan traded at $19 a share in February 2009. In October of that year, a share was up to $42. The boom won’t happen to all airlines, Ketterer clarified. The better-managed ones, the low-cost carriers, the shorter-haul carriers will be the ones to bounce back, like Alaska Airlines (ALK) and Ryanair (RYAAY). Ketterer said that even during the spring there were upticks in travel and guests, indicating an appetite to travel — even without a vaccine. “You can imagine what it’ll be like when, of the 21 different vaccines between phase one and phase three, any one of those are successful,” she said. In her view, most companies involved in the travel industry are doing a good job with cleanliness and lowering risks. ""People will come back,"" she said. On the other hand, the spikes in travel were before most of the country was hit hard by the pandemic, so it’s possible that people’s thinking may have evolved as the U.S. coronavirus situation deteriorated.

9,Better Buy: Southwest Airlines vs. Spirit Airlines | The Motley Fool,Better Buy: Southwest Airlines vs. Spirit Airlines. These two airline stocks were popular with investors prior to the pandemic. Is,"   Airline stocks have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused demand for travel to plummet. Airlines big and small have been caught up in the sell-off, and with most in the industry expecting that travel volumes will need years to recover to pre-pandemic levels, there isn't much reason to get excited about buying in. But for those patient enough to ride out the storm, the sell-off has created opportunities to buy airline shares at prices well below where they were trading just a few months ago.  AIRLINE DATA BY YCHARTS Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) were two Wall Street darlings prior to the pandemic, but both stocks have been hit hard so far in 2020. Is now a good time to buy in, or do the risks still outweigh the rewards? Here's a look at both airlines to try to determine which, if either, is a better buy today. Southwest has been a relative winner among airlines, down ""only"" 41% for the year. The company has always been viewed as a relatively safe haven among airline stocks and is the only large airline that can boast it has never landed in bankruptcy. Southwest remarkably has also never had to resort to layoffs in its nearly 50-year history, and that streak seems likely to continue after the company received offers from more than 25% of its employees to take buyouts or extended leaves in order to help conserve cash. The airline will need it. Southwest reported second-quarter revenue down 82% year over year, and Southwest warned it expects third-quarter capacity to be down considerably for the remainder of 2020 compared to last year. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Southwest has been slower to pull flights than many of its rivals, keeping inventory available for sale as a way to get a real-time read on demand. The company burned through about $16 million per day in June but hopes to breakeven in the third quarter, although that would require demand holding up into the fall. Whatever happens, Southwest has the cash to survive the pandemic. The airline as of June 30 had $15.5 billion in total liquidity, or nearly two years of cash on hand, and feels good enough about its financial position that it has begun to pay back some of the higher-cost debt it took on in the early days of the","Jul 27, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/27/better-buy-southwest-airlines-vs-spirit-airlines.aspx

Holiday and airline stocks tumble as Spanish quarantine sparks fears of further travel restrictions and Ryanair slumps to £168m,"By CAMILLA CANOCCHI FOR THISISMONEY.CO.UK PUBLISHED: 10:13 GMT, 27 July 2020 | UPDATED: 11:15 GMT, 27 July 2020  68 View
comments  Airline and travel stocks are the top fallers across markets this morning amid fears of further travel restrictions after the UK Government's decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on travellers arriving from Spain.  Tui, the UK's biggest tour operator, topped the fallers' list, with shares down 15 per cent, after it cancelled all mainland Spanish holidays until 9 August. Budget airline easyjet was also deep in the red, with shares down almost 14 per cent, while British Airways owner IAG was down 10 per cent. Ryanair shares were also hammered, falling 8 per cent after the budget airline said a second wave of infections was its 'biggest fear' as the pandemic already caused it to slump to a loss in what was its 'most challenging' quarter ever. Airline and travel stocks are the biggest fallers among Britain's top 350 listed companies  Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the new restrictions show that the recovery of the travel industry 'will not be a smooth ride'. 'The market is now pricing in the risk of restrictions on more countries and thus raising the potential for earnings estimates to be downgraded once again for travel-related industries,' he said.   Desperate for business, airlines and travel companies have been lowering the price of their flights and holidays, hoping to encourage more people to book trips.  'The Government imposing restrictions puts a spanner in the works and effectively derails their strategy for clawing back some of the losses experienced earlier this year,' Mould said. He added: 'Many people don’t want to risk having to go through 14 days of quarantine after their holiday, particularly those who cannot work from home, and so it seems likely the Spain-related news will prompt more people to cancel their overseas trip this summer. It may also cause more people to think twice about booking a last-minute holiday.' There are fresh fears of further travel restrictions after the Government's decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on travellers arriving from Spain It comes as Ryanair, which started flying again in July, today unveiled a loss of €185million (£168million) in the quarter to the end of June.

11,Airline stocks drop as quarantine rules announced for UK travellers returning from Spain | London Evening Standard | Evening Standard,. . Airline stocks drop as quarantine rules announced for UK travellers returning from Spain. Related. . . Discussion. .," ravel and airline stocks took a pounding today after the government said it was watching the situation closely in Germany and France with regard to implementing quarantine measures. “We have to keep the situation under review and I think that is what the public would expect us to do,” junior health minister Helen Whately told Sky when asked about Germany and France possibly being next to face a quarantine. “If we see rates going up in a country where at the moment there is no need to quarantine, if we see the rates going up, we would have to take action because we cannot take the risk of coronavirus being spread again across the UK,” she said. It comes as over the weekend the UK abruptly imposed a two-week coronavirus quarantine on travellers returning from Spain, a decision that has left hundreds of thousands people stranded. The airline industry has reacted with dismay to the decision to impose the quarantine, calling it a big blow. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is advising against all but essential travel to mainland Spain. Quarantine measures apply to those returning from mainland Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, such as Majorca and Ibiza. British Airways is still operating flights, but said the move was ""throwing thousands of Britons' travel plans into chaos"". Yesterday the UK's biggest tour operator, Tui, cancelled all mainland Spanish holidays until 9 August. Today Ryanair posted a loss and expressed concern about a possible second wave of coronavirus in the Autumn. The company said: “It is impossible to predict how long the Covid-19 pandemic will persist, and a second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe in late autumn (when the annual flu season commences) is our biggest fear right now. “Hopefully EU governments, by implementing effective track and tracing systems, and EU citizens by complying with recommended face masks, rigorous hand hygiene and other measures, will avoid the need for further lockdowns or restrictions on intra-EU flights.” Shares in British Airways owner IAG tumbled 8%, while was EasyJet was off 12% and Wizz Air dived 5%. InterContinental Hotels Group was down 3% and Tui lost 13%.

13,What the Charts Say Now for Aal Stock After the Earnings Beat | InvestorPlace,"What the Charts Say for American Airlines Stock on Earnings Beat. AAL stock is still a dicey hold, given the"," July 23 was not an easy session in the stock market, as the S&P 500 fell more than 1.2%. However, on the other end of the spectrum, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) rallied almost 4% on better-than-expected earnings. So, is it time to buy AAL stock? When we take a look at the charts, the answer isn’t overwhelmingly bullish. Instead, it shows that longs are still struggling to gain traction — even after the quarterly results topped estimates.  Therefore, let’s break down AAL stock after the report and see why it has become a favorite for those trading in the space.  The company reported a staggering loss of $7.82 per share, which eked past estimates by 8 cents. However, after losing that much money, it’s hard to consider that a win for investors. Moreover, revenue of $1.62 billion plunged more than 84%, but beat expectations by $100 million. In all, excluding special items, American Air lost $4.7 billion in the quarter. That said, anyone that was hoping for or expecting a V-shaped recovery in the airline industry can kiss that hope goodbye.  Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) CEO Ed Bastian said it would take a couple of years to see a real recovery in the space. And while airline traffic is coming back, it’s still down considerably year-over-year, as the chart here shows.  However, for how bad of a quarter it was — to no real fault of American’s — the company did pretty well.  Overall, AAL stock ended the quarter with more than $10 billion in liquidity. The airline also cut down its cash burn, burning about $55 million per day for the quarter. In April, that figure was as high as $100 million a day. By June, the company had it down to $30 million a day.  Now, the spiking number of novel coronavirus cases is causing another dip in travel demand. From the company’s press release (bold emphasis added): “Passenger demand and load factors have improved since bottoming out in April, but continue to be significantly below 2019 levels. While May and June revenue trends were encouraging, demand has weakened somewhat during July as COVID-19 cases have increased and new travel restrictions have been put into place.” In May, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), AAL stock and others were breaking down to new post-coronavirus lows.

14,American Airlines Stock Will Remain Turbulent for Awhile | InvestorPlace,"American Airlines Stock Will Remain Turbulent for Awhile. American Airlines has enough cash to survive, but it's a risky bet"," Like its peers, the performance of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock is largely determined  by news involving the novel coronavirus.  The shares underwent a peak-to-trough decline of more than 76% when the Covid-19 shutdown went into effect in the U.S., then more than doubled in the wake of the reopenings. But the shares have since given back nearly all of their gains. With the world’s largest economy halted for much of the second quarter, hurting air travel, American lost $7.82 per share in Q2, 12 cents worse than analysts’ average estimate. But somehow the carrier notched revenue of $1.62 billion, beating the mean forecast of $1.44 billion. Consequently, the stock rose after the July 23 report. But AAL stock is still a challenged, risky name. In the near-term, American’s status as a going concern isn’t in much doubt. As of June 30, the carrier had $10.2 billion of cash, procured a $4.75 billion loan from the Treasury Department and sold $1.2 billion worth of senior notes for a combined liquidity tally of $16.2 billion. That’s more than double the company’s market capitalization. Broadly speaking, the older carriers, such as American and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), are well-capitalized and can survive for a long time. While their liquidity is crucial, investors should also consider their costs and what carriers are doing to reduce their cash-burn rates. Fortunately, American’s cash-burn rate is improving, declining to $30 million per day in June from $100 million per day in April. “This improvement was driven by higher than forecast revenue and larger savings resulting from the company’s cost-reduction initiatives,” said the carrier. “The company’s second-quarter cash burn rate was approximately $55 million per day vs. its previous forecast of $70 million per day.” In this environment, a lower burn rate is positive.  But also important is how the rate was reduced. In the case of airlines, declining daily costs were largely caused by reducing staff and cutting capacity. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE That means the outlook of American will largely be tied to coronavirus and the recent spike in cases, many of which are happening in prime summer tourist destinations, such as California and Florida. “While May and June revenue trends were encouraging, demand has weakened somewhat during July as COVID-19 cases have increased and new travel restrictions have been put into place,” according to American.","Jul 27, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/07/american-is-challenged-until-covid-19-is-adequately-dealt-with/

The Current Situation in Airline"," Airlines stocks including IAG, QAN, RLLCF, EZJ are looking for a steep downfall, The Flying Stocksman (@flyingstocksman) recommends selling. The stocks from the airline sector are having a bad day today as the price plunges significantly. The Flying Stocksman (@flyingstocksman) recommends selling while the stock price is below the cloud. Those recommendations are relevant for International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), Qantas Airways Limited (QAN), Rolls-Royce Holdings (RLLCF), and EasyJet PLC (EZJ). Airline industry has suffered a lot from the ongoing crisis as the majority of flights were canceled due to the quarantine measures. While the headlines of the most influential newspapers and magazines are focused on the growing numbers of new coronavirus cases, investors are getting rid of the stocks as they expect another wave of quarantine measures, which may cause permanent damage to the industry.  The price of this UK-based airline company’s stock is close to its lows recorded in 2020. The price started a very sharp downtrend in the end of February of 2020 and hit $2.093. Later there were some attempts to start an uptrend but they all failed due to rising fears of more quarantine measures. You can’t see much of a difference when comparing Qantas stock price with IAG. QAN started to plunge a bit earlier at the beginning of 2020 and had a significant fall towards $2.02. That was the year’s lowest point. The stock price had an attempt to gain back some positions later but currently, it has another sharp plunge due to investors’ fears. Rolls-Royce Holdings stock price has started its downtrend in February of 2020 together with IAG. Rolls-Royce specializes in producing equipment for airplanes, ships, and civil vehicles. Nowadays, both sectors are suffering from the global crisis. It is not surprising the price of the stock has reached its 2020 lowest levels and is currently close to them when fears about the new wave of quarantine measures are dominating the markets. The beginning of 2020 wasn’t the best time for EasyJet as well. The stock price plunged to 4.94 but had a smooth recovery later. EZJ targeted higher levels until the end of June when fears about new restriction measures have broken the uptrend.
