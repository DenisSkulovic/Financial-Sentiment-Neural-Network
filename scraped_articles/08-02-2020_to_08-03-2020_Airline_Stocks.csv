2,Airline Earnings Show Better Days Are Still a Ways Off for Their Stocks | The Motley Fool,Airline Earnings Show Better Days Are Still a Ways Off for Their Stocks. The second quarter was really bad for,"   When looking at airline stocks right now, it is really a question of whether you view the glass as half full or half empty. Second-quarter earnings, as expected, were woeful. But they could have been a lot worse. Travel volumes have risen dramatically from April lows, but are still just a fraction of more-normal levels. U.S. carriers have avoided bankruptcy so far, but their futures are in no way secured. It's a dangerous time to be an airline investor, but with stocks trading at below 0.5 times more normalized sales, there is the opportunity for substantial returns if the industry is able to eventually fly through this rough patch. Here are four thoughts coming out of earnings season about what's ahead for the industry. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Investors rallied into airline shares in early summer as the companies began to restore flights, hopeful that the worst was over and conditions were returning to normal. That optimism ended up being premature. Passenger volumes bottomed out on April 14, a day when the Transportation Security Administration screened just 87,000 travelers. That number has grown in the months since to more than 700,000 on many days in late July, though that is still well below the 2.7 million travelers going through U.S. airports daily a year ago. Airlines were adding flights in early summer in part because there was limited downside. A provision of the CARES Act stimulus legislation provided the industry with $25 billion to help meet payroll, conditioned on the airlines avoiding layoffs and involuntary furloughs. That means airlines were paying their employees whether they were flying or not. The payroll subsidies, coupled with cheap fuel prices and a desperate need for whatever revenue could be had, led the airlines to fly flights that might not have made economic sense in more typical times. Those conditions will unravel in the months to come. The payroll protections, and layoff restrictions, end on Sept. 30. The end of summer also means a decline in leisure demand, which was responsible for most of the resurgence. Expect airline workforces and schedules to shrink in the months to come, with a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels not likely before 2022 at the earliest. The wild card right now is Congress, and specifically whether lawmakers are receptive to calls that they extend the payroll protections for another six months. Airline unions are lobbying","Aug 2, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/02/airline-earnings-show-better-days-are-still-a-ways.aspx
3,Here Are the Top 10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood | The Motley Fool,Here Are the Top 10 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood. And the two best stocks to buy right now.. 1.,"   Stocks are America's favorite investment. More Americans believe investing in the stock market is a better option than investing in real estate over the next decade, according to a new study by Bankrate.  And, increasingly, they're turning to Robinhood to buy stocks. The commission-free stock-trading platform allows new and experienced investors alike to quickly and cost-effectively invest in their favorite companies. The following 10 stocks are currently the most popular among Robinhood's more than 10 million users. But which of them are the best buys today? BUY THE BEST. AVOID THE REST. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Seeing Ford Motor (NYSE:F) atop Robinhood's stock rankings is a bit surprising. Ford has underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin in recent years, and it's not exactly an exciting growth stock at this point.  F TOTAL RETURN PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS Ford's place at the top of this list is likely related to its low stock price, which makes it easier for investors with smaller portfolios to buy more shares. But stock price alone is not a good reason to invest in a company, particularly now that Robinhood and other brokerages allow investors to buy fractional shares. Ford is progressing with its turnaround plan, but there are better stocks for you to buy. General Electric (NYSE:GE) is another low-price stock that draws attention from value-hunters. Perhaps they should look elsewhere. Other than its relatively low price-to-cash-flow metrics, General Electric doesn't have much going for it. The coronavirus pandemic is wreaking havoc on its aviation business. Yet even before the crisis began, the struggles of several of GE's other divisions largely offset growth in its aviation and healthcare segments. Like Ford, GE is in the midst of a turnaround plan, the results of which remain uncertain. Robinhood investors seem to love beaten-down industries. But not every stock that loses a significant amount of its value recovers. On the contrary, many see their share prices continue to stagnate, and some even descend toward $0 as their businesses struggle and ultimately fail. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) certainly fits the description of a beaten-down stock. Its shares have lost more than 60% of their value in 2020 after COVID-19 devastated the airline industry. While government assistance may have helped to keep the airlines in business, it might take years before they fully recover. In the meantime, American Airlines' stock could continue to","Aug 3, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/03/here-are-the-top-10-most-popular-stocks-on-robinho.aspx

Everything is,"      Ryan Vanzo | August 2, 2020 | More on: BA CJT Investors are piling into Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) stock. It’s not hard to figure out why. From 2009 to 2019, BA shares rose 10 times in value. The coronavirus pandemic, however, turned things upside-down. Year to date, shares are down 50%, versus a 5% decline for the S&P/TSX Composite Index overall. Investors are betting that once the pandemic passes, Boeing stock will return to business as usual. That means shares could eventually double in value, back towards their previous highs. But if you want to play the rebound, don’t go with a company like Boeing. As we’ll see, there’s simply too much uncertainty here. There is one airline, however, that should perform well regardless of where the coronavirus pandemic heads. “Everything is uncertain, perhaps to a unique degree,” says Jeremy Grantham, head of GMO Asset Management. This is particularly true for the airline industry. Despite optimism a few weeks ago, the market is now preparing for an elongated recovery. On Wednesday, we learned that Boeing generated a $2.4 billion loss during the second quarter. Plane deliveries dropped by more than 70%. “The reality is the pandemic’s impact on the aviation sector continues to be severe,” warned CEO Dave Calhoun. “This pressure on our commercial customers means they are delaying jet purchases, slowing deliveries, deferring elective maintenance, retiring older aircraft and reducing spend — all of which affects our business and, ultimately, our bottom line.” The most concerning news surrounded Boeing’s estimates for a recovery. The company doesn’t think commercial air travel will normalize for another three years. New aircraft orders, meanwhile, won’t tick up for nearly five years. Despite the drop in stock prices, stay far away from traditional commercial airlines. Stay further away from businesses that rely on those companies for demand. That includes Boeing. If you’re looking to buy an airline stock, stick with Cargojet Inc (TSX:CJT). You’ve never flown with Cargojet, and you never will. That’s because the company doesn’t transport passengers.

6,Stock market today: Two top July performers could stretch rally,Two of July’s top-performing stocks could stretch a rally into August. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"A handful of stocks kicked off August on Monday with hefty July gains in the bag. L Brands, AMD, PulteGroup, Whirlpool, Hanesbrands and Qualcomm were among the top performers last month, sporting double-digits percentage gains compared with a 6% increase for the S&P 500. Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments, said chipmaker Qualcomm has the best chances in the group to continue its rally. “This is a semi that has not kept up in the multiyear rally we just experienced. They had a great quarter: They beat, they raised guidance, they’ve got Huawei contracts, they’ve got a 5G handsets. But more important to us, valuation is still attractive,” Tengler told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. Qualcomm has added 67% in the past five years, while the SMH semiconductor ETF has rallied 220%. Tengler is looking to relative dividend yield and its relative price to sales ratio as proof of potential for Qualcomm. The stock has a 2.5% dividend yield, while the SMH ETF yields 1.3%. “We think the dividend is safe, we think they can grow the dividend,” said Tengler. “It’s cheaper than in many of the others in our work. So we added to it last month, and we’re going to continue to hold it.” Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, prefers a different stock in the group. “We like Whirlpool. This is a stock that has reversed a downtrend going back to the 2017 highs, you’ve broken above your 2019 highs. It still looks like to us you’ve got about 16% to maybe about 24% upside up to the next kind of resistance levels around $188 and $200 on the chart,” he said during the same “Trading Nation” segment. Whirlpool is up 26% in the past month and 45% in three months. Shares hit a 52-week high last week.  Disclosure: Laffer Tengler Investments holds Qualcomm.  Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip?

7,Have These 3 Travel Stocks Bottomed Out?,Have These 3 Travel Stocks Bottomed Out?. The coronavirus has sent the travel industry into disarray and many businesses have,"It will be some time before many of us take-off on that international holiday we have been saving for, as the world battles to contain the deadly coronavirus. All countries are different when it comes to quarantine periods and exemptions to board a flight, but overall the aviation and travel industry has taken a huge hit. The United States government even offered some bailout money so a number of businesses wouldn’t go bust.  In the current climate, people are only booking essential flights for work or to return home. American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) has been reeling from the aftershocks of the pandemic, its stock crashing by nearly 70% between mid-February and early April. There was some positive news on June 8, when the stock went up to a recent high of $20.31, but it has been falling since then. Many investors, particularly millennials, bought American Airlines stocks with the hope it would recover quicker than it has.  The airline giant, however, did exceed analysts’ expectations at its most recent earnings call, posting $1.6 billion in revenue compared to the predicted $1.4 billion. American Airlines has also done a great job in conserving its cash burn, reporting $30 million per day for the month of June rather than the guidance of $70 million. The company did report a total loss of $3.4 billion, which was also better than initially expected.  While it seems the airline has hit rock bottom, analysts predict that it will drop close to the lows of $9 per share again. There is no sign of the coronavirus infection rate slowing down in the U.S. and it could be years before this company returns to operating at pre-coronavirus levels. While many experts believe that the longer aircrafts stay parked, the less it will cost the company, it is still burning through plenty of cash. I would wait until the shares drop again if you are wanting to invest, but be prepared to wait years before it gains momentum.  Just look at our returns versus that of the S&P 500!

The ASX’s only,"Alliance Aviation (ASX:AQZ) is one of the few airlines thriving in these difficult times (Picture: Getty) News August 3, 2020 | Nick Sundich  While most airlines are downsizing their fleets, charter airline Alliance Aviation (ASX:AQZ) is doing the opposite and expanding. Alliance has escaped the worst of COVID-19 as demand for its charter flights holds up. Having completed a $122m capital raising back in June, it is spending $US79.4m ($111.4 million) to buy a fleet of 14 Embraer E190 aircraft. The Embraer E190 is a narrow-body aircraft, built in Brazil, that is designed for regional routes. The type was once operated by Virgin Australia (ASX:VAH) before being retired in early 2018. The deal includes an option for another five Embraers and necessary equipment and training devices for the initial fleet. Deliveries will occur over an eight-month period beginning in September.   Managing director Scott McMillan labelled the spending spree a growth opportunity, saying the new Embraers will not replace Alliance’s existing Fokker 100 aircraft. Production of the Fokker 100s ceased in 1997, along with its parent company, forcing Alliance to find a new supplier. “With many airlines not flying and the increased demand for a 100-seat narrow body configured aircraft in the Australian market, this acquisition is more than opportunistic, it underpins our expected growth,” McMillan said. “Our Fokker fleet remains the core of our fleet and we believe will remain in service for many years to come, especially given our significant spare parts and inventory stores. “With limited Fokker aircraft acquisition opportunities, it was also the time to acquire a newer aircraft in order to position us for our next growth phase.”   Alliance shares began the year at $2.58 and now sit at $3.39, a 32 per cent gain.   In contrast, Alliance’s peers have experienced a horror 2020. Qantas (ASX:QAN) is down 55 per cent, as was Virgin Australia (ASX: VAH) before it entered administration in April.

Two UK coronavirus stocks,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Edward Sheldon, CFA | Monday, 3rd August, 2020 | More on: CCC RB While the coronavirus has devastated some industries, it has created enormous opportunities for others. Many companies in the technology and healthcare sectors, for example, have seen much higher demand for their services in the wake of the pandemic. In this article, I’m going to highlight two UK companies that are helping the world deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. I think these ‘coronavirus stocks’ have significant growth potential. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... One UK company that is certainly helping the world fight Covid-19 is Reckitt Benckiser (LSE: RB). It’s a leading health and hygiene company that owns a number of well-known, trusted disinfectant brands such as Dettol and Lysol. Reckitt’s sales are literally flying right now. For the first half of the year, sales in its Hygiene division were up 16.1% on a like-for-like basis. Meanwhile, total group revenue for the period was up 11.9%. Going forward, I expect sales growth to remain robust as I believe there will be an increased focus on hygiene globally. As the company said recently: “Covid-19 is likely to be with us for the foreseeable future and, as a society, we are embedding new hygiene practices to protect our way of life.” What I find particularly interesting is that professional opportunities are opening up with service providers such as hotels and airlines. These companies are looking to provide consumers with the highest standards of hygiene. Recently, Reckitt has created a new professional service and signed agreements with the likes of Hilton, Avis, and Delta Airlines to help keep their customers safe and protected. This coronavirus stock isn’t the cheapest stock around. Currently, RB shares trade on a forward-looking P/E ratio of about 24. I wouldn’t let that valuation put you off though. This is a high-quality company and the trend appears to be up. Barclays has it at a price target of 9,000p.

11,The Small-Cap Stocks on Managers' Buy Lists | Morningstar,". . The Small-Cap Stocks on Managers' Buy Lists. From budget airlines to bakers, smaller companies investment trust managers have","      Investor attention has been focused this year on large-cap companies like Amazon (AMZN) and AstraZeneca (AZN), whose shares have hit record highs. Despite the market and economic turmoil, small and medium-sized companies have also adapted their business models to the changed world. And many investment trust managers with a small-cap mandate have used this year’s market volatility to add to their portfolios. We take a look at what they’ve been buying. Less than two years’ old, Smithson Investment Trust was launched by Terry Smith’s Fundsmith as a vehicle to tap into small and medium-sized companies with a maximum market cap of £15 billion. In share price terms, the trust is up 46% since it launched in October 2018, and by 15% since the start of the year. In its latest half-year update, manager Simon Barnard revealed some new purchases within the 31-holding trust, including professional catering company Rational (RAA), whose self-cleaning industrial ovens are already in Buckingham Palace and the White House. The lockdown’s effect on the restaurant business has weighed on the German firm’s share price, which Barnard described as “an attractive opportunity to build a position in a company that we had admired for some time”. Another purchase for the trust this year was cyber security firm Qualys (QLYS), which had been on the manager’s radar before the pandemic. Qualys provides secure networks for companies across all of its devices, a business model that has proved its worth with the boom in home-working. Shares in US-listed Qualys are up 45% this year to $121 but trust manager Barnard thinks the company has many years of growth ahead, especially as cyber attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. The Standard Life trust, which has a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold and four-star rating, has been run by smaller companies expert Harry Nimmo for nearly 17 years. Automotive testing specialist AB Dynamics (ABDP) is a new addition to the trust. The company works with car makers to improve safety features and it is also developing technologies for self-driving cars. The investment potential of autonomous vehicles is a growing area of interest to many investors and artificial intelligence in particular is driving gains in this sector. AB Dynamics shares are off 17% year to date but are up seven-fold over five years.

Japan,"  MORE  Latest From Bloomberg  U.S. Envoy Abrams Sees New Iran Sanctions, Rules Out Military Action Notion of Iran Military Strike Is 'Garbage,' Says U.S. Envoy Abrams Trump Wins Battleground State of Texas   Aug 3, 2020  Shiho Takezawa and Tsuyoshi Inajima, Bloomberg News Japan Airlines Co. (JAL) aircraft stand at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday, April 23, 2020. Japan’s major airlines are on track to see revenue drop by 500 billion yen ($4.6 billion) from February through May, an industry group said, pushing ANA Holdings Inc.and Japan Airlines Co. closer to the crisis ensnaring other global carriers because of the coronavirus pandemic. , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Japan Airlines Co. posted its biggest quarterly net loss in at least eight years and decided to forgo paying an interim dividend as it contends with the devastating impact of the coronavirus. The carrier’s first-quarter loss was 93.7 billion yen ($89 million), the most since it re-listed on the Tokyo stock exchange in 2012 after emerging from bankruptcy. Since then, it only posted one other quarterly loss; in January-March of this year. The covid-19 outbreak has damaged the aviation industry globally and forced airlines into unprecedented cutbacks. The International Air Transport Association doesn’t expect a full recovery until at least 2024. While the Japanese government hasn’t called a lockdown and travel restrictions have been relatively lax, there’s been a resurgence in virus cases. JAL’s loss was worse than the 91.8 billion yen average forecast of two analysts, and the carrier warned it would take time for international demand to recover.
