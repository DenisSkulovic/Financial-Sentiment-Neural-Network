0,Why Shares of American Airlines Group Are Up Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of American Airlines Group Are Up Today. The airline successfully navigates labor and debt concerns.. What happened. So,"   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) gained altitude on Thursday after the U.S. airline reported third-quarter results that came in ahead of expectations. The airline has been hard hit by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX and ongoing labor woes but appears to be managing through the issues. American shares traded up more than 5% at the open before falling back somewhat. Before markets opened on Thursday, American Airlines reported third-quarter earnings of $1.42 per share on revenue of $11.9 billion, beating the consensus earnings expectation by $0.03 per share on revenues that were in line with forecasts. Chairman and CEO Doug Parker said in a statement that the airline is ""pleased"" with the report. ""However, we know that our results should have been better."" AMERICAN AIRLINES BOEING 737 IN FLIGHT. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. Specifically, Parker mentioned the impact of the continued grounding of the 737 MAX and ""operational challenges resulting from ongoing labor contract negotiations"" as factors eating into results. Without the 737 MAX, American has had to extend the flying lives of older, less-efficient planes, including two Boeing 767s and some Embraer E190s that were scheduled to be retired in 2019. That in turn is leading to higher costs. American reported third-quarter unit revenue up 2% but nonfuel unit costs up 4.8%, with profit negatively impacted by the 737 MAX by about $140 million. On the post-earnings call with investors Thursday morning, Parker said American Airlines would act to make sure it is Boeing shareholders, not American Airlines shareholders, who bear the brunt of the expense related to the 737 MAX grounding. American is also getting serious about paying down its industry-high debt burden, saying it expects adjusted debt to fall by upward of $4 billion over the next two years and by up to $10 billion over the next five years. That should help ease some of the biggest concerns lingering over American Airlines shares, as investors are loath to see an airline saddled with high debt heading into a potential economic slowdown.  AIRLINE DATA BY YCHARTS. Shares of American Airlines have been poor performers among major airline stocks so far in 2019, weighed down by the airline's numerous challenges.

1,Why Shares of Southwest Airlines Are Up Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Southwest Airlines Are Up Today. The discount king is navigating through the 737 MAX crisis well.. What,"   Shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) climbed more than 7% on Thursday morning after the discounter reported earnings that came in ahead of expectations. The airline is one of the U.S. carriers most affected by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX airplanes, but Southwest is showing it can fly through this turbulence. On Thursday morning, Southwest reported third-quarter earnings of $1.23 per share on revenue of $5.64 billion, beating analyst earnings expectations by $0.15 per share. The airline estimated the 737 MAX grounding reduced operating income by about $210 million, but Southwest was able to manage costs to help offset the reduction. A SOUTHWEST-BRANDED BOEING 737. IMAGE SOURCE: BOEING. Nonfuel unit costs increased by 7.6% in the quarter, better than Southwest's guidance for an 8% to 10% increase. At least some of that was tied to maintenance costs moving into the current quarter. Southwest said the ongoing 737 MAX issue would take its toll on fourth-quarter results. The airline said its fourth-quarter revenue per available seat mile, a key airline metric, would likely come in below expectations. That's because it is doing more flying at nonpeak times to handle demand despite not having the extra aircraft, but it is forced to discount those flights because they are at times that are less attractive to passengers. Southwest has taken the 737 MAX out of its schedule through February 2020, for now ignoring Boeing's commentary that it hopes to see the plane return to service before year's end. Southwest CEO Gary C. Kelly said in a statement accompanying the earnings release, ""we are engaged in ongoing discussions with [Boeing] regarding compensation for damages related to the MAX groundings."" Kelly went a step further during a morning appearance on CNBC, saying the famously all-Boeing airline would consider whether to diversify its fleet. On @CNBC, Southwest Air CEO Kelly says the board next year will consider whether to diversify away from Boeing aircraft. $LUV $BA  There is no way Southwest and its all-737 fleet could escape damage from the 737 MAX debacle, but the airline's third-quarter release showed it is managing through the crisis.

2,Analyzing Southwest Airlines' Market Share (LUV),Analyzing Southwest Airlines' Market Share (LUV). . KEY TAKEAWAYS. Market Share. The Business Model. Favorable Trends. Compete Risk Free with,"Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) has grown from a tiny airline with three planes serving three Texas cities in 1971 to one that serves almost 100 destinations across the U.S., flying 4,000 flights a day. The company's low-cost business model has been an example of consistency, booking 45 consecutive years of profitability through the end of 2018. Even more impressive considering the volatile and economically sensitive airline industry. Southwest has also garnered market share from competitors. There are many ways to measure market share. One could look at domestic revenue passenger miles, a measure of demand. Southwest Airlines had 18% of the domestic revenue passenger miles market share for July 2017 to June 2018. This falls just behind the market share leader, American Airlines (AAL) with 18.1%. Other larger competitors, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental (UAL), came in with market shares of 16.8% and 14.9%, respectively.  According to Southwest, its market share based on revenue passengers grew from 18% in 2006 to 24% in 2016. Also, according to its 2018 investor presentation, Southwest is the market share leader in half of the top 50 U.S. metro markets.  First and foremost, Southwest has a low operating cost structure. In fact, management states that unit costs are among the lowest in the industry. These are also referred to as cost per ASM (CASM) or operating expenses per ASM. After posting a CASM of 12.5 cents in 2014, the airline managed to shrink that to 11.48 cents last year. This allows the company to profit even as it offers low fares to its customers. The figure is also lower than its major competitors. For instance, operating expense per ASM was 15.15 cents for the first quarter of 2018 for American Airlines. At Delta Airlines, the figure was 15.07 cents for the fourth quarter of 2017. With United, its CASM for 2Q 2018 was 13.08 cents.  Southwest also provides point-to-point service rather than the hub-and-spoke that most major airlines offer. A hub-and-spoke system concentrates an airline's operations in major hub cities and serves other destinations through connecting services. Southwest's services are offered outside of this system, allowing the company to offer more direct nonstop flights. This also allows for low fares, since these airports typically have less air traffic, allowing Southwest to schedule more flights, minimizing downtime and employee productivity. Southwest is undertaking an effort to modernize its fleet.","Oct 23, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/021216/analyzing-southwest-airlines-market-share-luv.asp
3,SAVE | Spirit Airlines Stock Price,"Despite operational miscues and softening demand causing its profits to fall last quarter, Spirit Airlines had expected worse results.. .","Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) entered this year with high hopes, after ending 2018 with a stellar fourth-quarter performance. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) surged 11.4%, causing adjusted earnings per share to skyrocket 92% year over year. The budget airline's earnings momentum continued in the first half of 2019, as adjusted EPS jumped 63%. However, Spirit Airlines has been unable to keep unit revenue growing during the second half of the year in the face of tough comparisons. Even more troubling, operational miscues and other cost headwinds have caused a spike in nonfuel unit costs. As a result, Spirit's earnings fell last quarter and the company is on pace to post an even bigger EPS decline in the fourth quarter. Spirit Airlines' initial forecast for the third quarter was not encouraging. The company called for RASM to be roughly flat year over year (plus or minus 1%) and for adjusted nonfuel unit costs to surge 7% to 8%. A runway closure in Fort Lauderdale -- Spirit's biggest focus city -- and a surge in flight cancellations due to bad weather and overly aggressive scheduling were the main factors behind this projected rise in unit costs.

Is Copa Holdings still cheap?.","Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA), which is in the airlines business, and is based in Panama, saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Copa Holdings’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Copa Holdings Good news, investors! Copa Holdings is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $201.08, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Copa Holdings’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity. Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Copa Holdings. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? Since CPA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CPA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   An array of vegetables and fruits complement fall salads. As summer turns to fall, warm-weather salads featuring components like strawberries, orange slices and edible flowers give way to offerings with more seasonally appropriate ingredients, says Elyse Krawtz, a registered dietitian nutritionist with Northside Hospital in Atlanta. ""Fall salads can be beautiful with the rich colors characteristic of fall produce,"" Krawtz says. ""Fall is a good time to bring back root vegetables like beets, sweet potatoes and carrots."" Here are 15 ingredients for healthy fall salads: Apples Fall is apple-picking season, and it's also a great time to incorporate the fruit into a salad, says Patricia P. Araujo, a clinical dietitian with Northwestern Medicine Digestive Health Center in Chicago. Apple slices can complement a salad that's built on a bed of spinach with gouda, walnuts, cranberries and brie cheese, for example. The crispness of an apple provides a pleasant texture to a fall salad, without adding many calories. One medium-size apple has about 95 calories, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Apples also provide vitamin C, some B vitamins, minerals and fiber. ""I usually recommend (using) the whole apple versus the dried version,"" Araujo says. ""The dried fruit has less volume and is easier to over-consume. Also, some dried products have added sugars."" Beets Beets are a favorite for fall because they're in season and provide folate, vitamin C, carotenoids and vitamin A, says Anna Kippen, a registered dietitian nutritionist with Cleveland Clinic. Beets, a root vegetable, are also associated with decreased blood pressure and inflammation in the body. ""Not everyone realizes that they are edible, from their leafy greens all the way to the delicious, sweet root,"" Kippen says. Beets' leaves can be sauteed with herbs and spices for a savory topping, or roasted to add crunch on your salad. ""Try them on a bed of spring mix with slivered almonds, mandarin orange slices, feta, pine nuts and a balsamic vinaigrette,"" Kippen suggests. One of her favorite combinations is beets chopped with onions, bell peppers, black beans for protein, lemon juice and olive oil.

11,Australia's Qantas reports dip in domestic demand; shares slide | Reuters,Australia's Qantas reports dip in domestic demand; shares slide. . . . . . . . . . . .,"Discover Thomson Reuters More By Rushil Dutta, Jamie Freed 3 MIN READ (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd QAN.AX said on Thursday it would increase domestic capacity to maintain market share against rival Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd VAH.AX even as it reported lower revenue from those routes, sending shares tumbling almost 6%. Although revenue for the national carrier’s total business, which includes domestic and international operations, edged up 1.8% to a first-quarter record A$4.56 billion ($3.12 billion) in the three months that ended Sept. 30, unit revenue in its domestic business, which typically dominates profits, fell nearly 1%. “I think what’s really concerned investors is that fall in domestic revenue, largely driven by a drop-away in Jetstar,” Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said in reference to the airline’s budget brand, adding that rising fuel costs were also a concern. “Those two factors combined, along with the fact that Qantas was recently trading at an all-time high, appear to have hit the stock hard this morning,” he said. Margins at Australian airlines have been squeezed by fuel costs and weakness in consumer spending, as well as falling business confidence as economic growth in Australia falters. But the strategy of limiting capacity has benefited carriers. Qantas’ total capacity fell 0.2% during the quarter, with its international business clocking a 0.6% decline. Domestic capacity increased by 0.5%. The airline said it planned to further raise domestic capacity by up to 1% in the second half to match scheduling data that showed its rival would do the same despite market weakness. “The Qantas Group will maintain its strategic position in all parts of the market,” the airline said. Qantas has reported record profits since it abandoned a strategy of maintaining a 65% share of the domestic market, regardless of cost, in May 2014. Credit Suisse analysts last week told clients that forward schedules were showing a 2% increase in domestic capacity in the second half ending June 30, but noted that flights could be cut with six weeks’ notice. Financially strapped Virgin Australia is expected to complete a review of its route network and fleet by the end of December. In the international market, Qantas reported unit revenue up 4.4% in the first quarter as a weak Australian dollar made the market less attractive and competitors cut capacity more than anticipated. Qantas also flagged impact from unrest in the region, saying","Oct 23, 2019",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qantas-results-idUSKBN1X22PD

Our third quarter was impacted by the continued grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and the operational challenges resulting from ongoing labor contract negotiations. These challenges affected our customers, our shareholders and our team members, who we thank for their hard work and perseverance.” “We are taking decisive action to correct this performance and are excited about our prospects for 2020 and beyond.

Cargo revenue decreased 20% to $208 million due primarily to a 17% decrease in cargo ton miles. Other revenue was down 4% to $708 million. Third-quarter 2019 TRASM increased by 2% year over year to a record 15.71 cents on a 1% increase in total available seat miles, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of growth.

The fund dumped 150,000 Tesla shares stock earlier this week (worth $39 million), just days before a 20% spike in share price. All told, the firm would have made an extra $6 million if they’d held on until today’s opening bell.

They peg the revenue at Rs 7,905.3 crore, up 28 per cent, from a revenue of Rs 6,185.3 crore clocked in the corresponding quarter of the previous year (Q2FY19). Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher, however, expect a higher revenue at Rs 8,364.7 crore, up 35.2 per cent YoY, on the back of increased international operation. The low-cost carrier’s (LCC’s) international market share was at 21 per cent of the overall capacity as on July 31, government data show. The international expansion aids lower average fuel costs as aviation turbine fuel (ATF) on overseas routes is exempt from state VAT and central excise tax.  As for EBITDAR, analysts on an average estimate the metric to grow up to Rs 1,433.4 crore, up in the range of 994 per cent YoY to 1,190.2 per cent YoY, but fall 46 per cent sequentially.

They’re afraid they sell at the bottom. So, what would be the worst-case scenario if someone bought at the peak and then sold at the subsequent worst time? How can a covered call—perhaps the most boring of all options strategies—improve performance? “Worst-case scenarios,” below, shows the results of investing in the S&P 500 (SPY) via a popular exchange-traded fund, compared against buying SPY and selling a covered call $5 above the market. In nearly every year, the covered call significantly reduces the loss. That’s because the money received on the call helps reduce the losses. Right now, the call option in SPY that is roughly 30 days away will help reduce the downside by approximately 1.3%. Do that monthly to reduce downside risk. What are some covered call ideas?
