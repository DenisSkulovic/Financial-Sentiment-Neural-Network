0,Warren Buffett Just Taught Investors Another Big Lesson About Greed | The Motley Fool,Warren Buffett Just Taught Investors Another Big Lesson About Greed. By selling all of Berkshire Hathaway's airline stocks at a,"   In addition to being perhaps the most successful long-term investor in history, Warren Buffett has penned a host of memorable aphorisms in the course of writing dozens of annual Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) shareholder letters. One of his most famous sayings dates back to the 1986 shareholder letter, when Buffett wrote: ""Our goal is more modest: we simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful."" He reiterated the point in another shareholder letter nearly two decades later, saying that if investors feel compelled to try to time the market, ""they should try to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful."" Many value investors probably thought they were following Buffett's advice by buying airline stocks hand over fist as they plunged between February and April. On average, shares of the four largest U.S. airlines -- American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) -- have lost about two-thirds of their value since mid-February.  AIRLINE COVID-19 STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. If so, it must have been quite a shock to learn last Saturday that Buffett sold all of Berkshire Hathaway's substantial airline investments at a loss in recent months. (Moreover, he didn't make any major new stock acquisitions despite the market's big drop in March.) What gives? The first thing to note about Buffett's sage advice regarding greed and fear is that he was talking about the stock market: not individual stocks. In his 1986 letter, Buffett said that he bought bonds with Berkshire's insurance float rather than stocks -- despite thinking the bonds were mediocre investments -- because stocks had been driven to irrationally high levels. Buffett had to do something with the money, and bonds served as a relatively safe placeholder while other investors were being greedy with stocks. Buffett was even clearer in his 2004 letter. Just one paragraph before the quotation about greed and fear, Buffett opined that most investors' best strategy would be to buy and hold an index fund. He then advised investors that if they could not bring themselves to just buy and hold, they should try to be greedy when others were fearful. Presumably, he was still talking about buying an index fund -- not betting on individual stocks.

In early May, Berkshire Hathaway held its annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, only this year was a bit different as it all had to be done streaming on the Internet due to COVID-19 shelter-in-place and social distancing orders. That didn’t make it any less interesting. Berkshire’s Chairman, Warren Buffett, talked for nearly 4 hours. He also revealed a big portfolio move. Berkshire Hathaway had sold all of its airline stocks. It owned 4 airlines: American Airlines AAL, United Airlines UAL, Delta DAL and Southwest LUV. Buffett indicated that they sold for a loss but he decided to get out of the investment due to the length of time for a recovery in the airline industry from COVID-19. As he stated, “the world has changed.” Lessons to Learn from Buffett’s Forays in the Airlines Stocks 1.       Learn from past mistakes. Berkshire owned US Airways in the late 80s and early 90s and took a loss. Buffett hated the airlines for several decades, saying they never made money. Should he have listened to his gut over the last few years when he dove in again? 2.       Watch for changes in the underlying business. A company may no longer be the one you originally bought. Buffett indicated that it would take the airlines years to get back to where they were and he didn’t want to be an owner during that time. 3.       Admit your mistakes. Buffett admitted they had gotten caught in a bad investment. That’s why they moved immediately and he made the call to sell everything.

That’s why when United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock and the other major airline stocks took a nosedive due to novel coronavirus travel shutdowns, I bought shares. Source: travelview / Shutterstock.com At the time I was buying (March 23), I had no idea what Buffett was doing. But I knew Buffett loved airlines, and I remembered the things he’d said over the years. So when Buffett revealed last weekend that he had sold his UAL stock and all other airline stocks, I was somewhat confused. I believe that decision to dump airlines in the middle of a crisis is short-sighted. I also believe Buffett opted to cash out major airline losses rather than taking advantage of a long-term buying opportunity. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Through the years, Buffett has repeatedly described the type of investing opportunities he looks for. I’d like to go through a couple of these and apply them to the current situation with UAL stock. One of his most famous quotes has to do with timing the market. “We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful,” Buffett wrote in a 1986 shareholder letter. 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy Now Is the market fearful about UAL stock? It’s down 74% year-to-date, so I’d say yes. Hell, even Warren Buffett is apparently fearful about it. But while the “fearful” quote is one of Buffett’s most well-known, I prefer a different quote. “The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble … We want to buy them when they’re on the operating table,” Buffett once said. Is United Airlines a great company? That’s debatable. But I have one significant piece of evidence that it is. Warren Buffett, the greatest investor of all time, owned 9% of the company just a couple of months ago. So at least in Buffett’s opinion, United is a great company.

4,"With Clear Skies Years Away for Airlines, Sell LUV Stock | InvestorPlace","With Clear Skies Years Away for Airlines, Sell Southwest Airlines Stock. A potential rebound of LUV stock isn't worth the"," Is Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock a good “bottom-fishing” opportunity? That depends. Sure, it’s stronger than its rivals. But that may not be enough.   As it stands now, investor sentiment towards the airline space remains negative. Even Warren Buffett has sold his airline stocks, including Southwest. On the other hand, we could be seeing a “darkest before the dawn” moment right now. So should investors buy airlines stocks today, when pessimism towards the sector is elevated, and sell them at significantly higher price when things rebound? Set it and forget it, right? Not so fast! Bottom fishing with airline stocks is easier said than done. Since it’s a capital-intensive, cyclical industry, it’s easy for investors to lose their shirt with it, even in a mild recession. Today’s “perfect storm” of bad news for the airlines should give investors additional pause. I’m not saying airline stocks are headed to zero. Far from it. The  capital they raised recently should help keep them in the sky. But if you are looking for a stock that could double within a year, you better look elsewhere. Let’s dive in and see why Southwest remains a sell, even as it trades around its 52-week lows. As you know full well, air travel has dropped tremendously due to the pandemic. And Southwest Airlines is no exception. The airline says its revenue could fall as much as 95% year-over-year this month. As “shelter-in-place” orders expire, we could be reaching a bottom in terms of demand for air travel. Yet it remains to be seen whether the airline’s ticket sales will improve during the summer. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE Southwest needs enough capital to ride out the storm. The company has accomplished that goal. Late last month, the airline raised $4 billion by selling stock and convertible debt. That is on top of the $5.2 billion it raised earlier in 2020. Southwest’s funds should help minimize the risk facing LUV stock. Yet things could get worse as the company continues to burn cash. Sure, Southwest has managed to reduce its daily cash burn from as much as $65 million per day to about $30 million per day. By deferring the delivery of new planes and undertaking other cost-saving initiatives, Southwest has done the best it can to minimize its losses. But, since the possibility of a near-term air travel","May 8, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/05/clear-skies-year-away-sell-luv-stock/
5,Warren Buffett Sells Airlines: Is it Time to Bail on Air Canada (TSX:AC)? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Warren Buffett Sells Airlines: Is it Time to Bail on Air Canada,"      Ambrose O'Callaghan | May 9, 2020 | More on: AC Major sectors of the Canadian economy have been ravaged by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The airline industry has perhaps been hit the hardest. That is why investors were interested when Warren Buffett bet big on the industry earlier this year. International travel has essentially ground to a halt. Airliners have not faced a crisis that has so sharply impacted day-to-day operations since the aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001. The sector took roughly half a decade to recover from that tragedy, and it is impossible to calculate the long-term effects of the current crisis. Today I want to discuss Warren Buffett’s airline strategy and how investors should react in early May. Back in early March, I discussed Warren Buffett’s big bet on the airline sector. Buffett reportedly acquired Delta Air Lines shares for roughly $45.3 million. This grew his holding in the stock to over 70 million shares. Berkshire Hathaway also owned a significant stake in United Airlines, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. Warren Buffett ushered in a wave of pessimism in early May. The legendary investor said that he had sold off his large stakes in four airlines at a loss. Stocks of the U.S.-based airlines fell in response to Buffett’s statements. Buffett was a major player in the aftermath of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, scooping up blue-chip stocks at bargain prices and winning big over the past decade. His apparent lack of faith in the airline industry, at least in the near term, might inspire some investors to re-evaluate the industry right now. Late last month, I discussed why Air Canada (TSX:AC) had the ability to bounce back from this crisis. Meanwhile, Warren Buffett’s statements were not the only thing that brought down airline stocks to kick off the month of May. Air Canada’s own outlook was very pessimistic. On May 4, Air Canada reported a $1.05 billion loss in the first quarter of 2020. This was down from a $345 million profit in the prior year. In the earnings call, the company projected that the impacts of the pandemic would stretch for three years. It painted this as the “darkest period ever” for the commercial aviation industry. This gloomy outlook is something investors cannot ignore. “We expect that both the overall industry and our airline will be","May 9, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/05/09/warren-buffett-sells-airlines-is-it-time-to-bail-on-air-canada-tsxac/

U.S. Airlines have received $60 million as an aid due to the Economic Security(CARE) act signed by the American President Donald Trump. Warren Buffett, the billionaire owner of the Berkshire Hathaway company made a shocking decision of selling his four major shares from the U.S airline and made sure that he does not face issues as a shareholder of an airline that is grounded these days. Warren Buffett thinks that it is too risky to wait for positive business outlooks as the airline companies are already facing huge financial issues due to the fleets being grounded.

The easyJet share price,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Manika Premsingh | Saturday, 9th May, 2020 | More on: EZJ The last time I wrote about the FTSE 100 low-cost airline easyJet (LSE: EZJ) coincided with a sharp pickup in its share price. But the surge was short-lived. It has crashed 48% since (at the time of writing). So would I invest in it now? Yes, but with a caveat. I’ve said this before, but it bears mentioning again. This is one for the risk takers. There are both arguments in its favour and against EZJ. Whether we invest or not depends on how we weigh the risks against the potential rewards.   The one development in EZJ’s favour is its return to business. Arguably, near total shutdown is a death knell for any company if it continues for a prolonged period. But as the pandemic eases, there’s news of its business coming back on track, according to a Telegraph report. In fact, even Prime Minister Boris Johnson has mentioned that steps towards easing the lockdown will be announced soon. This is good news at any time. But when a company’s just availed itself of government support to keep chugging along, it’s great news! 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... I think EZJ’s past performance is also encouraging to me as an investor. It’s been a financially healthy company in the past. The Covid-19-driven lockdowns and the recession currently underway will both take their toll on its financial health, however. It follows that EZJ won’t be in the pink of health anytime soon. But as the recession begins to lift, I think better times can be expected for airlines, and EZJ is no exception. It will take a while, though. But I also understand investors’ hesitation in buying EZJ right now.

But as you’ve probably already read, Covid-19 has dealt our national carrier a devastating blow. With the imposed travel bans and reduced export activities, it’s no surprise that those in aviation are among the biggest casualties of this economic crisis… And shareholders who are still holding on for dear life to their SIA shares are left picking up the pieces.

Please practise your own discretion when making investment decisions.   Note: The figures are accurate at the time of writing (Apr 2020), but due to the nature of this industry, this information changes very frequently. For the latest updates, do check the SIA (C6L) SGX listing.              SIA was already struggling with uncertain growth prior to Covid-19. Facing stiff competition from budget airlines, SIA’s high operating costs, high debt and low profit margin (typical in the airline industry) also made it vulnerable to negative cash flow. From mid 2015 to mid 2018, share prices fluctuated in the $10 to $12 range, but from mid 2018 to just before the pandemic, they had fallen to $9+. Their performance had been slowing down since 2011, but they were still profitable until 2019. This year, however, the Covid-19 epidemic dealt SIA share prices a heavy blow. The airline has reduced their capacity by 96% and grounded almost all of its fleet. The lowest SIA share prices have gone so far is about $4.48. Their current dividend yield is 4.8%, but given the massive difficulties facing the airline, it’s unlikely they will be able to maintain this rate.

Analysts’ recommendations","UPDATED 8 MONTHS AGO Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ:SAVE) reported its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on Thursday. The company’s first-quarter revenue missed the estimates. The losses were also higher than expected. Management said that the first-quarter results included the negative impact of COVID-19 on its domestic and international operations. Spirit Airlines stock closed with a loss of 8.2% on Thursday. Today, the stock has fallen by 1.8% in pre-market trading. Spirit Airlines reported revenue of $771.08 million in the first quarter, which was lower than $855.8 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The revenue was lower than analysts’ estimate of $810.2 million. Meanwhile, the losses for the quarter were around $58.9 million or $0.86 per share compared to a profit of $57.5 million or $0.84 per share. Airlines’ load factor has declined since March when travel restrictions were imposed. Passenger demand and bookings declined drastically. The load factor measures the capacity utilization for an airline. The airline mentioned that it has taken steps to reduce costs. Spirit Airlines has reduced its capacity by around 75% in April and 95% for May and June. The company also reduced its discretionary capital spending by $50 million. Management said that the airline is in discussion with Airbus to defer some of its 2020 and 2021 aircraft deliveries and related pre-delivery payments. The company plans to save $185 million through deferred payments. Spirit Airlines also plans to reduce non-essential hiring. Spirit Airlines ended the first quarter with unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $894.4 million. The company also expects to receive approximately $335 million under the PSP program of the CARES Act. Regarding the cash burn rate, Spirit Airlines CFO Scott Haralson said, “We estimate our current average daily cash burn rate3 is about $4 million and we are evaluating initiatives to further reduce that amount should demand not begin to rebound in the coming months. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us, I am confident that together we will leverage our resources and tools to reinforce our balance sheet and put us in the best position to navigate the economic downturn and prepare for the recovery period.” The number of analysts covering Spirit Airlines stock and their recommendations remained unchanged after the earnings results.

With airlines firmly in the doldrums, the travel software","  It had been hoped that the new management team – led by chief executive Sean Corkery (pictured) and chief financial officer Niall O’Sullivan – would have been able to publish a set of audited accounts for 2019 before now. Photograph: Tom Honan  US billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has had a love-hate relationship with airline stocks over the years, told shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway vehicle last weekend that he has cleared out of the sector as companies in it fight for survival. “The world has changed for airlines,” he said. “I don’t know that three, four years from now people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year.” As Covid-19 rips through economies, few industries face more uncertainty about what the future holds than aviation. Tales of woe continue to mount. On Wednesday, Dublin-based jet lessor Avolon, which has 150 airline customers in 62 countries, said carriers accounting for 90 per cent of its rent roll had asked for some form of payment relief. With government bailouts the only game in town for many, Europe’s largest full-service airline Lufthansa is the latest to wave the white flag. It is currently in talks with German officials over a €9 billion rescue package as it loses almost €1 million an hour while most of its fleet remains idle. Meanwhile, some 4,500 staff at Aer Lingus, part of the International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) since 2015, face an unsettling wait as a union briefings on redundancies, initially scheduled for Friday, have been put off until next week. The speculation is that the company will seek to cull 900 jobs as 90 per cent of its aircraft are grounded and management predicts business next year will be 20 per cent below 2019 levels. It all couldn’t be happening at a worse time for Datalex, the Irish travel retail software provider to airlines, which was hoping that a grim 2019, dogged by an accounting scandal, would give way to a steadier 2020. Datalex issued a warning in early April saying it expected a “significant impact” on sales this year as the global aviation industry has ground to a virtual halt. “This is an unprecedented time for our industry, and it is difficult to accurately quantify the likely impact of Covid-19 on our financial and trading performance at this stage,” it said, adding that it was taking a red","May 8, 2020",https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/dermot-desmond-holds-the-datalex-cards-as-airlines-fight-for-survival-1.4248640
18,Boeing CEO: Could take 5 years for airlines to experience growth again | Fox Business,Boeing CEO: Could take 5 years for airlines to experience growth again. Boeing will prioritize paying down debt before it,"  Boeing President and CEO David Calhoun discusses aviation recovery amid coronavirus, its set back with 737 Max complications and supporting suppliers.

Boeing CEO David Calhoun said Friday it could take years for the aviation industry to return to normal traffic levels and resume growth, both of which have been decimated by the novel coronavirus pandemic. Major airlines have taken a huge hit due to a reduction in travel brought on by the outbreak of the virus, which forced travelers worldwide to observe stay-at-home orders and brought air traffic to a standstill. ""If I survey all of our customers and I start here in the U.S., and of course we do ... most are trying to dial in a return of about 30 [percent] to 50 percent by the end of this year,"" Calhoun said. ""A lot's going to depend on how the public responds to the safety of airline cabins, etc."" A Boeing 737 MAX airplane. (Photo: Associated Press) Calhoun added that unless a vaccine is developed soon and widely distributed, it will take about three years to ""slowly crawl back to the traffic levels"" the industry experienced in 2019. It will then take ""another two years to get back on the growth curve that the industry has enjoyed for almost two decades."" SOUTHWEST AIRLINES JTELINER HITS, KILLS MAN ON TEXAS AIRPORT RUNWAY He said Boeing will prioritize paying down debt before it considers returning money to shareholders. The Chicago-based aerospace giant announced in March it would suspend its dividend. ""Until we get back to the balance sheet we had before the virus and before the [737] Max, and then when we get to that level, we will reconsider and think about how we return money to shareholders and reestablish our dividend,"" he said. SENATORS URGE US AIRLINES TO ISSUE TICKET REFUNDS AFTER BAILOUT After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, airline traffic took nearly three years to recover after sliding 43 percent, and today's airline traffic could take just as long to recover from the novel coronavirus pandemic.
