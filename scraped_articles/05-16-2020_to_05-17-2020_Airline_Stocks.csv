0,Is It Safe to Buy Airline Stocks Right Now? | The Motley Fool,Is It Safe to Buy Airline Stocks Right Now?. A post-earnings buyer's guide to one of the sectors hardest hit,"   Airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, sending stocks crashing down and causing Warren Buffett to run for the emergency exits. Airlines today are trading at valuations that suggest they might not survive, and many prominent industry watchers are worried they might not. Boeing, which counts on the airlines for the bulk of its revenue, is expecting the worst. During a May 12 television interview, CEO David Calhoun said a ""major U.S. carrier"" will ""most likely"" go out of business this year, predicting an extended decline in travel. ""Something will happen when September comes around. Traffic levels will not be back to 100%, they won't even be back to 25%,"" Calhoun said. ""Maybe by the end of the year we approach 50%. So, there will definitely have to be adjustments that will have to be made by the airlines.""  AIRLINES YEAR TO DATE DATA BY YCHARTS. Calhoun may end up correct, though I don't think bankruptcy is a given. Still, it does seem likely that traffic will not return to pre-pandemic levels for years, and there is substantial risk to airlines. That risk is going to remain until we know more about how the pandemic is resolved and what the economy looks like when it is. I don't think the airline sector is un-investible right now, but I do think investors need to understand the risks and choose carefully between carriers. Here's a post-earnings look at the U.S. sector, broken down by the level of risk to investors buying in. The first thing to note is that if traffic simply does not return, either due to another wave of outbreaks, economic difficulties, changing consumer preferences, or some combination of all three, no airline is safe. There are very few businesses that can survive indefinitely with little revenue coming in, and certainly no airline that can. However, in anything other than the worst-case scenario, and even in Calhoun's slow recovery into the fall and 50% by year's end, there are airlines that look like they have the wherewithal to definitely survive. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) shares have only lost about half their value year to date, which makes the company a winner among airline stocks. The airline has long been an investor favorite due to its simple business structure and ability to make money when others can't -- Southwest famously has never resorted to layoffs, even","May 16, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/16/is-it-safe-to-buy-airline-stocks-right-now.aspx
1,Will COVID-19 Permanently Ground Airlines? | The Motley Fool,Will COVID-19 Permanently Ground Airlines?. We explore whether a travel industry hammered by the pandemic can take flight again.. Low,"   There are few sectors that have been hammered as hard as travel since the novel coronavirus pandemic began. Even the so-called ""travel leaders"" major airlines are teetering on the edge. Passengers are staying away in droves, flights are being canceled, and the few that are operating are mostly full — of empty seats. Air travel's bleakest time since 9/11 raises serious doubts for the industry and its investors. But for several reasons, I still don't think the COVID-19 crisis marks the end of air travel. In an interview on NBC's Today May 12, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dave Calhoun used words like ""grave"" and ""apocalyptic"" to describe the state of the airline industry. He even went as far as to say that a major U.S. airline would go out of business by the end of the year. Calhoun also warned that it could take from ""three to five years"" for the industry to recover to pre-pandemic growth rates.  At the end of March, Congress approved a $50 billion aid package to shore up the nation's airlines, part of its $2 trillion coronavirus pandemic relief plan. Half of that money — $25 billion — comes as grants to keep airline employee paychecks coming through Sept. 30. After that, Calhoun said, with airlines only operating at a 25% passenger load, and only climbing to around 50% of normal traffic by year's end (being optimistic), airline jobs will be lost, and the burden will permanently ground some carriers.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. So what does this mean for the investor? How does all this crack the once impermeable foundation of the American airline industry? What about globally? What would Warren Buffett do?  In early May, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" directed Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) to sell off all — that's right, all — of its shares in American (NASDAQ:AAL), United (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta (NYSE:DAL), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). Buffett owned between a 9% and 11% stake in these carriers, Berkshire's 2019 financials showed.  Buffett said ""the world has changed"" for U.S. airlines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and cast a bleak view on multiple media outlets. Airlines executives pushed back, like Delta in a statement, saying it was ""confident that the strengths that are core to Delta's business — our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability — will endure and position Delta to succeed"".","May 16, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/16/will-travel-leaders-make-their-connections-after-c.aspx
2,Forget airline stocks. Here are the 3 sectors of the FTSE 100 I’d be investing in now - The Motley Fool UK,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Forget airline stocks. Here,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Edward Sheldon, CFA | Saturday, 16th May, 2020 As a result of coronavirus disruption, some sectors of the FTSE 100 have been hit hard in 2020. Airlines are a good example. This year, British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines is down over 70%. Meanwhile, easyJet has fallen about 65%. From a contrarian perspective, airline stocks definitely look interesting. There’s certainly a chance these stocks could rebound. However, if you invest in airlines now, you’re taking on a fair bit of risk. What if travel doesn’t return to normal for years? Will these companies be able to survive in their current form? With so much uncertainty due to Covid-19, a near-term rebound is not guaranteed. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... In my view, investors are better off investing in sectors that are holding up well in the current environment and will continue to hold up well if economic conditions deteriorate further. With that in mind, here are my three preferred sectors of the FTSE 100 to invest in right now. The first sector I like in the current environment is healthcare. And not just because it’s leading the fight against Covid-19. What I like about healthcare is that it’s a defensive sector. People still buy medication and have operations when the economy is contracting. I also like the long-term growth story associated with the sector. The world’s ageing population, rising emerging market wealth, and the increasing prevalence of major health issues are dominant structural forces that should provide tailwinds in the years ahead. There are some excellent healthcare stocks in the FTSE 100. Smith & Nephew, GlaxoSmithKline, and Hikma are some of my favourites. I think these kinds of stocks offer a favourable risk/reward proposition at present. Another sector of the FTSE 100 I like right now is consumer goods. The reason I like consumer goods is that companies in this sector tend to be very resilient because they sell everyday products that people can’t do without.

3,Warren Buffett Makes It Clear: Stay Away From Airline Stocks,. . . . . . . . Warren Buffett Makes it Clear: Stay Away From Airline Stocks. Are airlines,"      Adam Othman | May 16, 2020 | More on: CHR Warren Buffett said, “The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.” Is this what he did with the airline stocks? At Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, Buffett admitted that he was wrong to invest in the airline industry. He had been against investing in the aviation industry for years. That changed in 2016 when he bought significant stakes in four major U.S. airlines. In 2016, things were different. Airlines seemed like mature and stable businesses, able to generate free cash flow from consistent operational activities. But the pandemic changed everything. People are afraid of flying, and the fear of getting sick because of a single individual taking a flight with you is unlikely to dissipate any time soon. Buffett let go of his stake in the airline industry at a steep loss. This makes us believe that he is cutting his losses, and he doesn’t believe that the industry is recovering anytime soon. Buffett is known for staying with good businesses, and if he believed that the airlines he had significant stakes in would make a full recovery and start making him money again, he might have waited. But his sell-off sends a clear message: Buffett doesn’t trust airlines as viable and profitable investments, at least not now. Maybe in a few years, when airlines start growing again, Berkshire Hathaway might make them a part of its portfolio again. This is something many investors, who are willing to risk their capital in pursuit of an abnormally low valuation, can learn from. Investors can learn that when you don’t believe in a business’s recovery, it’s okay to admit that you were wrong and cut your losses as much as you can by moving swiftly. It also means keeping an eye on your investments and the underlying companies and make sure that they still hold to the values that made you invest in them in the first place. If you want to emulate Buffett’s aversion to the airline stocks, you may want to stay clear from Chorus Aviation (TSX:CHR.B) as well. As a stock, it didn’t even come close to Air Canada in the last five years. Despite being a dividend stock, it could never attract investors like Air Canada did with its amazing growth.

he airline industry has been in a slump the world over since the commencement of lock-downs across the globe and the spread of the unique coronavirus. Lately, there has also been much news about Warren Buffet selling his stakes in various airlines. Contrary to his actions, value investors are encouraging many to hold onto airline stocks, especially those with a long investment horizon and an appetite for risk. The barrage of news piqued my interest and I decided to run some of my own tests to validate the news which I was seeing and hearing. In order to better understand (on a personal level) and intertwine the airline industry with the performance of Air Canada, I looked at aircraft movements in Canada, used an LSTM model to predict the future stock prices of Air Canada and eventually used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method to arrive at the intrinsic share value. I collected data from Stat Canada about aircraft movement from January 2015 (major airports) up to April 2020 and compiled it. Subsequently, I created an index linked to the aircraft movements in July 2018 as it was the highest number — this would allow me to gauge the level of aircraft movements in the future with those in a bullish market. First, I created a monthly average for all the twelve months in a year and used that to create a seasonality index for every month (i.e. Monthly Average of a Month / Average of all Months). I then calculated the average aircraft moments for every month and (index values) and check the difference of those values with those of ‘covid’ the affected months of Jan — May 2020. The index value of April 2020 was 10 which correlates with reports of airline cutting between 85–90% of their capacity for the covid affected months. Further, I assumed that the effects of covid and the international travel restrictions and lock-downs will commence to open up — at least for businesses and other important drivers of economy by end June 2020. I graduated the index difference downward by 2.5 points to cater to conservative growth estimates considering that aircraft will have to undergo maintenance checks and pilots will have to regain their ‘currency’ before being pressed into service. My intention was to forecast the values up to the completion of a stabilized cycle of business as this would indicate the normalization","May 17, 2020",https://towardsdatascience.com/airline-industry-and-air-canada-stock-prediction-using-deep-learning-c92da3908a3b
7,AAL Stock: Things Could Get Worse For American Airlines | InvestorPlace,"Things Could Get Worse For American Airlines. With the potential to fall further in the near term, skip the legacy"," Have we seen a bottom in airline stocks? That’s debatable. On one hand, major names like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock have fallen about 70% since February. Even if things don’t completely “return to normal” after the novel coronavirus, shares could move significantly higher on an industry rebound. On the other hand, big-time investors like Warren Buffett sold off their airline positions. Some have seen this as a sign that the airline industry’s prospects are getting worse, not better. And now, with Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dave Calhoun saying there could be an airline bankruptcy in 2020, there’s plenty of reason for investors to be fearful of legacy carriers like American right now. The question is, will this airline be the one that goes bust? In prior analysis, I discussed how downside may be limited if shares fall down to single-digits. Yet, now I’m more skeptical of the carrier’s prospects in the coming year. Among the legacy carriers, it’s easy to see this one in particular having to file for Chapter 11. So, what does this mean for investors looking at the stock today? Simply put, there’s plenty more downside from here. Granted, things could turn on a dime. Air travel rebounds quicker than anticipated, sending AAL stock significantly higher than it is right now. But chances are, investors will get more fearful, not less fearful, in the near-term. How likely is it that American Airlines files for Chapter 11? Compared to major carriers, this airline seems the most likely to go bust. Legacy carriers like Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), as well as major low-cost names like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) are regarded as having the best balance sheets in the space. American? Not so much. This may explain why the airline’s bonds are the costliest to insure. And looking at its balance sheet, that’s no mystery. As this Seeking Alpha contributor recently discussed, the company could have as much as $40 billion in debt by the end of the year. Burning around $6 billion in cash this quarter, the airline is being kept afloat with the funds provided by the $2 trillion CARES stimulus bill. Without further government assistance, chances are AAL will need to file for Chapter 11. Another bailout would help prevent AAL stock from heading to zero. But, even then, it’s tough to see shares moving higher from where they trade today. With the first bailout seen as too","May 17, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/05/things-could-get-worse-avoid-aal-stock/

For sectors such as airlines, the outlook during the coronavirus"," Stocks have bounced off their March lows but remain stuck in a relatively narrow trading range while investors grapple with an unprecedented lack of visibility on the economic outlook. Even those interested in jumping back into the stock market to hunt for bargains face a tall order: How can you value stocks when it remains unclear how quickly the economy will bounce back and whether consumer behavior will change when it does? The nearly completed earnings season offered little clarity because many companies were unable to forecast what the future holds. For some of the most-beaten-down stocks, including those of airlines, the outlook is particularly murky. The carriers have lost billions of dollars since the coronavirus pandemic brought travel to a near halt in mid-March. And even once they resume a busier schedule, many Americans may be reluctant to travel. “2020 earnings are completely out the window,” said Dan Eye, head of asset allocation and equity research at Roof Advisory Group, a division of Fort Pitt Capital Group. “I think this year is really all about survival.” That means investors can’t rely on a traditional playbook. Past earnings don’t matter, revenue has plummeted, and there is no indication when demand will pick up.

13,Coronavirus Is Causing Airfares to Rise  | Barron's,Coronavirus Is Causing Airfares to Rise. ,"  The travel industry has been decimated by Covid-19. People aren’t flying or cruising the high seas. Now cruise operators are offering deals in an attempt to get people to get back on boats. Consumers shouldn’t expect the same from airlines. Airfares, in fact, are rising. It’s counterintuitive, but the cost of a flight was up in April and May. The reason is fairly simple: supply and demand. Far fewer people are flying. That’s the demand side of the equation. But most of the world’s commercial jet fleet is parked, so while demand has cratered, so has the supply of airline seats. Cowen analyst Helane Becker publishes a weekly fare tracker for her clients. The latest couple of reports illustrate the trend. “We track 278 domestic routes across 4 fare products for American, Delta and United, ” wrote Becker in her most recent update, which covers fares through May 11. “Total fares are up 12.29%.” The comparison is with the same week in 2019. In previous updates, which covered fares through April 13 and May 4, Becker found ticket prices rose 13.7% and 10.9% year over year, respectively. She did point out, however, that with demand down more than 90%, fare trends are erratic. Volatility aside, rising fares in April and May may surprise a lot of people. The results are even stranger considering there is another factor that should be reducing prices: The cost of jet fuel is down. Benchmark crude oil prices have fallen 55% year to date, and jet fuel is refined from crude oil. Falling oil should result in lower airline operating costs and, in turn, lower fares. But that isn’t happening right now. Travelers who want a deal can look for a cruise. They appear to be a more affordable option. Carnival (ticker: CCL), for instance, is offering five-day cruises in September 2020 for about $108, plus taxes and fees. That’s pretty cheap. The sale goes through May 20 if investors, or anyone else, feels like they need to get away. Cruise operators are starting to plan for a post-Covid world. People may have to fly to ports, but right now there aren’t a lot of places to go. That’s another reason airfares aren’t cheaper. “There is no incentive to lower them to stimulate demand,” Becker told Barron’s in an email. “As long as major tourist attractions are closed and people are still under","May 16, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airfare-bargains-coronavirus-cruises-cheap-51589549611

CNBC Newsletters,"Unprecedented demand for stocks. That’s one major piece to the puzzle that is the current relationship between the U.S. stock market and the underlying economy, O’Shares ETFs Chairman and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” this week. “Institutional demand for equities is unprecedented given there’s very few choices,” O’Leary said in a Monday interview. “Your fixed-income option of government bonds in the U.S. used to be something you’d ... consider. That’s no longer an option.” With U.S. interest rates near historic lows, investors have been forced to seek income elsewhere, O’Leary said, adding that as a result, large, relatively stable companies with dividend yields of 2.5-3.5% are becoming increasingly good bets. “That’s a very attractive place to park money for the next 24 months, and you’re seeing a tremendous demand for it across the board,” he said. “It’s not the retail investor that’s driving this market. It’s institutional. I speak to them every day. And they’re saying, ‘What other choice do I have if my bogey over the next 12 months is 6%?’ There is no other choice.” “Bogey” is financial jargon for the performance of a given benchmark, such as an equity index. O’Leary added that he wouldn’t be surprised to see a coronavirus treatment or vaccine in as little as 18-24 months given recent advances in medical science. Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, said the recent market action suggests that investors are becoming “more selective.” “You saw $15 billion of inflows into sector ETFs in April, with basically health care and tech, so XLV [and] XLK, ... having the most flows on record in a given month because investors were indiscriminately picking out areas of the market that would perform best during a period of sluggish earnings growth [and] economic growth where those firms’ products and services are likely to be sought after,” Bartolini said in the same “ETF Edge” interview. The XLV and XLK are SPDR’s S&P 500 sector ETFs tracking health care and technology stocks, respectively. The XLV is down about 2% year to date and the XLK is up just over 1%. The S&P has declined almost 12% in that time. Recent inflows into beleaguered funds such as the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) could also signal a spike in investor appetite for equities, Bartolini said. “In","May 16, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/kevin-oleary-talks-stock-market-etfs-as-economic-worries-mount.html

News Tips. CNBC,"Wall Street logged its best day in over a month on Monday as news from a Moderna trial stoked optimism about a potential coronavirus vaccine.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 911.95 points higher, or 3.9%, at 24,597.37. The S&P 500 gained 3.2% to close at 2,953.91 while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.4% to 9,234.83. The Dow and S&P 500 both had their biggest one-day gains since April 6 while the Nasdaq posted its best rally since April 29. The S&P 500 also closed at its highest level since March 6. Moderna shares rallied 20% after the company reported “positive” phase one results for a potential coronavirus vaccine. The company said that after two doses all 45 trial participants had developed coronavirus antibodies.   “This information coming out of Moderna takes a little bit of the unknown out of the market,” said Christian Fromhertz, CEO of The Tribeca Trade Group. “So there’s a knee-jerk reaction that’s going on with all those names that have been under pressure.” Fromhertz referred to those stocks as “have-nots.” “I think that’s just how it’s going to work,” said Fromhertz. “The closer they get to reopening the country, the more this is going to be beneficial for the ‘have-nots’ and there’s going to be more profit taking in some of the ‘haves.’” Disney closed 7.15% higher while MGM Resorts rallied 10.5%. Cruise operator Carnival gained 15.2%. Delta and United Airlines both rose more than 13%. Netflix — a stock that has benefited from people staying at home — closed 0.3% lower.  Bank stocks rose broadly. Wells Fargo jumped more than 8% while Bank of America and Citigroup both closed over 6% higher. JPMorgan Chase advanced 5.3%. Comments from the Federal Reserve chief also added to the bullish sentiment.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said to CBS’ “60 Minutes” that “there’s a lot more we can do” to help the economy. “We’ve done what we can as we go. But I will say that we’re not out of ammunition by a long shot. No, there’s really no limit to what we can do with these lending programs that we have.” The central bank leader also said he’s “highly confident” the U.S. economy will claw its way back from the current pullback, but warned that it may not fully recover until a Covid-19 vaccine is complete.
