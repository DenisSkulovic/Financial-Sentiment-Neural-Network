2,How to Invest in Cruise Line Stocks | The Motley Fool,How to Invest in Cruise Line Stocks. Everything you need to know about stocks from the biggest cruise lines and,"   If you're interested in gaining exposure to the global vacation industry but want to venture beyond the traditional hotel, airline, and travel booking giants, then cruise line stocks might be just what you're looking for. Cruises enjoy the same benefits from positive long-term trends shaping the wider luxury travel industry, including economic growth and rising incomes, but cruise ships aren't as susceptible to competition from smaller rivals and the industry economics are more favorable than in the airline space. But there are a few factors investors should know about the cruise ship business before they begin buying stocks in the sector. Below, we'll take a comprehensive look at the industry, the biggest cruise line operators, and the metrics that matter most to a cruising business. Arming yourself with everything you need to make smart decisions about riding the cruise line wave will help you grow your money and diversify your portfolio. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Cruise lines are part of the travel and vacation industry, which means they compete with each other, and also with land-based hotels and resorts. The broader global addressable market is massive, with estimates pegging total travel spending at over $1.6 trillion in 2018. The cruise industry only covers a small subset of that huge annual spending pie, but it has several characteristics that support unusually strong and profitable growth, including high customer satisfaction. Cruise guests typically rate their vacation experiences more positively compared to land-based hotel trips. Some of the benefits that cruisers cite are stress-free travel to several destinations without needing to pack and unpack and the peace of mind that comes with all-inclusive bookings that cover food, lodging, and entertainment.  There are many tiers of cruising options, ranging from value to premium to ultra luxury, but the industry's most popular trip categories tend to cater to a wide range of demographics and income levels. Ships are packed with onboard entertainment for kids and for adults, food choices that span from pizza by the pool to premium restaurant table service, and cabin offerings ranging from sparse, windowless rooms to expansive suites with wraparound decks. On average, a seven-night cruise costs around $1,500 per person, including the ticket fare and all the onboard extras. But the total bill can reach many multiples of that price if you opt for the bigger stateroom, nicer amenities, and the more luxurious ships in the","Aug 2, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-cruise-line-stocks.aspx

While single-minded focus on investing is great, single-minded focus on one investment is not. Diversifying your portfolio and smart asset allocation is the way forward to steadily building long-term wealth. Imagine if you invested your entire life-savings into an airline stock expecting a boom in air travel to drive your investment. However, safety concerns with the airline’s planes grounds the entire fleet indefinitely and all flights are cancelled. The probability is the share prices of the airline’s stock will drop and your portfolio would experience a decline in value. If, however, you had spread your investments to include other transportation-related stocks like shipping, rail or toll way operators, only part of your investment portfolio would be affected. There is also a possibility that other transportation-related stock prices would rise as people turn to alternative forms of transportation. You could also go a step further and spread your investments beyond transportation-related stocks, and invest in companies from different types of industries. Remember the age-old advice: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket? It is sage advice for investors. Diversification ensures that by putting your eggs in different baskets, you will not be creating an unwanted risk to your capital by being too heavily weighted in one specific sector or with a particular company being slanted one way or another1

7,Investors Who Bought Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) Shares Five Years Ago Are Now Down 36% - Simply Wall St News,Investors Who Bought Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) Shares Five Years Ago Are Now Down 36%. A Different Perspective. Discounted cash flow,"For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE), since the last five years saw the share price fall 36%. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 19% in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report. Check out our latest analysis for Spirit Airlines While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Spirit Airlines actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 13% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS. Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement. In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 13% a year in the five year period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.  Spirit Airlines is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Spirit Airlines in this interactive graph of future profit estimates. Investors in Spirit Airlines had a tough year, with a total loss of 0.5%, against a market gain of about 4.8%.

8,The Best Time to Buy First-Class Airline Tickets,The Best Time to Buy First-Class Airline Tickets. Tips for saving money when flying first class. KEY TAKEAWAYS. Know When,"Every now and then you need first-class airline tickets. Maybe you’re off on a business trip and the boss is footing the bill—or you need extra comfort for an older relative’s flight. Or perhaps you're celebrating a special occasion and flying first class will make it even more special. Whatever the reason for flying first class, you know you’ll pay—and pay big—for the superior service, free food, and roomy seats in first class. Quick example: A round trip on American Airlines from New York City to Los Angeles in May (Thursday to Thursday) costs about $480 for an economy seat, but the same flight in first class is $2,130. If that sounds wild, a first-class seat on one of the most luxurious commercial airlines, Emirates, from New York to Dubai is just a hair under $26,000. Maybe you're going to go ahead and indulge, but why overpay? These ideas will help keep costs down. My research included pricing domestic fares on the three U.S. airlines with significant first-class cabin presence (American, Delta, and United) on week-long itineraries, though the length of a trip is not necessarily relevant to pricing. Book at least seven days in advance. Some experts say for even cheaper flights, book at least three weeks before the departure date. Many business travelers with last-minute trips can’t do this, obviously, and airlines love this because itineraries booked inside the seven-days-before-departure window can add an up-to-40% premium to the fare. If you can give yourself at least a week’s head-start in the booking process, you can reap significant savings. Midweek and Saturdays on some airlines are the best times to fly. Both American and Delta had slightly lower first-class domestic fares for Wednesday and Saturday travel, and American also showed cheaper first-class fares on Tuesdays. United’s first-class fare differential was non-specific as to travel days. Days to avoid: The most expensive days to fly on both American and Delta are Sunday and Friday, and Monday is also an expensive day on Delta. Again, United’s first-class pricing was non-specific to days. Fly more expensive days and you could pay up to 10% more on American and up to 20% more on Delta. Bottom line: Compare airfare prices even when shopping for the most expensive tickets. This sounds counterintuitive but some airlines actually offer first-class seats at a discount during the coach booking process, which can be many times cheaper than","Aug 2, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/wealth-management/041316/best-time-buy-first-class-airline-tickets.asp
9,Tempted by the IAG share price and 7% yield? Here's what you need to know - The Motley Fool UK,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Tempted by the IAG,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Roland Head | Friday, 2nd August, 2019 | More on: IAG NWG Taking a contrarian stance when investing can sometimes deliver big profits. But not all cheap stocks are bargains. Sometimes the market has spotted problems on the horizon and is pricing the stock accordingly. Here, I’m going to look at two FTSE 100 stocks which look cheap and boast 7% dividend yields. Is now the time to buy? British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE: IAG) is facing rising fuel costs and tough competition on short haul routes. But the group’s long-haul operations are performing better. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Although the IAG share price has fallen by more than 35% over the last year, the group’s profits don’t yet reflect such a downbeat outlook. On Friday the company reported an operating profit of €1,095m for the first half of the year, just 2% lower than for the same period last year. The problem with investing in airlines is that they have very high fixed costs. This can leave them facing big losses during economic downturns, when demand tends to fall. To run several large airlines like IAG, you need hundreds of planes, thousands of staff, and lots of expensive landing slots. If demand falls, these costs still have to be met, even though ticket revenues will slump. To get an idea of what could happen, I’ve taken IAG’s results from the last 12 months and modelled a 10% drop in revenue and a 5% fall in costs. The result was operating profit for the 12-month period fell by nearly 50%, from €3,038m to just €1,622m. This experiment suggests to me the group’s 10% operating margin could be quite fragile if market conditions worsen. I think this is why IAG shares are currently trading on just four times 2019 forecast earnings. Although I’m tempted by its forecast dividend yield of 7%, I wouldn’t buy these shares at the moment. One unloved stock I already","Aug 2, 2019",https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2019/08/02/tempted-by-the-iag-share-price-and-7-yield-heres-what-you-need-to-know/
10,Value stocks may be in for a renaissance with investors - The Washington Post,Value stocks may be in for a renaissance with investors. . Today’s Headlines. USPS ‘gridlocked’ as historic crush of holiday,"An information-driven revolution has changed stock investing over the past several decades. Huge quantities of data are instantly available to anyone with an Internet connection, diminishing professional investors’ competitive edge. Companies and industries are more transparent. Consumer trends are easier to spot, thanks to social media. Global news affecting the markets is available 24/7. Believe me, I know. Before I go to sleep, I check out the Asian markets and business news so I am ready for the next day. Such advances have made it much, much harder to be the first to identify the ignored, hidden or misunderstood opportunities known as “value stocks,” which could return many times your investment. We are talking about the kinds of companies that Warren Buffett spotted about 50 years ago and that became the foundation of his $85 billion fortune — the big ones (Coca-Cola, Geico) and the small ones (Blue Chip Stamps, See’s Candies). This investment guarantees monthly checks for the rest of your life. But there’s a downside. It wasn’t easy to find the potential behind these companies when Buffett was starting out. It’s more challenging now to find them ahead of the market, though the math geniuses, data dweebs and other assorted rocket scientists at hedge funds, private equity firms and asset management companies keep trying. “As far as value stocks go, the market has gotten steadily more efficient over the past five decades,” said David Poppe, former chief executive of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, a 50-year-old investment firm that built its reputation on finding value stocks. Co-founder Bill Ruane was a close friend and colleague of Buffett’s, and the billionaire’s Berkshire Hathaway remains one of Ruane, Cunniff’s biggest holdings. I have known Poppe, a journalist turned investor, for a few years and regularly attend the annual meeting of Ruane, Cunniff’s flagship Sequoia Fund. I have had a modest investment in Sequoia for more than two decades. Poppe is no longer with the firm. I asked Poppe about the thesis of some investors that a value stock renaissance is coming after years of seeing prices lag behind the growth shares spearheaded by FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google).

12,Alert! This TSX Stock Can Be Canada’s Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Alert! This TSX Stock Can Be Canada’s Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND). Two New,"      Ambrose O'Callaghan | August 2, 2019 | More on: BYND MFI Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) has been a massive success story since its initial public offering (IPO) in May. In late July, the stock had extended its gains to over 700%. It is not just the stock that is inspiring confidence. Beyond Meat’s products are hitting menus across North America, and they are also filling shelves at supermarkets. After its IPO, I’d discussed its potential and the popularity of plant-based meat alternatives. Consumers have grown more health-conscious over the past decade, and this is drawing many away from meat products. There has been a significant increase in U.S. and Canadian citizens identifying as vegans and vegetarians in recent years. Beyond Meat boasts that it offers the taste of traditional meat products with the health benefits of a plant-based diet. The California-based company is drawing eyeballs, but it is not the only player in this high-growth space. In fact, right here at home, a Canadian staple started to pivot to plant-based proteins in 2017. In February 2017, Maple Leaf Foods (TSX:MFI) announced that it would acquire Lightlife Foods, a leading manufacturer of plant-based protein foods. This strategic push into this growing market was one of the reasons I’d remained bullish on Maple Leaf even in a turbulent 2018. Shares of Maple Leaf shot up 12% on August 1. The company released its second-quarter 2019 results on the same day. Maple Leaf achieved double-digit growth in its plant-based protein sales, which fuelled 12.5% sales growth in the quarter. However, the company still recorded a net loss of $6.3 million, or $0.05 per share, due to fair-value changes on balance sheet items that totaled $60.7 million. Maple Leaf announced that it would seek an aggressive growth strategy in the plant-based proteins space, which should come as no surprise in this current environment. The Lightlife Burger is directly competing with the Beyond Burger at Canadian grocery stores and restaurants. Investors should take interest in how Maple Leaf goes about marketing itself against Beyond Meat going forward, as it appears to have a distinct disadvantage in that arena right now. Mordor Intelligence, a global market research and consulting firm, recently forecast that the global plant-based protein market would grow to $9.5 billion by 2024. This would represent a CAGR of 7% over the projection period (2019-2024).

USD/JPY.,"                                                   With tech stocks fetching rich valuations, there is little room for error. Just look at shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). On news of its recent earnings report, AMD stock plunged 10%. It’s true that the AMD share price is still up a sizzling 65% for the year, making it one of the top performers among tech stocks. Yet the drop still shows that the company has its issues. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips So, let’s take a look at the quarter. Net income went from $116 million, or 11 cents a share to $35 million, or 3 cents a share. This haul beat Wall Street’s expectations by 3 cents a share. On the top line, revenues fell from $1.76 billion to $1.53 billion. Yet the consensus was calling for $1.52 billion. But of course, the real problem for AMD stock was the guidance. For the current quarter, the company’s revenue forecast is for $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion. This compares poorly to Wall Street’s more robust $1.94 billion. One of the reasons for the deceleration is the disruption from the U.S.-China trade war. Also, competitive pressures from rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have taken the shine off the AMD share price. 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 Yet perhaps the biggest problem for AMD stock is the gaming market. It looks like sales are trailing off as customers are waiting for new consoles from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony (NYSE:SNE). Keep in mind that the impact from this has overshadowed the growth in AMD’s EPYC and Radeon chip revenues. Despite all this, it’s important to note that AMD continues to push innovation. In the quarter, the company launched high-performance CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units) as well as scaled 7-nanometer processors for PCs, gaming and data centers. Here are some other notable events for the quarter: The company entered a multi-year strategic agreement with Samsung, which will license AMD’s graphics technology for mobile applications and smartphones. AMD announced its X570 chipset for providing the first-ever PCIe 4.0 ready platform for consumers.

DGCA Press Trust of India  |  New Delhi 
Last Updated at August 2, 2019 22:48 IST With situation appearing turbulent in Kashmir, aviation regulator DGCA advised airlines on Friday to remain ready to operate additional flights from the Srinagar airport if the need arises, according to a source. The advisory came hours after the Indian Army, citing intelligence inputs, said Pakistan-based terrorists were planning to target the ongoing Amarnath Yatra. The Army's disclosure prompted the Jammu and Kashmir administration to ask the yatris and tourists to ""curtail"" their stay in the Valley and leave immediately. ""DGCA has advised airlines to remain ready. If there is a need, airlines should be ready to run extra flights,"" a source privy to the development told PTI. ""Around 8.45pm, the situation at the Srinagar airport was checked by the DGCA and it was found to be normal. It was found that there is no need to run extra flights right now. But if the need arises later on, the airlines have been advised to remain ready to run extra flights,"" the source added. On Friday evening, IndiGo said on Twitter, ""In view of the current security situation in Srinagar and the Government advisory regarding it, we are providing a full fee waiver on rescheduling/cancellation for all flights to/from Srinagar till Aug 09, 2019."" With around 49 per cent share in the domestic air-passenger market, IndiGo is the leading airline in the country. Vistara tweeted, ""Due to prevailing security situation in Kashmir, we are waiving change and cancellation fees for flights to/from Jammu and Kashmir for next seven days (till August 9, 2019). Only fare difference, if any, will be applicable for date changes."" Meanwhile, ANI tweeted that Air India too has decided to give a full fee waiver on rescheduling/cancellation for all its flights to and from Srinagar, J&K, till August 15.

With the stock market at its second most expensive valuation ever, and under some heavy selling pressure this week, it is a good idea for investors to know how to hedge their portfolios against a correction or a crash. John V. Lintner is a famous economics professor who studied the use of commodities futures to reduce risk in stock and bond portfolios. He was hoping to save investors money over both the long-term and blunt crash scenarios. He said that the best defense against a stock market downturn is to modify a long-term diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds with non-correlated investments – investments that do not move in lock-step with the overall market.   His study found that this approach would create much less risk at each possible expected return level than a portfolio of stocks and bonds on their own. Today, just about all categories of stocks and bonds correlate highly to the overall market. Therefore, you first must diversify very broadly as a first step and beyond just the stock market. That means owning growth and value equities, individual corporate bonds, all size equities including micro-cap, small, large, and medium-capitalization stocks, real estate, REITs, muni bonds, preferred stocks, commodities, managed futures, exchange-traded debt, CEFs, BDC, alternative investments, and options. Yet even all this won’t be enough because the stock markets have become increasingly correlated with each other, and the Fed cutting rates won’t keep equities up","Aug 2, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-market-crash-is-coming/

Between the growth of airline travel and airline mergers, the industry’s top players have become huge enterprises. But which airlines are the world’s largest? Let’s see how the world’s largest airlines stack up. One of the most widely-used measures of airline size — published each year by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) — is revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs.) As the name suggests, this metric is the sum of the distances flown by each of the airline’s paying passengers over the course of the year. Here are the airlines that flew the most passengers the farthest in 2018: Thanks to its global network and its leading position in the massive US air travel market since its merger with US Airways, American Airlines carried the most paying passengers farther than any other airline in the world. However, Delta and United are close behind. After edging out United in 2015, Delta was again the second-largest airline in the world by passenger-kilometers in 2018 with 4.3% growth over 2017. Only half a billion RPKs behind American, Delta could well pass American in 2019, especially in light of American’s quarrels with its mechanics union and the grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft for most of the year. United Airlines once again was third among the world’s airlines by RPKs in 2018. Even if Delta passes American in 2019, it is neck and neck with United. Data for 2018 from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics showed United passing Delta in scheduled revenue passenger-miles, though the IATA data shows Delta still ahead of United by around half a billion RPKs. With United also affected by the 737 MAX grounding in 2019, Delta may come out on top. With its all-wide-body fleet and extensive worldwide network consisting largely of long-haul flights from its hub in Dubai, Emirates flew the fourth-most passenger-kilometers of any airline in the world in 2018 — and the most of any airline based outside of the United States. Southwest makes up for what it lacks in distance in pure volume. Despite operating only Boeing 737","Aug 3, 2019",https://thepointsguy.com/guide/worlds-largest-airlines/
