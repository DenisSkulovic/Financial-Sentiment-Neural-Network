CNBC Newsletters","With the S&P 500 about one percent from its all-time highs, Wall Street bull Edward Yardeni is predicts a record breakout is coming. The Yardeni Research president believes between now and the end of next year, the index will soar 17% from current levels. “I’ve got 3,500 as my target for next year,” he told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “We’ll get there on higher earnings with maybe somewhat higher valuation as the perception continues to be that interest rates aren’t going up much, if at all.” Despite the major indexes breaking a three week win streak on Friday, Yardeni highlights the market’s recent composure for his latest bullish forecast. He gives the drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure last weekend as an example of what could have been easily viewed as a strong catalyst for a deep sell-off. “That would have been a good opportunity to have a significant sell-off. Instead, it was pretty puny,” Yardeni said. “The market is hanging in there and should do better over the rest of the year.” Yardeni, who spent decades on the Street running investment strategy for firms that include Prudential and Deutsche Bank, builds his bullish case on the notion that Washington and Beijing agree to a trade war deal, a strong U.S. jobs market that’ll keep consumers spending and a global economy on the mend due to easy central bank policies. The positive developments will create momentum for growth stocks through 2020, according to Yardeni. He doubts value, which recently got a bid higher, will outperform in the coming months. “This has been a very interesting bull market. It seems to every now and then let the leaders become laggards and the laggards become leaders. There is a lot of rotation going on in this market from the get-go,” he said. “I don’t know if I’d read too much into it.” Yardeni contends investors were drawn to value because it got so cheap, writing in a recent note “forward P/Es of growth and value stocks hadn’t been this wide since the go-go days of the tech bubble and its aftermath.” He speculates growth stocks will be lead the market to new highs, listing consumer discretionary, semiconductors and financials as the biggest beneficiaries. “The economy is doing fine and the fundamentals for stocks moving higher are still intact,” Yardeni said.

1,Consider This Before Buying American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) For The 1.4% Dividend - Simply Wall St News,Consider This Before Buying American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) For The 1.4% Dividend. Payout ratios. Is American Airlines Group's Balance,"Could American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful. So you might want to consider getting our latest analysis on American Airlines Group's financial health here. With a 1.4% yield and a five-year payment history, investors probably think American Airlines Group looks like a reliable dividend stock. A low yield is generally a turn-off, but if the prospects for earnings growth were strong, investors might be pleasantly surprised by the long-term results. The company also returned around 5.0% of its market capitalisation to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks over the past year. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on American Airlines Group! Companies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, American Airlines Group paid out 12% of its profit as dividends. We'd say its dividends are thoroughly covered by earnings. We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Unfortunately, while American Airlines Group pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective. As American Airlines Group has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure","Sep 22, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group/news/consider-this-before-buying-american-airlines-group-inc-nasdaqaal-for-the-1-4-dividend

SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 22 2019."," Kenya Airways planes on the taxi bay at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Kenya's capital Nairobi on March 6, 2019. PHOTO | FILE | NATION MEDIA GROUP Kenya Airways stock on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) has fallen 71 per cent in the past 12 months as both financial and management crisis weigh down the 42-year-old carrier whose revival now hinges on a planned takeover by the government. Last week, the airline’s share price on the Nairobi bourse fell to as low as Ksh2.39 ($0.02) per share on September 18 from Ksh8.30 ($0.08) per share in the same period last year as the market reacted to news of the suspension of the chief financial officer Hellen Mathuka. Further instability is expected when CEO Sebastian Mikosz quits at the end of the year after declining to extend his three-year contract, which expires on December 31. Earlier in July, chief operating officer Jan De Vegt, who was seconded by partner KLM, resigned after serving for three years. The move pointed to a deteriorating relationship between the two airlines. SHARES A cross-section of analysts polled by The EastAfrican said investors are desperate to offload the airline’s shares owing to the uncertainty surrounding its revival while its planned takeover by the government does not guarantee premium to their share sell. “KQ will take some time to recover. I would imagine most shareholders are not expecting premiums during the takeover and they would prefer selling the shares at the prevailing market price,” said Eric Musau, head of research at Standard Investment Bank. “The share price has gone down but it’s a matter of demand and supply,” he added. Eric Munywoki, an independent financial analyst said KQ’s management has to quickly rethink the airline’s business model to survive increasing competition from regional and Middle East carriers such as Emirates, Qatar and Etihad. Ethiopian and Rwandan airlines have eaten into KQ’s market share while Uganda and Tanzania are revamping their national carriers. “In the short-term we don’t expect the share price to improve because the company’s performance has not been strong over the past three years,” said Mr Munywoki. Over the past six years, the airline’s stock has declined by over 74 per cent to Ksh2.39 ($0.02) per share from Ksh9.40 ($0.09) per share while the volume of shares traded have declined by 96 per cent to 24,500 from 680,000 in the same period, according to","Sep 22, 2019",https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/kq-stock-plummets-fuelled-by-financial-management-woes-1427776
3,Best Stocks Under $5.00 for 2020 | MarketBeat,. . Best Stocks Under $5.00 for 2020. Best Stocks Under $5 - What You Need to Know Before You,"  When you think of those mythical, rags-to-riches stories of someone striking it big in the stock market, what you’re most likely thinking of is someone who scored it big with stocks under $5, which are also called penny stocks. Before getting involved in stocks under 5 dollars, there are a few important things to know. Penny stocks don’t literally have to be priced at pennies, though some are just that. Penny stocks refer to stocks that generally trade under $5 a share. A broader question might be, “Should I buy stocks?” The answer to both questions is the same: It depends. You should not buy stocks if you don’t have a discriminating sense of how to invest money, or if you don’t have guidance around the topic from someone who does. With the right knowledge, stocks are an excellent investment, and according to some estimates, far more sound than real estate. Yes, stock prices do fluctuate (sometimes wildly), but over the last several decades, they have outperformed real estate in some regards. Investors who know what they’re doing with stocks can make huge gains, build enormous wealth, and create exponential financial success. Stocks under $5, in particular, present an incredible opportunity to make huge gains. It all comes down to research. You never want to sink all of your investment cash into just one basket. Estimates vary on the exact percentage, but most experts agree that the majority of your portfolio should be invested in solid, stable companies. That said, stocks under $5 can be a good place to do a little value investing and give some growth to your cash. It’s important to keep in mind that there are many trading strategies in relation to the stock market, and investing in undervalued, up-and-coming companies is only one strategy. For example, some investors prefer to focus on stocks that pay out dividends, where each share pays out dividend payments of company profit—and a large number of shares creates a solid cash flow. Other investors like to buy shares in specific industries, like tech stocks, or they may choose to ride the market as they engage in the ups and downs of day trading, flipping stocks for profit. Whichever stock trading strategy you prefer, penny stocks can be some of the best growth stocks for their undervalued cost—if you trade the right way.

The communications threaten to upend Boeing’s efforts to rebuild public trust in the 737 Max “Boeing has tested over 800 test flights (on B737Max) and is working on improving the training process involving B737Max. We are working closely with regulators round the world to bring the aircraft back to service,” said Darren Hulst, director (product, forecast and current market), Boeing Commercial Aircraft. ""We are working with pilot community...of the customer airlines and the flight attendants.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   President Trump may have claimed in July that Apple wouldn't get tariff exemptions for the redesigned Mac Pro, but the reality is very different. The US Trade Representative's office has confirmed that regulators approved 10 out of 15 of the company's tariff exemptions for computer components focusing primarily on the Mac Pro. It's not certain how much any remaining tariffs will affect pricing for the workstation, but any damage will clearly be limited. Reports have circulated that Apple was moving production to China, but that's not necessarily the case. Tim Cook mentioned during Apple's latest earnings call that the company wanted to keep making Mac Pros in the US and was investing in additional capacity. Even if Apple does assemble the reworked Mac in the US, though, tariffs could still be painful. Many of the parts Apple needs are still likely to be made in China, and those costs could quickly add up. The company isn't alone, either. Regulators also pulled tariffs for electronics that affect other PC makers, including those for partial circuit boards and graphics cards. If they hadn't, there was a good possibility that many computers would have become more expensive, including homebuilt PCs using Chinese parts. Apple has simply been one of the largest targets, and still risks significant cost increases if the US goes forward with a new round of tariffs on December 15th.

In the matter of Jet Airways","The legal representative of the resolution professional (RP) for Jet Airways on Friday submitted a progress report on the resolution plan of the airline to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The legal counsel also sought directions from the NCLT asking some lenders of the airline to expedite the release of interim funding for the insolvency proceedings. The tribunal will hear the matter on October 9. In the first meeting of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) in July, lenders to Jet had sanctioned interim funding of around Rs 70 crore. Of the approved amount, only the State Bank of India has disbursed funds so far. Some lenders are yet to sanction the disbursal, the RP’s legal counsel told the tribunal. “The initial disbursement is almost exhausted. That means that the corporate insolvency resolution process could come to a grinding halt,” the legal representative to the RP told the tribunal. In the matter of Jet Airways vacating its headquarters in Mumbai, the two-member bench of the tribunal asked the RP’s legal counsel to submit the CoC’s resolution regarding the settlement reached with the owner of the property. The CoC and Luckystar, owner of Siroya Centre, the property where Jet is currently headquartered, have agreed on the terms for the settlement. Jet is expected to vacate the premises in 45 days once the two parties formally come to a settlement on the dues. The RP’s legal counsel informed the tribunal that the Synergy Group had met lenders and government representatives on the resolution of Jet Airways and the RP is optimistic on the same. Earlier this week, FE reported that the government assured Synergy Group, the sole suitor for the grounded airline, that returning Jet’s slots after March should not be an issue. Jet Airways was grounded on April 17 after lenders refused to provide emergency funding. Insolvency proceedings against the airline were initiated on June 20. Creditors have filed claims worth Rs 30,907 crore against the defunct airline so far.
