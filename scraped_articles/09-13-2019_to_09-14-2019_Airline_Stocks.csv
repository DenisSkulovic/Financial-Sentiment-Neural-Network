Company Here; Stock; Barronâ??s.","  A weekly guide to our best stories on technology, disruption, and the people and stocks in the middle of it all.  Airline stocks have been all over the map this year, but Macquarie thinks that there’s more runway ahead for both one of the best performers in the group and one of the worst. The back story. It has been an interesting year for airline investors. Companies like Delta Air Lines (ticker: DAL) have risen more than 20% in 2019, helped by strong earnings
and the fact that they weren’t hurt by the continuing grounding
of Boeing’s (BA) 737 MAX aircraft.   Stock in American Airlines Group (AAL), another so-called legacy carrier, is firmly in the red
. The shares have been hurt by lackluster earnings
, debt worries, and the rescheduling headaches that have come from its reliance on the grounded Boeing planes.   Spirit Airlines (SAVE), which stood out at the end of 2018
, hasn’t been able to keep pace this year, falling more than 33% because of concern about rising costs. Southwest Airlines (LUV), which took a hit from the government shutdown
and the loss of the 737 MAX
, has managed to rebound. The stock is up 20% so far in 2019.    What’s new. On Friday, Macquarie analyst Susan Donofrio—who has long advocated owning
the Big Three legacy airlines—raised her ratings on both Southwest and Spirit to Outperform from Neutral. She increased her price target by $15 to $67 for the former and kept a $47 target on the latter.  She said “a focused and competitive management team with new tools” will be able to extend Southwest’s recent rally, and that her upgrade of Spirit reflects its depressed valuation. The stock has slumped in the face of expectations that bubbled too high last year. “We think that this is fixable and sets the company up well for 2020 outperformance,” Donofrio said. Looking ahead. Spirit and Southwest still are not Donofrio’s favorites in the industry. “We are recommending United Airlines (UAL), Delta, and Allegiant (ALGT) as they form the trifecta of quality companies where we think that ongoing revenue initiatives (in the case of United and Delta) or minimal competitive route overlap (roughly 75% of Allegiant’s routes face no competition) are likely to offset what we see as a softer fare environment given tougher year-over-year comps this fall and higher supply likely next year,” Southwest","Sep 14, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/2-airline-stocks-southwest-spirit-upgrade-outperform-rise-bullish-51568413187
1,Alphabet is heading for an upside breakout—here's how to trade it,Alphabet is heading for an upside breakout—here’s how to trade it. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"Call it the ABCs of trading. As stocks have stabilized after August’s volatile rout, Google parent Alphabet’s chart has formed a consolidation pattern, a series of higher lows and lower highs in the stock that tend to reflect uncertainty or indecision among investors, said Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com. Many traders take that pattern as a sign that a given stock will soon break out of its ever-tightening range — that either the buyers driving it higher or the sellers keeping a lid on its gains will “win out,” Gordon said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” Alphabet’s newfound range is likely tied to investors’ broader rotation out of high-performance areas of the market like the technology and consumer discretionary sectors and into value plays like energy stocks. But those moves don’t necessarily spell trouble for the Google and YouTube parent, Gordon said. “I do see Google moving up and out of this consolidation through [$]1,275,” he said. Alphabet Class A shares were trading around the $1,233 level early in Friday’s session, down less than 1%. “Soon ... I believe, the buyers will step in and take us out of this range,” the longtime trader and chart analyst said.  The trade Gordon put on to capitalize on the expected move highlighted his bullish outlook. He bought $1,300 monthly call options expiring in November and sold the $1,340 November monthly calls in what’s known as a vertical call spread, which cost him about $10.95 at the time of the trade on Thursday. “That’s a $40 spread. That means that there’s $4,000 of potential profit here, but you’re not going to get that full $4,000. You have to pay a premium to get in,” he said, referencing that $10.95 cost. That spread represents a bet that Alphabet shares could run to at least $1,300 by the end of November — a roughly 5% move from their current levels — if not all the way to $1,340, which would be a nearly 9% climb. Gordon also called viewers’ attention to the standard deviation, a statistic used by many options traders to anticipate a stock’s likeliest future moves. “They’re looking for a move as high as [$]1,340 in the life of these options ... so the $1,340 call was chosen specifically because of that standard deviation,” he said. And, as always, Gordon recommended to “position-size according to your specific risk profile [and] what you’re","Sep 13, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/13/alphabet-is-heading-for-an-upside-breakoutheres-how-to-trade-it.html
2,Here's Why Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,. . . . Here's Why Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly. What Risk Does Debt Bring?. How,"                                                   David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky. Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines As you can see below, Southwest Airlines had US$2.45b of debt at June 2019, down from US$3.54b a year prior. But on the other hand it also has US$3.99b in cash, leading to a US$1.54b net cash position. According to the last reported balance sheet, Southwest Airlines had liabilities of US$8.61b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$7.82b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.99b in cash and US$777.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$11.7b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables. While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Southwest Airlines has a huge market capitalization of US$29.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Southwest Airlines also",17 hours ago,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-southwest-airlines-nyse-133127911.html

The airline has appointed Morgan Stanley, JM Financial, ICICI Securities","GoAir, the country’s fourth largest airline by market share, is looking to raise close to Rs 5,000 crore through its initial public offer (IPO). Sources close to the matter claim that the airline is looking to dilute around 25% or more for the same. The airline has appointed Morgan Stanley, JM Financial, ICICI Securities and Citi as lead bankers for its public issue. ICICI Securities and JM Financial did not respond to queries till the time of going to press. FE has also learned from reliable sources that the draft red herring prospectus is expected to be filed before November end and that the airline is aiming for a listing in February/March 2020. The airline has been keen on listing its shares for few years now as it has been profitable, but chose to hold back in 2016 due to concerns on valuation. The airline has expanded at a break-neck speed since then and is now looking at the equity dilution to fund its expansion plans through an IPO. After reviewing economy and the sector, the airline decided to double its aircraft orders from 72 aircraft to 144 in 2016. The airline is expecting deliveries of at least one aircraft every month, but sources claim that Airbus is expected to deliver 15 planes instead of the expected 18 each year. In a matter of two years, the airline has doubled its fleet size to 50 aircraft. The airline has gained market share, especially after Jet Airways was grounded in April this year to 11.1% in July, up from 9.2% in March 2019. GoAir currently operates 320 flights a day compared to 230 daily flights a year ago and flies to seven international destinations; it will add Kuwait and Singaore as new destinations this month.

6,A Closer Look At Southwest Airlines Co.'s (NYSE:LUV) Impressive ROE - Simply Wall St News,A Closer Look At Southwest Airlines Co.'s (NYSE:LUV) Impressive ROE. How Do You Calculate ROE?. What Does ROE Signify?. Does,"While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV). Our data shows Southwest Airlines has a return on equity of 24% for the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn $0.24. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders' Equity Or for Southwest Airlines: 24% = US$2.4b ÷ US$9.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.) Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets. ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies. One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Southwest Airlines has a superior ROE than the average (19%) company in the Airlines industry. That is a good sign. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example, I often check if insiders have been buying shares . Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along","Sep 13, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-luv/southwest-airlines/news/a-closer-look-at-southwest-airlines-co-s-nyseluv-impressive-roe

BT newsletters. TRANSPORT. Airports"," [HANOI] Vietnam's Vietravel Airlines plans to launch its first flight next year, chief executive Vu Duc Bien said, joining a rising number of entrants in one of the world's fast-growing aviation markets. Vietravel Airlines, owned by the country's leading tour operator Vietravel, will start with three to four leased planes and expects to place an order for an Airbus or Boeing narrowbody jet at the Singapore Airshow in February, which will be scheduled for delivery within five years, Mr Bien told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. ""We will buy either Airbus's A321neo or Boeing's 737 aircraft,"" he said. The aviation market of Vietnam, which has a population of 96 million people, has been growing at double-digit rates, encouraging companies to compete for a slice.   Vietnam's largest conglomerate Vingroup JSC had applied for a licence to launch an airline next year, after property and leisure firm FLC Group's Bamboo Airways started its maiden commercial flight in January to become the fifth Vietnamese airline.

""We already have passengers even before we launched our first flight,"" Mr Bien said, noting that Vietravel served around 1 million travellers last year, with half of them travelling by air. Vietravel Airlines plans to operate three to four aircraft in the first year, he said, adding that the company will expand its fleet to six aircraft in the second year, 8 to 10 within five years, and later bring it to 20 to 30. ""A majority will be international flights,"" he said. ""Our target markets are Japan, South Korea, Asean, Australia and China."" He said Vietravel Airlines has raised 700 billion dong (S$41.4 million) via a bond sale, and is planning to sell a stake of up to 34 per cent of the company within one year of operations for future expansion plans.

Two New Stock,"      Amy Legate-Wolfe | September 13, 2019 | More on: TD LSPD TD I’ll be the first to admit that when I first opened a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), it was all pretty overwhelming. I opened the account during one of the first few years, with contribution room far lower than the $63,500 that it has reached today. Back then, I was mainly worried about over-contributing, which could result in taxes from the government. Now that the contribution room is much higher, however, I don’t worry so much about over-contributing. Not as a millennial. While I do have some savings, I don’t feel I’ll reach that level of contribution for a few years. With a toddler, a baby on the way, and a mortgage to pay for, I can’t have cash just sitting around. Even if that cash is making me money. And, frankly, I’m one of the lucky ones. Yet there are plenty of other errors millennials could be making, and some are all too common. But the biggest problem besides over contributing can still cost you some serious cash. That problem: foreign investments. I made this mistake early on, as it isn’t a common concern that comes up with your banker when you open a TFSA. This can be seriously harmful, as some of the more popular stocks out there are usually what new investors will seek out first, and those stocks a lot of the time are from the United States. Take me for an example. I decided to buy a few Tesla stocks and Nvidia when I opened my TFSA, and within a year I found myself regretting it. While the stocks themselves did alright at the time, I discovered that U.S. stocks are subject to a withholding tax when put in a TFSA. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levies a 15% withholding tax on any dividends that come from these foreign investments. That doesn’t just mean individual stocks either. This can come from mutual or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that own U.S. stocks as well. So, if you’re looking to buy up a fund with some U.S. diversification, be very careful. But there are ways to get some foreign diversification and stay away from the tax man. Consider banking stocks. Canadian banking stocks are a great way to see conservative growth, while also bringing in some diversification to your portfolio.

Every month, TD Ameritrade puts out a proprietary behavior-based index based on the stock trading behavior of its clients, called the Investor Movement Index, or IMX. There are some critical pieces of data to come out of the IMX, the most important of which is that Millennials apparently have no idea how to buy stocks or build a proper long-term diversified portfolio. We would expect to see different demographics buy and sell different stocks for their portfolios because every age group tends to have different wealth-directed goals. For example, we would expect senior citizens to buy more income-generating equities, while those in the 30 to 65 age range would have a more balanced mixture. We would expect Millennials to tilt more towards growth stocks. What TD Ameritrade found is that Millennials are taking on enormous amounts of risk by purchasing some of the most volatile names in the market, and failing to construct long-term diversified portfolios that are also geared to hedge risk. In short, Millennials suck at buying stocks. In August, TD Ameritrade’s IMX says that Millennial accounts brought two major cannabis names: Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth Corporation. Marijuana stocks were all the rage in 2018, driven by the explosive short squeeze in Tilray. That stock exploded from $30 to $200 in a matter of days, and everyone started piling into pot.

The CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX, is supposed to be one of the most reliable indicators of investor sentiment on Wall Street. The number, which can range anywhere from 1 to 100, provides important insight into how well the S&P 500 Index is performing. So, when the VIX swung below the usually benign 15 level on Wednesday, investors were told to breathe a sigh of relief as it became apparent that equities were returning to record levels. But a closer look at the volatility gauge reveals now is not the time to be complacent. Surging equity prices this month have put downward pressure on the VIX, which maintains a historic average of around 20. Anything below that level is seen as positive for stocks. The so-called “investor fear index” declined 8.4% this week and is down a whopping 44% from the August peak. On Friday, it closed at 13.74, the lowest since late July. Although past performance is no guarantee of the future, the VIX is moving in an eerily similar pattern as before the December stock market slump. As a refresher, U.S. stocks broke all-time highs at the end of September 2018, with the S&P 500 clocking in above 2,930. Soon thereafter, markets embarked on their biggest correction since the financial crisis.

The corporation, in its preliminary financial audit, estimates it could incur a staggering Rs1.5 billion in losses in the last fiscal year, which ended mid-July. Over the decades, the airline has not just haemorrhaged money but has also lost the public’s trust with its inefficiency. Last November, the corporation said that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and asked for a bailout of Rs20 billion, declaring itself crisis-ridden. This revelation came just four months after the airlines made the biggest purchase in Nepali aviation history, acquiring two Airbus A330-200s for $209.6 million. Even at that time, the corporation had become a highly leveraged company, with debt reaching critical levels—about Rs37 billion. Last month, the Tourism Ministry formed a task force to find out what is hampering Nepal Airlines’ growth. The task force is the seventh of its kind in two decades, but almost none of the recommendations made by past task forces have ever been implemented. The purchase of the new A330s, along with two other A320s, was meant to revitalise Nepal Airlines, but a lack of planning and a series of problems meant that those new aircraft were never put into proper operation and in full capacity.

Behind the downfall of what was once the country’s largest employer and the largest earner of foreign currency are the same two evils that plague most other public bodies in Nepal—mismanagement and corruption. The undoing of Nepal Airlines was most recently visible in its attempt to resume flights to Japan again. Within a week of operating flights to Osaka last month, the airlines had to cut its flight frequency from three times a week to two, because it had no passengers. “On some days, there","Sep 14, 2019",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2019/09/14/the-rise-and-fall-of-nepal-airlines
