0,Airline Stocks Are Worth Buying. The Industry Has Changed. | Barron's,"Airline Stocks Are Trouble, History Says. It’s Time to Take Another Look.. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily. . Oil Is","  A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.  History weighs heavily
on the minds of airline investors, keeping a lid on stocks’ valuations. Yet the industry has undergone enormous change over the past decade, so it’s possible that the market isn’t giving airline stocks a fair shake.  There has been plenty of reason for concern. Multiple bankruptcies, oil- price shocks, labor strife, and too rapid capacity growth are high on the list. It wasn’t so long ago that Warren Buffett said the best way to become a millionaire was to start out a billionaire and buy an airline. The smart money, it seems, avoids airlines. Perhaps it shouldn’t. For starters, the four largest U.S. carriers, including their regional affiliates, have about 80% of the domestic market. The business is still competitive, but the sector looks more like an oligopoly now. Economic theory suggests having a handful of companies control most of the market leads to better profits. So the structure of the industry favors airlines now. What about oil, capacity, and labor? Oil prices don’t really matter for the sector. That may surprise investors. Energy prices are certainly important. The four major U.S. airlines have spent more than $140 billion on jet fuel over the past five years, about 20% of sales. That’s a lot, but everyone pays roughly the same amount for fuel, so as long as prices are stable, airfares adjust and no airline has a competitive advantage—or disadvantage. The playing field wasn’t level at the turn of the century, when oil prices went from $20 a barrel to $140 between 2001 and 2008. The rapid rise was problematic—higher ticket prices hurt demand—but a bigger deal was differences in fuel-hedging policies among airlines. Southwest Airlines (ticker: LUV) has always hedged fuel. As prices escalated at the turn of the century it was a hefty benefit. From 2002 to 2008, Southwest’s hedges earned the low-cost airline more than $3.2 billion—close to the carrier’s aggregate operating profit over that span. Precisely defining the impact on domestic fares is difficult, but ticket prices would have had to rise for Southwest to earn similar margins in the absence of hedges. “One of the main reasons we hedge our oil is to protect against unexpected events,” a Southwest spokesperson tells Barron’s. “We’re one of the few in","Sep 30, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-stocks-delta-southwest-american-buy-fuel-labor-51569621113
1,Delta Bulks Up in South America With $1.9 Billion LATAM Investment | The Motley Fool,Delta Bulks Up in South America With $1.9 Billion LATAM Investment. The biggest airline group in Latin America has abandoned,"   Just a few months ago, LATAM Airlines (NYSE: LTM) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) seemed to be on track to finalize a joint venture agreement covering travel between the U.S. and South America by the end of 2019. But in late May, Chile's Supreme Court blocked the two carriers from cooperating in Chile, citing the dominant market position they would have. Initially, LATAM and American said they would proceed with their joint venture plans for the rest of South America, leaving Chile out. (LATAM is also the biggest airline in Brazil and has smaller subsidiaries in several other countries.) However, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) saw this setback for the American Airlines-LATAM joint venture as a can't-miss opportunity. Last Thursday, Delta announced that it would buy a 20% stake in LATAM for $1.9 billion as a prelude to forming a full joint venture with South America's largest airline. This move will further entrench Delta's position as the most profitable of the three U.S. legacy carriers. DELTA WILL TAKE A 20% STAKE IN LATAM AIRLINES AND THE TWO CARRIERS PLAN TO FORM A JOINT VENTURE. IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. Under the deal announced last week, Delta Air Lines and LATAM Airlines will form a comprehensive strategic partnership. Later this year, they will begin codesharing, allowing customers to make seamless connections between the two airlines. Delta and LATAM will also apply for antitrust immunity so they can form a joint venture. That would allow them to coordinate schedules and pricing to maximize the profitability of existing routes and make new routes viable. The two carriers would share the revenue and costs from the joint venture, encouraging close cooperation. Whereas American Airlines and LATAM are the top two airlines for flights between the U.S. and Latin America -- which ultimately caused their joint venture plan to be blocked in Chile -- Delta is currently the No. 4 airline between the U.S. and South America. As a result, the chance of a regulatory challenge is much lower. Delta's management believes it will take 12 to 24 months to receive regulatory approval and implement the joint venture. The agreement also calls for Delta to buy four Airbus A350s from LATAM and take over 10 of the latter's A350 orders. This will help LATAM rationalize its fleet and reduce future capex. Delta will receive these 14 widebodies between late 2020 and 2025. DELTA AIR","Sep 30, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/09/30/delta-bulks-up-in-south-america-with-19-billion-la.aspx
2,Southwest Airlines Accelerates Its Hawaii Expansion | The Motley Fool,Southwest Airlines Accelerates Its Hawaii Expansion. The airline giant just moved up the start date for two new routes and,"   For most of the past year, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has been delaying its plans for growth in Hawaii. Initially, it took a little longer than expected for the carrier to gain FAA approval to begin long overwater flights. This scuttled its ambition to launch at least one route to Hawaii before the end of 2018. Ultimately, Southwest wasn't able to begin flying to Hawaii until March 2019. More recently, the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX prevented Southwest from expanding quickly beyond its initial set of four West Coast-Hawaii routes and two interisland routes. However, Southwest Airlines announced last month that it was ready to resume its growth in Hawaii. And earlier this week, the popular low-fare airline accelerated and expanded its plans to add more service to and within Hawaii, challenging incumbents Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK). In mid-August, Southwest Airlines said that it would start service on three new interisland routes next January: Honolulu-Lihue (four daily round trips), Honolulu-Hilo (four daily round trips), and Kahului-Kona (one daily round trip). It also announced five new West Coast-Hawaii routes that would begin at the same time, including Sacramento-Honolulu service and flights from Oakland to Kona and Lihue and from San Jose to Kona and Lihue. Southwest will fly the Sacramento-Honolulu route daily, while the other routes will operate three or four times per week. SOUTHWEST AIRLINES IS READY TO RAMP UP ITS GROWTH IN HAWAII. IMAGE SOURCE: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. On Thursday, Southwest advanced the start date for its Honolulu-Lihue and Sacramento-Honolulu flights. Rather than beginning on Jan. 19, 2020, service will launch on Nov. 10, 2019 for both of these routes. Additionally, the carrier plans further growth in the West Coast-Hawaii market in early 2020. All four new routes connecting Oakland and San Jose to Kona and Lihue will be upgraded to daily service in early March. That will roughly double Southwest's capacity in those markets compared to its previous plan. Southwest Airlines also announced another new route: It will begin daily Sacramento-Kahului service on March 7. Southwest's plan to accelerate the launch of two of its new routes isn't very significant in the long run. By contrast, adding six more daily round trips between Northern California and Hawaii over the next six months -- up from three additional daily round trips under its previous plan -- will ramp up the competitive pressure on Hawaiian","Sep 29, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/09/29/southwest-airlines-accelerates-hawaii-expansion.aspx

4,The Best Way To Earn Airline Miles,MORE FROM FORBES. The Best Way To Earn Airline Miles. The Earning Story:  Spending Money to Get Miles and,"A screen at Logan International Airport in Boston last July. Photocredit: Scott Eisen/Bloomberg... [+] On the surface, airline miles appear free. You earn them by signing up for free airline miles programs. You earn them when using an airline's credit card. Unless you outright buy miles, and putting aside any annual credit card fees, miles more or less cost nothing. Or do they? The fact is that airline miles are not free. We make choices as to which airlines to fly and which credit card to use. These choices carry opportunity costs. Flying Delta means you didn’t fly Southwest or JetBlue. Paying with a card that earns you miles might mean passing up a chance to pull out a card that earns you cash back. That’s why it’s important to understand the true cost of miles. Considering the big six airlines in the United States (American, Delta, United, Southwest, JetBlue, and Alaska), I provide a simplified approach to figuring out the total valuation of airline miles.  I cover a variety of topics on both sides of the valuation. In this article I focus on the cost to earn miles. (In a subsequent article, we’ll look at the best way to redeem the miles you’ve earned).  My goal is to simplify how the process works.  After reading this article, you should understand how much accruing airline miles really costs. To illustrate this valuation, I am going to open up my airlines rewards wallet and see what is inside. In the past two years, I earned miles or points from air travel, hotel stays, car rentals, airline rewards credit cards, buying points, and affiliate shopping sites.  Each type of purchase offered a certain variety of cost per mile.  Some opportunities proved to be far more affordable than others. PROMOTED To be exceptionally clear, when I refer to “miles” or “points” throughout the details presented, I am referring to redeemable miles -- not necessarily elite-status qualifying points.  In the case of Alaska, Southwest, and JetBlue, their redeemable miles (or points) are also used to qualify for elite status. But Delta, United, and American have a different set of non-redeemable miles that are used to qualify for elite status. The cost to earn elite-qualifying miles on those airlines is an entirely different discussion. Here, we are focusing on the cost of the miles (or points) that you can","Sep 29, 2019",https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2019/09/29/the-best-way-to-earn-airline-miles/

Brett Smith – Takes on a one-of-a-kind challenge and an opportunity to do,"Snohomish County's Voice and Vision Magazine BRYAN CORLISS The tall man in the slacks and jacket moves through the big room. He straightens chairs. He sweeps crumbs off a table, and picks up a napkin and paper plate somebody left behind. He straightens an arrangement of fresh flowers on a table. Most of the people in the big room ignore him. They’re sitting in comfortable lounge chairs, or perched at a nearby bar. They’re staring at their phones, chatting with each other or picking up a meal of Beecher’s macaroni and cheese. A few children quietly play with small toys. At the bar, a man reads a book while he noshes on a board of prosciutto with artisan cheese and a demi-baguette. James Taylor croons ‘70s soft-rock over the sound system. A lady takes a selfie. In short, it’s not your typical scene in an airport lounge about 15 minutes before boarding. Propeller Airports CEO Brett Smith says he’s hands-on with his management of the Paine Field air terminal for a reason. “It’s like somebody’s coming to your house for dinner or drinks,”
he said. “You want it to present well.” Only in his case, he had about 300,000 drop by during the first three months his living room was open. That was the number of people who arrived or departed on flights from Paine in the first five months after it opened on March 4. “Those are 300,000 people who have been saved the drive down the I-5 corridor to Sea-Tac airport,” noted Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers.

It was one of dozens of airfields nationwide built during those years, including Chicago Midway, Honolulu International and New York City’s LaGuardia. It was named after Topliff Paine, an Everett High School graduate who went on to serve as a lieutenant flying in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War I, and then was a pilot in the early years of the U.S. Post Office’s Air Mail Service. Travelers through the terminal today might spot a life-size statue of Lieutenant Paine on the sidewalk outside.

9,Top Two Ways Corporations Raise Capital,Top Two Ways Corporations Raise Capital. . KEY TAKEAWAYS. Debt Capital. Example of Debt Capital. . Equity Capital. . Example,"Running a business requires a great deal of capital. Capital can take different forms, from human and labor capital to economic capital. But when most of us hear the term financial capital, the first thing that comes to mind is usually money. While it can mean different things, it isn't necessarily untrue. Financial capital is represented by assets, securities, and yes, cash. Having access to cash can mean the difference between companies expanding or staying behind and being left in the lurch. But how can companies raise the capital they need to keep them going and to fund their future projects? And what options do they have available? There are two types of capital that a company can use to fund operations: Debt and equity. Prudent corporate finance practice involves determining the mix of debt and equity that is most cost-effective. This article examines both kinds of capital, and how........ Debt capital is also referred to as debt financing. Funding by means of debt capital happens when a company borrows money and agrees to pay it back to the lender at a later date. The most common types of debt capital companies use are loans and bonds—the two most common ways larger companies use to fuel their expansion plans or to fund new projects. Smaller businesses may even use credit cards to raise their own capital. A company looking to raise capital through debt may need to approach a bank for a loan, where the bank becomes the lender and the company becomes the debtor. In exchange for the loan, the bank charges interest, which the company will note, along with the loan, on its balance sheet. The other option is to issue corporate bonds. These bonds are sold to investors—also known as bondholders or lenders—and mature after a certain date. Before reaching maturity, the company is responsible for issuing interest payments on the bond to investors. Because they generally come with a high amount of risk—the chances of default are higher than bonds issued by the government—they pay a much higher yield. The money raised from bond issuance can be used by the company for its expansion plans. While this is a great way to raise much-needed money, debt capital does come with a downside: It comes the additional burden of interest. This expense, incurred just for the privilege of accessing funds, is referred to as the cost of","Sep 29, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-are-different-ways-corporations-can-raise-capital.asp

12,Dow Futures Rally as Treasury Yield Spread Approaches Dangerous Level,"Dow Futures Rally as Treasury Yield Spread Approaches Dangerous Level. Dow Futures Rally; S&P 500, Nasdaq Follow. Bond Markets Come","By: Sam Bourgi | Email | Leave a comment Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose in overnight trading Monday, as China trade optimism caused investors to look beyond a breakdown in U.S. Treasury yields. The three main U.S. futures contracts reported gains Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 98 points, or 0.4.%, to 26,894.00. The futures contract was up by as much as 144 points. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.4% to 2,975.50. The Nasdaq 100 futures contract jumped 0.5% to 7,739.74. U.S. equities recoiled Friday amid reports that the Trump administration was looking to implement new constraints on Chinese investments – a move that would mark a dramatic escalation in the ongoing trade war. Although the U.S. Treasury has since denied the reports, plans for further escalation have apparently been discussed within the Trump administration.   The spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasurys – the stock market’s most trusted barometer for recession – has narrowed in recent weeks, sending a strong signal that another inversion was on the horizon. A yield curve inversion happens when bonds with shorter maturities yield more than their long-term counterparts, a phenomenon that effectively negates the value of time in the monetary system. Inverted yield curves have predicted the past seven recessions with razor accuracy. At the time of writing, the yield spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes was around 6 basis points. A narrowing of the spread to zero or below would trigger another recession warning like the one we saw in August. At the time, safe-haven buying drove investors into fixed-income securities, which dragged the 10-year yield toward record lows. Inverted yield curves usually predict recession – i.e., back-to-back quarters of negative growth – 22 months later. Sam Bourgi edited this article for CCN.com - Capital & Celeb News.

Facebook (FB) has been in a bull market ever since it took out resistance of $40 in August 2013. The strong uptrend catapulted the equity to an all-time high of $218.62 in July 2018. That’s an impressive growth of close to 450% in five years. Since then, the security has been correcting. The significant pullback is making many investors jittery. It appears that it may be time to dump FB shares. A former Goldman Sachs employee revealed that Facebook executives have already sold a ton of shares. September was another month of profit-taking for Facebook. However, what’s out of the ordinary this month is that the social media giant’s executives were the ones selling shares. Will Meade, a former Goldman Sachs analyst, took to Twitter to reveal how Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and David Fischer sold millions of FB shares in September. We did the math and discovered that these three executives sold over 2.24 million shares to the tune of more than $418 million. Zuckerberg himself dumped over 2 million shares and gave himself a nice profit of $396 million. Sheryl Sandberg, the tech giant’s chief operating officer, sold 110,000 shares for a nice $20 million profit. Last is Facebook’s chief revenue officer, David Fischer, who sold 12,267 shares for a take home pay of $2.25 million.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   At the start of the race, Impul driver Ryo Hirakawa pulled clear from pole position, with Dandelion driver Nirei Fukuzumi passing Kondo pair Yuji Kunimoto and Yamashita to jump to second. However, Fukuzumi spun on the entry to Attwood on lap 8 of what turned out to be a 66-lap race, bringing out the safety car and splitting the field strategy-wise. Race leader Hirakawa stayed out on track along with a small batch of drivers, while the remainder of the field led by Yamashita pitted when the pit window opened on lap 11. At the restart, Hirakawa again retained his lead, but was unable to pull a gap of more than two seconds at any point. That brought TOM'S man Cassidy, also yet to pit, into contention later in the race, the Kiwi bringing down the deficit to less than a second by lap 45. Hirakawa initially managed to contain the threat from his SUPER GT teammate, but Cassidy caught the back of the Japanese driver again on lap 56. Two laps later, Cassidy dived down the inside of Hirakawa at the hairpin, making the move stick to take the lead on track. All Super Formula races are streamed live and for free on Motorsport.tv. However, at this point Cassidy’s gap to Yamashita was roughly 25 seconds, which proved to be insufficient when he finally stopped on lap 60. After all leading cars had pitted, Yamashita, who has also been competing in the FIA World Endurance Championship's LMP2 class with Toyota backing, assumed the lead and went on to score Kondo’s first victory since Cassidy drove for the team in 2018. TOM’S driver Kazuki Nakajima finished second to secure his best result of the season, while Harrison Newey finished third to clinch his first Super Formula podium since joining the series at the start of the year. Alex Palou was the best of the Nakajima Racing runners in fourth, while Newey’s B-Max by Motopark teammate Lucas Auer was fifth.

The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 35.64 points at 16,658.63 as it was dragged down by health care, materials and energy sectors. Each quarter has been positive but the third-quarter gain was the smallest so far this year, says Michael Currie, vice-president and investment adviser at TD Wealth. ""It doesn't seem like it, just the way people are talking, but if you actually look at the numbers, year-to-date numbers on the markets are pretty darn strong,"" he said in an interview. The TSX was up 1.7 per cent in the quarter and 16.3 per cent in the first nine months of the year. On Monday, the health-care sector fell 2.1 per cent as shares of Aurora Cannabis Inc. dropped 4.9 per cent and Canopy Growth Corp. was down 3.8 per cent. It followed a U.S. recommendation that consumers should avoid vaping products containing marijuana. That came ahead of legalization of these products in Canada next month. The materials sector was also lower as precious metals prices decreased, with gold dropping to its lowest level since early August, thus posting its first monthly decline in five months on an easing in geopolitical tensions. ""Any time we hear about more tension in the trade war that's usually good for gold so since that's kind of off today, that's pushed gold down 1.8 per cent,"" said Currie.
