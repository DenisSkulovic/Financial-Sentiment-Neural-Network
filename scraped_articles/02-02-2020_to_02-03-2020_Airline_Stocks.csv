Aimmune Therapeutics (AIMT) – The drugmaker received Food and Drug Administration approval for the first-ever treatment for peanut allergies. Check Point Software (CHKP) – Check Point reported quarterly profit of $2.02 per share, 3 cents a share above estimates. The cybersecurity company’s revenue also beat Street forecasts, boosted by an increase in subscriptions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 143.78 points higher, or 0.5%, at 28,399.81. The S&P 500 gained 0.7% to end the day at 3,248.92 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3% at 9,273.40. Nike led the Dow higher with a 3.1% rise after analysts at UBS and JPMorgan recommended buying the stock on coronavirus-related weakness. JPMorgan called this recent pullback a “multi-year buying opportunity.” Tesla, meanwhile, jumped more than 19% to record levels after an Argus Research analyst hiked his price target on the stock to $808 per share.  The major averages reached their session highs after the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing gauge showed activity in the sector expanded. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a contraction in manufacturing activity for January.  The 30-stock Dow was up more than 350 points at its high of the day.

3,What the Stock Market May Be Missing About the Coronavirus  - WSJ,"What the Stock Market May Be Missing About the Coronavirus. So far the impact on U.S. assets has been muted,"," It took investors a few days, but they think they have the effect of the new coronavirus from China worked out. The broad thrust: Suppliers to China, and travel and holiday stocks, will suffer, but nasty effects for the market as a whole will be offset by central banks. The virus will be controlled enough that it won’t cause a recession in the West. Leaving aside the heartbreak experienced by relatives and friends of those with the illness, as well as the many deaths, this coldblooded analysis rests on several assumptions that may turn out to be unsound—notably, the big risk that this virus could follow a different pattern than the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the financial effects of which are being widely used as a model. The new coronavirus has spread rapidly in China since emerging in Wuhan in December. So far its spread outside China has been limited, with around 100 cases and, so far, not much human-to-human infection—although the U.S. State Department is concerned enough to warn against all travel to China. Investors have reacted in what looks like a rational way: Since human-to-human infection was confirmed on Jan. 20, the biggest China exchange-traded fund, iShares MSCI China ETF, is down 11%; the U.S. airline sector is off 7%; and Brent crude oil, the global benchmark for the main transport fuel, is down 13%. Stocks in China-dependent Taiwan and South Korea have lost 6% and 9%, respectively, in dollar terms, while the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 is down only 3%. Bond yields are significantly lower, and investors are pricing in a 60% chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut by June—compared with just 15% before human-transmission confirmation. Those lower yields are once again cushioning the impact on U.S. stocks, following the lesson of the past decade that equities thrive when money is cheap.","Feb 2, 2020",https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-stock-market-may-be-missing-about-the-coronavirus-11580648400

Airlines will be hit hard by coronavirus. More from Graphic detail. The biggest story ever?
Only the","The history of past pandemics augurs badly for the travel industry STOCKMARKETS IN China fell by nearly 8% on February 3rd—the largest single-day fall since 2015—as fears about the economic impact of the Wuhan coronavirus increased. Of the industries affected by the epidemic, perhaps none will be hit as hard as travel. In recent weeks, hotel occupancy in China has fallen by 45% year-on-year, according to analysts at Citigroup, a bank. Shares in China’s three biggest airlines—Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines—have fallen by more than 20% since the first person died from the new strain, known as 2019-nCoV, on January 9th. The death toll in China has risen to 361. And the first death from the strain has been reported abroad, in the Philippines. Investors in Chinese aviation are right to be nervous. Some previous pandemics have caused huge drops in airline traffic. From peak to trough, Asian airlines’ monthly passenger numbers dropped by 35% after the SARS outbreak in 2003; for Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flag carrier, traffic fell by nearly 80%. The impact on some airlines of the Ebola outbreak, which started in West Africa in 2014, was still more severe. International air-passenger arrivals in Sierra Leone, for instance, plunged by 93%.

8,3 Airline Stocks to Sell Now,. . 3 Airline Stocks to Sell Now. MOST READ THIS WEEK. RECENT ARTICLES. 30 Days of MarketBeat All Access,"  Investing in airline stocks is not for the risk-averse even in the best of times. Coming out of 2019, some airline stocks were looking to be good buys. Strong earnings, an apparent breakthrough in the trade dispute with China, and apparent clarity on when Boeing (NYSE:BA) would be clear to start delivering its beleaguered 737 Max  planes, were all reasons for investor optimism. But this is a sector known to be more at risk than most to “black swan” events. And for many airlines, 2020 is becoming a year they would already like to forget. First, the industry has come to realize that the issues involving Boeing’s 737 Max are far from resolved. And while nobody in the industry is suggesting that safety should not be paramount, the airlines are relying on this inventory. The second event has been the outbreak of the coronavirus has caused many airlines to cancel all flights to China. It’s important to note that this is different than a belief that travelers may decide not to fly. This is an actual cancellation of flights, and the revenue that comes with them. For an economy that is heavily interdependent on China, it’s only natural that some investors are looking to sell. Here are three stocks that look to be at a particular risk during this turbulent time. United Airlines (UAL) The good news for United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) is that the company has less exposure to Boeing 737 Max jets than some other competitors. And, because the company, has those jets stored in Phoenix, Ariz., the mild weather may make it easier for UAL to get the planes ready for service once Boeing receives regulatory approval. The bad news is the airline is one of the most reliant on Asia. And that means the cancellation of flights to China may affect the airline more than others. Case in point, on January 17, UAL Stock was trading at approximately $90 per share. As of this writing on February 3, the stock is trading just below $76 per share. And the ugly comes from the company’s own balance sheet that shows United is projecting zero earnings growth for 2020. Plus, capital expenditures (CapEx) may increase by as much as $2 billion which will impact the company’s free cash flow (FCF). Southwest Airlines (LUV) Although Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has a clean balance sheet, it has more exposure","Feb 3, 2020",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/3-airline-stock-to-sell-now/

BTC-USD.,"                                                   By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued rules on Sunday to implement new restrictions on Americans who have recently visited China to address the threat of the coronavirus. Airline officials said Sunday the new rules will mean they must now ask all U.S.-bound passengers if they have visited mainland China. Airlines are expected to scrutinize passports of travelers, and warned the new rules could require passengers to arrive even earlier for U.S.-bound flights. American Airlines Inc said Sunday it encouraged U.S.-bound passengers ""to arrive at the airport three hours early as we expect this additional screening will lengthen the normal check-in process."" The United States said Friday that for flights departing after 5 p.m. EST Sunday, it will bar entry to nearly all foreign visitors who have been in China within the last two weeks. The Trump administration is limiting flights from China and for Americans who have visited China within the last 14 days to eight major U.S. airports for enhanced screening: New York's JFK, Chicago's O'Hare, San Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Dulles in Washington, DC. Three more airports - Newark, Dallas/Fort Worth and Detroit - would be added on Monday, DHS announced on Sunday. The new rules do not impact cargo-only flights, DHS said. American Airlines temporarily halted all flights to mainland China on Friday, while Delta Air Lines said Sunday its last flight had departed China before it planned resumption of flights in May. United Airlines is scheduled to continue China flights through Wednesday before halting flights through March 27. Many other nations are imposing similar restrictions. Airlines must ensure foreign visitors arriving in the United States have not visited China within the last two weeks and Americans who traveled within the last 14 days to China are flying to one of the seven designated airports.

14,Tourism-linked stocks hit hard by Wuhan virus | The Edge Markets,. . TRENDING NOW. Tourism-linked stocks hit hard by Wuhan virus. Subscribe to Mid-day email alert. FEATURED VIDEOS,"        KUALA LUMPUR: To say Malaysia’s much anticipated Visit Malaysia Year 2020 (VMY2020) is not off to a good start is probably an understatement, what with the severe blow dealt to the tourism industry by the Wuhan virus, now a global health emergency that has caused the death of over 300 and infected over 14,000 worldwide since the start of the outbreak at end-December. And there is no sign, so far, that the infection is abating. Tourism-related stocks, especially aviation, have been bearing the brunt of fear-stoked selling since the outbreak. As of last Friday, AirAsia Group Bhd’s stock price has plummeted 15.9% to RM1.43 apiece from Dec 31, erasing more than RM900 million of its market capitalisation in just one month. In the same period, its sister company, AirAsia X Bhd, lost 18.8% of its market value to close at 13 sen apiece last Friday, while airport operator Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd’s (MAHB) stock price fell 12.7% to RM6.74. Most major airlines have cancelled their routes to the outbreak’s epicentre of Wuhan — including AirAsia — and the Malaysian government is reportedly considering blocking all flights originating from China, raising more concerns about the possibility of achieving its VMY2020 targets of 30 million tourists and RM100 billion receipts. “This is not a good start to VMY2020. With the Wuhan virus outbreak, the targets set under VMY2020 seem to be at risk. Although the cases are mostly (99%) in China, the incident would nonetheless be a detriment to overall tourist arrivals as people turn cautious on travelling. “Tourism-related sectors that we expect to be negatively impacted by the virus outbreak are aviation (lower air travel demand), gaming (fewer tourists to casinos and hotels), and potentially consumers (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] experience saw a sequential decline in sentiment and private consumption),” Hong Leong Investment Bank analysts wrote in a note. Gaming counters Genting Bhd and Genting Malaysia Bhd (GenM) have fallen 8% to 10% in the one month since the outbreak. Those in the hospitality and retail landscape are not spared from the market selldown either — Shangri-La Hotels (Malaysia) Bhd and YTL Hospitality REIT have lost about 6.9% and 2.2%, respectively.

AirAsia dropped 10.5 per cent or 15 sen lower at RM1.28, with 57.67 million shares traded. Its market capitalisation shrank by RM500 million to RM4.28 billion. AirAsia X closed 7.7 per cent lower at 12 sen yesterday against Friday’s closing of 13 sen, with 32.98 million shares traded. Its market capitalisation declined by RM41.5 million to RM497.8 million. Last week, two unnamed executives of AirAsia and AirAsia X were reportedly implicated in bribery allegations against Airbus SE in relation to the airlines’ jet deals. According to Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO), Airbus had paid a US$50 million sponsorship for a sports team that was jointly owned by the two executives but was legally unrelated to AirAsia and AirAsia X. SFO said the payments that were the subject to the agreed wrongdoing included US$10 million on Oct 25, 2013; US$10 million (Nov 4, 2013); US$15 million (Dec 16, 2013); and US$15 million (Jan 9, 2015). Airbus allegedly had also offered an additional US$55 million but no payment was made. SFO described the duo - AirAsia executive 1 and AirAsia executive 2 – as key decision makers in AirAsia and AirAsia X as well as substantial shareholders of the airlines. SFO said the indictment was related to AirAsia and AirAsia X order of 180 aircraft from the European aircraft manufacturer between October 2005 and November 2014, allegedly secured by way of improper payments and offer of further improper payment. The contracts that were the subject of the agreed wrongdoing involved 64 units of A320neo with a purchase agreement on Dec 13, 2012; 36 units of A320ceo (Dec 13, 2012); 25 units of A330-300 (Dec 18, 2013); and 55 units of A330-900neo (Nov 24, 2014), according to SFO. Malaysian authorities, including the Malaysian Anti-Corrruption Commission (MACC) and Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom), are undertaking their own investigations on the allegations. Industry sources said the impact on AirAsia group and the duo in particular, could be more severe if the Malaysian anti-graft agency charged them. The repercussion could force the two executives to relinquish their positions in the low-cost carriers and their subsidiaries. “If the duo are found guilty and MACC charges them, it would be detrimental to the airlines’ future growth,”","Feb 3, 2020",https://www.nst.com.my/business/2020/02/562428/airasia-group-airasia-x-shares-plunge-amid-airbus-bribery-scandal
18,"Economic Impacts of China's Coronavirus Worse Than SARS, Could Slow Growth",. . . . . REPORT. Knock-On Effects of China’s Coronavirus May Be Worse Than Thought. China’s economy is bigger,"      As Chinese markets opened Monday, the effects of the mushrooming coronavirus outbreak hit with dramatic force. Within minutes, trading was suspended on multiple stocks as they hit the daily 10 percent limit that Chinese law allows—almost all downhill. China’s heavily controlled stock market is a relatively unimportant cog in its economy, but the next few months are likely to prove painful to an economy still reeling from its slowest growth in three decades and a prolonged trade war with the United States as the effects of a virus that has now reached nearly 20,000 confirmed infections continue to make themselves known. The knock-on effects of the virus and China’s dramatic response are daily making themselves felt, from disrupted air travel to rattled supply chains and plummeting commodity prices that are dampening growth prospects from Southeast Asia to South America and beyond. Monday was nominally the country’s first day back at work after the Lunar New Year holiday, normally a week long but which was already extended for three days to avoid the travel rush that usually accompanies the start and end of the festival. Almost all of the country save Xinjiang, however, is still on an uneasy vacation until at least Feb. 9, and schools and universities are likely to stay suspended even longer. Many prominent chains, from Apple to the hotpot giant Haidilao, have closed their doors until further notice. Even in municipalities that are nominally back at work, such as Beijing, the streets and subways remain eerily empty. Economists and analysts still caution that the full economic fallout depends on how well China can ultimately contain the outbreak and on whether the return to work—especially for migrant laborers, who make up a substantial part of China’s manufacturing workforce—can be managed smoothly. But most expect Chinese growth in the first quarter of the year to slide sharply, before rebounding later in the year to finish not much worse than the 6 percent increase in GDP China posted last year. Within China, the outbreak and the government’s response—essentially firewalling off nearly 100 million people in central Hubei province, where the virus broke out—already have impacted a host of sectors, from hospitality and retail to airlines, insurance, and manufacturing. Numerous cities and towns have implemented their own quarantine measures. Among the most restrictive are those in Wenzhou, the city worst hit by the virus outside","Feb 3, 2020",https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/03/knock-on-effects-china-coronavirus-weak-economy-markets/
