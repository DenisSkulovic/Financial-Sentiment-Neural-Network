Several airline stocks posted spectacular gains last week, but despite some","   Airlines have been among the hardest-hit businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. For much of the spring, nearly all states were requiring people to stay home except for essential activities.

The resulting plunge in air travel demand caused airlines to begin hemorrhaging cash.

5,UAL Stock Will Eventually Recover But Fear Reigns for Now | InvestorPlace,"For United Airlines, Less Bad Is the New Good. The worst may be over for UAL stock but that doesn’t"," United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) has had a recent run of “less bad” news. The airline is announcing it is seeing a reduction in cancellation rates. They are also seeing “moderate improvement” in demand, even regarding international travel. And UAL stock is up over 34% in the last five trading days as of this writing. However, for United Airlines, and other airlines, less bad is the new good. United is still saying it is forecasting a 75% year-over-year reduction in July capacity. As the U.S. economy begins a tentative, phased-in reopening, the airlines will begin to fly again. And that may get you thinking it is a good time to jump in on airline stocks such as United Airlines. I think the long-term outlook for UAL stock is good. But there still doesn’t seem like there’s a reason to jump in right now. If you look at 2008 and 2009, the depth of the financial crisis, UAL stock was trading below $10. In fact, for much of the time, it would have been considered a penny stock. However, investors who were willing to buy shares of United Airlines at that time and hold them until today, would still be holding onto an impressive gain of over 690%. That’s right. On July 2, 2009, shares of UAL were trading at $3.31. An investor that purchased 100 shares for $331 would “still” have $2,618. Of course, if that same investor was prescient enough to sell shares on Valentine’s Day, they would have had pocketed a gain of over $7,500. So, the question investors need to ask is whether or not you believe that the worst may be over for United Airlines? It certainly seems like it may be. The airline itself is saying that it is noticing fewer cancellations. But as my InvestorPlace colleague Thomas Niel wrote recently, you can afford to wait on UAL stock. It’s probably not going anywhere anytime soon. The purpose of this overly simplistic example is to emphasize that historical perspective is important. Airline stocks are volatile because at their core, they are responsible for transporting human beings from point A to point B. And that seems simple enough until you think about it. I love to fly. I don’t mean it’s always comfortable or convenient. But it still fills me with a bit of wonder and awe that I can wake up at home in my bed","May 24, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/05/for-ual-stock-less-bad-is-new-good/

7,Air Canada (TSX:AC): Are the Sky-High Rewards Worth the Risk? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Air Canada (TSX:AC): Are the Sky-High Rewards Worth the Risk?. Airline stocks:,"      Joey Frenette | May 25, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) and the broader airline industry are navigating through arguably the worst environment they’ve ever been in. While Air Canada may be a far more resilient company than it was prior to the 2007-08 Financial Crisis, it sure doesn’t feel like it given that the airlines are at ground zero of this coronavirus crisis. If the cause of this recession was anything other than a pandemic, I’m sure Air Canada would have pulled through on its own. The business of the airlines is now far more economical this time around, and Air Canada has done an exceptional job of improving upon its company-specific fundamentals. Unfortunately, none of this progress matters in the coronavirus era. Government-mandated travel restrictions put the airlines at the mercy of exogenous events, and for investors like Warren Buffett, the uncertainties that accompany an airline investment are far too high. Heck, you could argue that the coronavirus-related uncertainties have turned the airlines from a sound, profitable investment into a complete speculation. For long-term investors seeking to nab stocks at discounts to their intrinsic value, the airlines are becoming unworthy bets, as it’s virtually impossible to gauge their intrinsic value with the headwinds that lie ahead. The true value of the airlines ultimately depends on what’s going to happen next with this horrific pandemic and the vaccine timeline. Acknowledge the uncertainties the fact that you’ll be speculating and not investing in what’s shaping up to be an all-or-nothing type of bet. Until a working vaccine is created, it’s highly unlikely that the passenger volumes will make an abrupt return to pre-pandemic levels, even if travel restrictions are lifted as the risk of contracting COVID-19 is reduced. Boeing CEO David Calhoun noted that he sees it taking two or three years for air travel to recover and that the odds of a U.S. airline going under in 2020 are quite high. If a COVID-19 vaccine takes far longer than anyone on the Street is expecting, though, the road to recovery for the airline industry could be even longer. Who knows? It could take the airlines a full decade to turn to their 2019 heights if a worst-case scenario ends up unfolding, and the pandemic lasts as long, if not longer, than the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic. In such a scenario, investors","May 25, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/05/25/air-canada-tsxac-are-the-sky-high-rewards-worth-the-risk/
8,If You Must Buy Air Canada (TSX:AC) Follow This Important Strategy - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . If You Must Buy Air Canada (TSX:AC) Follow This Important Strategy. Take,"      Nelson Smith | May 25, 2020 | More on: AC Thousands of investors are crowding into Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock, despite the company offering major risks. The logic is simple, which concerns me a little bit. These folks are convinced the government won’t let Canada’s national airline go to zero. They say Justin Trudeau and his ruling Liberal Party will do whatever it takes to protect jobs and ensure Canada has a viable national airline. I don’t disagree with that assessment. Air Canada’s survival is important to the country. But that doesn’t mean investors will be made whole in such a scenario. A structured bankruptcy where debt holders become shareholders would rid the enterprise of its debt, allowing it to emerge as a leaner operation. Staff would keep their jobs and the company could pass on savings to customers in an attempt to jump start the entire travel industry again. Sounds like a win for everyone — except common shareholders. That’s why shares stubbornly won’t rise above the $15-$20 range. The smart investors are acknowledging the bankruptcy risk is very real, which is keeping shares depressed. Still, I’m the first to admit that Air Canada represents a compelling risk/reward opportunity. Air Canada shares trade at $16.41 each as I type this. It was a $50 stock before COVID-19 crushed the sector. If the stock can simply go back to those highs, it represents a 200% return on investment. It’s enough to turn a $10,000 stake into something worth $30,000 — and the stock would also have potential to go higher over the long-term, too. I suggest investors take a somewhat different approach to the sector. Rather than just buying Air Canada shares, investors should do this instead. The same story is playing out around the world. Major airlines are struggling and governments are stepping in to help. Most governments are giving these airlines sweetheart loans, which should be enough to ensure these companies can get through today’s lean times. The main issue is what happens tomorrow. Whether it’s Air Canada or another major carrier, the story is the same. We need travel to bounce back relatively quickly for airlines to survive in their current form. If it doesn’t, we’ll be back in the same situation in a year or two. Will bailouts happen again? One way investors can effectively minimize much of the risk","May 25, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/05/25/if-you-must-buy-air-canada-tsxac-follow-this-important-strategy/

Purchase of Vueling, and"," International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A., usually shortened to IAG, is an Anglo-Spanish multinational airline holding company with its registered office in Madrid, Spain, and its operational headquarters in London, England. It was formed in January 2011 after a merger agreement between British Airways and Iberia, the flag carriers of the UK and Spain respectively, when British Airways and Iberia became 100% owned subsidiaries of IAG. Because British Airways was the larger company, its shareholders were given 55% of the shares in the new, merged company.[4][5][6][7] Since its creation, IAG has expanded its portfolio of operations and brands by purchasing other airlines - BMI (2011), Vueling (2012), Aer Lingus (2015) and Air Europa (expected to be completed in 2020). The Group also owns the Level brand and Avios, the IAG rewards programme. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Madrid Stock Exchange. It is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and IBEX 35 Index. British Airways and Iberia signed a preliminary merger agreement in November 2009.[8][9][10] In April 2010, British Airways and Iberia signed a full merger agreement, with an intended completion date of late 2010, subject to securing the necessary regulatory approvals.[11][12] The merger between British Airways and Iberia was completed on 21 January 2011, and shares in the new holding company IAG began trading in London and Madrid on 24 January.[13][14][15] On 6 October 2011, IAG created Iberia Express, a new low-cost airline to operate short- and medium-haul routes from IAG's Madrid hub and provide transfer feed onto Iberia's longhaul network.[16][17] Iberia Express began operations on 25 March 2012.[18][19] On 4 November 2011, IAG agreed in principle to acquire British Midland International (BMI) from Lufthansa, in a deal which would increase IAG's share of slots at Heathrow airport from 45% to 54%.[20][21] On 22 December 2011, IAG agreed a binding deal with Lufthansa to acquire BMI for £172.5 million.[22] On 30 March 2012, the purchase was approved, subject to the condition that the combined group divest itself of 12 daily slots and lease two daily slots at Heathrow airport. The acquisition was completed on 20 April 2012, and the BMI fleet and routes were integrated into the British Airways schedule throughout 2012.[23] On 8 November 2012 IAG made a cash tender offer to buy Vueling, a Spanish low-cost airline based in Barcelona.

The aid package involves taking an initial 20 per cent stake that could rise to 25 per cent plus one share in the event of a hostile takeover, according to a statement on Monday. The plan, which requires European Union approval and will almost certainly be challenged by rival airlines such as Ryanair Holdings Plc, gives German officials an effective veto over company strategy. While Lufthansa’s management board accepted the offer, the company’s supervisory board will debate and vote on the package before asking shareholders to do the same at an extraordinary general meeting. Europe’s largest airline last week warned that it required “urgent” assistance after the fallout from the coronavirus grounded most of its fleet.

The stock market’s flimsy rally is going to come crashing down according to 72% of similar markets in the past. By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. The debate over whether or not the U.S. stock market will be able to continue with its impressive rally raged on last week. Bulls rejoiced with positive vaccine news and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s promise to do what it takes to support the U.S. economy. But some analysts are sounding the alarm that a stock market selloff is coming. One such bear is Sundial Capital Research analyst Jason Goepfert. He says history tells us there’s a good chance the market is about to move lower— a 72% chance to be exact.  He pointed out that this marks the 30th time the S&P 500 has been trapped between its 50-day moving average (roughly 2730) and its 200-day moving average (3000) for more than 20 days in a row. When that’s happened in the past, the index almost always goes lower. Even if the S&P 500 bucks the trend and breaks above the 200-day moving average, it typically offers up an average decline of 12.7%  over the next six months. The trouble is basically that buyers haven’t shown enough oomph to make any progress lately.

Pakistan,"File photo of a Pakistan International Airlines flight. A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane with around 107 passengers and crew onboard crashed on Friday in a densely-populated residential area just outside the Karachi Airport with many feared dead. Flight PK-8303 from Lahore was about to land in Karachi when it crashed at the Jinnah Garden area near Model Colony in Malir, just a minute before its landing. The preliminary report suggested that the landing gear failed on approach to the runway due to technical error. The pilot attempted a belly landing, and in the process, the engine got scrapped at least three times and pilot couldn't land the plane. He attempted another belly landing, during which the engine failed and plane crashed. It is been learned now that the AP-BLD is a 15-year-old Airbus A320-200, leased from GECAS by PIA since October 2014. As per Simply Flying the plane was previously operated by China Eastern Airlines for 10 years, since its manufacture in 2004. By Friday evening, the bodies of 41 people had been recovered, said the airline's chief executive Arshad Mahmood Malik in a press conference, adding the full clearance operation could last two to three days. He said only one survivor had been confirmed from the wreckage -- the president of the Bank of Punjab, Zafar Masud. However, provincial officials reported at least two survivors, and said at least 60 dead bodies had been recovered. Faisal Edhi, who heads the charitable Edhi foundation that was assisting rescuers, said 45 bodies have been recovered so far. ""Our rescue workers have taken out 45 bodies from the remains of the aircraft,"" he said. Edhi said around 25 to 30 residents whose houses were damaged by the plane have also been taken to the hospital, mostly with burn wounds. The aircraft wings during the crash landing hit the houses in the residential colony before crashing down. ""At least 25 houses have been damaged in this incident,"" Edhi said. Sindh Health Minister Azra Pechuho said 19 bodies have been shifted from the crash site to Jinnah hospital and another 20 to Civil hospital. Scores of injured were also rushed to hospitals. ""The first priority is to rescue the people. The main hurdle is narrow streets and presence of ordinary people who gathered at the place after the crash but they have been dispersed,"" said Pechuho.","May 25, 2020",https://www.news18.com/news/auto/pia-crashed-flight-was-a-15-year-old-airbus-320-bought-from-china-eastern-airlines-5-yrs-ago-2634189.html
