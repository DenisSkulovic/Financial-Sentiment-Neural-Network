CNBC Newsletters,"Travel earnings are on deck this week, and it could give insight into how large an economic impact the coronavirus outbreak might have on the industry. Hilton Worldwide, which reported Tuesday morning, issued solid guidance but said the effect of the coronavirus was still unknown. TripAdvisor, Expedia and MGM could offer a better outlook when they report later this week. Watch out for one of those, says Mark Newton, founder of Newton Advisors. “TripAdvisor, in particular, has been a real laggard. It is fairly bearish technically just in the month of December,” Newton said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “The stock moved down to the lowest monthly close we’ve seen since 2011 so it’s been in a pretty persistent downtrend.”  “It shows very little evidence thus far of any stabilization,” said Newton. “I think it’s a good likelihood it pulls back into the mid- to low-$20s in the weeks and months to come. So that’d be one specifically I would avoid.” TripAdvisor moved 3.5% higher Tuesday, trading at around $29.65. It reports earnings Wednesday afternoon. Quint Tatro, president of Joule Financial, said the entire group looks dangerous with the full economic damage of the coronavirus still a question mark. “I think that investors have to be very careful. There’s a big allure any time you have some kind of headline risk like this to venture in and say ‘oh, these stocks are cheap here, look at these on a fundamental basis etc. etc.,’” Tatro said during the same segment. “When something like this happens that we have absolutely no idea how the future will play out, they just become no-touch for us.” Tatro added that the airline stocks could be ones to consider once uncertainty lifts. United Airlines, Southwest, JetBlue, Delta and American Airlines were all higher Tuesday. Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

1,Who Has Been Buying American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Shares? - Simply Wall St News,Who Has Been Buying American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Shares?. What Is Insider Buying?. The Last 12 Months Of Insider,"We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL). Most investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information. We don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year. Check out our latest analysis for American Airlines Group Chairman & CEO William Parker made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.4m worth of shares at a price of US$28.09 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$28.79. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices. Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 126.50k shares worth US$3.6m. But insiders sold 6930 shares worth US$202k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by American Airlines Group insiders. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying. I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests.","Feb 11, 2020",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group/news/who-has-been-buying-american-airlines-group-inc-nasdaqaal-shares-2
2,"U.S. Based Budget Airline, Breeze Airways Announced - Air Market Group","U.S. Based Budget Airline, Breeze Airways Announced. Making Flying to Smaller Regional Airports Easier. David Neeleman, Aviation Entrepreneuer. Starting with","Air Market Group  The Regional airports in the United States have had a tough run over the last few years. The aviation industry has been rapidly changing dramatically over the last 20 years. We have seen growth from the Major Airlines as they expand their routes to international destinations and provide code-share agreements with airlines in other countries making it easier for travelers to make it across the world. With the expansion of long range, wide body aircraft the attention has been taken away from many small regional airports. These airports in the United States serve a great portion of the population that do not live near a large major airport. For some individuals the regional airports near their area do not provide routes that allow them to arrive to their final destination. These travelers are forced to then travel to a larger hub airport to then connect on another aircraft to finally reach to their destination. And if the time between the two flights is hours away then the individual would have wasted time waiting for the connection that the time that would have been saved with a direct route. Breeze Airways the newest airline to have been announced is stating to provide to those airports that have been underserved over the last few years. The airline has been in development for quite some time and with the official release of the name and potential livery projections are that we may see flights starting by the end of the year, all dependent on the approval of the FAA. On February 7th, 2020 David Neeleman Announced the official name of the new airline which will be the 5th airline that David has Started. David Neeleman has shown his ability to begin and develop airlines at a rapid rate. Morris Air was started in Utah by David and the routes and fleet were sold to Southwest who has allowed them to develop to where the are today. Canada’s Westjet took on competing with Air Canada and has put up quite the fight. They have been able to develop a large fan base with their ability to provide incredible service to their domestic and international destinations. JetBlue which started in the year 2000 has developed to over 100 routes. Their presence throughout the east coast has allowed them to create a profitable business within their early years of operation.

3,"Moxy renamed Breeze Airways, eyes launch by 2021","Moxy renamed Breeze Airways, eyes launch by 2021. World’s nicest airline in the making?. Who is behind Breeze Airways?. World","Moxy Airlines, a start-up airline by the same founder as JetBlue (JBLU) , has changed name to Breeze Airways. The carrier is still awaiting the green light by regulators to launch operations,  with hopes to take off by the end of 2020.  Breeze Airways management is currently working to obtain the Air Operator’s Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration and US Department of Transportation. If everything goes according to the plan, it could be up and running by the end of the year.  Breeze Airways is looking to use the U.S. airlines’ consolidation and hub models to their advantage, as the newcomer would be flying mid-sized U.S. city pairs that currently have no nonstop service.  Ever since United Airlines’ infamous “David Doe being dragged out of aplane” incident, the airline, as well as other U.S. legacy carriers, have been battling their bad reputation for customer service. Breeze sees another opportunity here, stating their future employees would be hired according to their “commitment to customer service and kindness”. “Breeze will fly non-stop service between places currently without meaningful or affordable service,” Neeleman is cited in the company’s statement as saying.  “20 years ago, we brought humanity back to the airline industry with JetBlue (JBLU) . Today, we’re excited to introduce plans for ‘the World’s Nicest Airline’.” During Farnborough International Airshow 2018, Moxy placed an order for 60 Airbus A220 jets, deliveries expected to start from 2021. The hype surrounding Breeze Airways has less to do with its business plan and much more with the founder. The airline to-be is the fifth airline started by David Neeleman.  Neeleman, a Brazilian-American entrepreneur, is, among others, the founder of the U.S. low-cost carrier JetBlue (JBLU) . The airline, which began operations in 2000, is now the sixth biggest in the United States and approximately seventh biggest in the continent by passenger numbers. In 2019, it carried over 42 million passengers.  Besides JetBlue (JBLU) , Neeleman is also a founder of WestJet, Azul Brazilian Airlines and Morris Air. WestJet, a Canadian low-cost carrier, is currently the second biggest airline in the country and the 9th in North America by passenger numbers. Azul Brazilian Airlines, in turn, is the 4th largest airline in South America.  While Morris Air is the only Neeleman’s creation which is not operating anymore, that does not mean that the airline was unsuccessful.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT James Kynge Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story The Sars outbreak of 2003 taught Asian investors that when the disease passes, there are profits to be made. So for many, the coronavirus scourge is seen as cause to reposition funds in expectation of a rebound. But which sectors and stocks can be expected to come back the strongest? There are some obvious candidates: the share prices of airlines, restaurant chains and businesses that require people to be in proximity have been hit particularly hard as cities and factories have been shut down. If the Sars epidemic is any guide, the valuations of companies in these sectors should bounce back once the crisis is over. Cathay Pacific’s share price, for example, nearly doubled between its 2003 nadir and its peak in mid-2004 — by which time most people were confident that the virus had been beaten. But other industries are much harder to call. One approach is to look at those that were showing signs of a cyclical rebound just before the crisis hit and back them to resume it once the coronavirus — which has killed more than 1,000 people — loses its vigour. Semiconductor manufacturers in Asia are one such sector, according to Steven Holden, founder of Copley Fund Research, which tracks the investment decisions of 223 emerging market funds with a combined $450bn under management. Mr Holden’s data show that these funds had built up record overweight holdings in semiconductor stocks by the end of 2019. On average they had 7.33 per cent of their total holdings in such stocks on December 31, about three weeks before the extent of the epidemic became clear. Following the news of virus’s impact, their average position slipped back to 7.15 per cent of total holdings but remained at a strong 0.91 percentage point overweight relative to the MSCI emerging markets benchmark index. The most strongly bought chip companies were SK Hynix, the South Korean memory chip supplier, and three from Taiwan: TSMC, the semiconductor foundry; MediaTek, which supplies chips to wireless communications manufacturers; and Win Semiconductors, a foundry services company. “Emerging market managers are positioned at record overweight ranges in semiconductor stocks after a surge in buying activity over the six months to January,” Mr Holden said. “After an initial shock following the coronavirus outbreak, stocks such as TSMC and","Feb 11, 2020",https://www.ft.com/content/30c2f060-4cba-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5

Shaanxi Heavy Duty Automobile Co. Ltd., better known as Shacman Trucks outside China, is one of the largest truck manufacturers in China. Shaanxi consists of four truck companies, delivering over 150,000 new trucks worldwide each year, including 10,000 trucks per year for the mining sector. The company is also one of the leaders in China in the field of autonomous driving research and development. At the first stage of the project, InnovizPro LiDAR is being utilized in Shaanxi Truck's autonomous proof of concept project at the Chinese port, with Shaanxi's ultimate goal being the deployment of up to 600 trucks at this site. The Innoviz LiDAR used in this proof of concept project provides sensing, mapping and location functions for autonomous driving at speeds of under 30 kilometers per hour in the harbor area. The LiDAR is used to create detailed maps, as well as provide software to compare the point cloud image created by the LiDAR in real time to the location provided via preloaded maps generated by LiDAR. This includes real-time identification of ""free space"" or ""drivable space"", as well as object detection. One major task for the trucks is to enable autonomous loading and unloading of containers in the port area. After testing many potential LiDAR solutions, Shaanxi Trucks chose InnovizPro, a first-of-its-kind solid-state LiDAR sensor, due to the solution's reliability and price/performance advantages. Integration of location sensors such as retroreflectors is also possible in these geofenced areas, enhancing the ability of the LiDAR to fully understand its surroundings.

7,JetBlue founder starting new airline: Breeze - Chicago Tribune,JetBlue founder starting new airline: Breeze. . RECOMMENDED ON CHICAGO TRIBUNE. LATEST BUSINESS. MOST READ ON CHICAGO TRIBUNE. . .,"COTTONWOOD HEIGHTS, UTAH — The air travel entrepreneur who launched JetBlue 20 years ago is introducing a new air carrier. David Neeleman unveiled the official name of his fifth airline startup — Breeze Aviation — on Friday, the Deseret News reported. He previously launched Morris Air, WestJet, JetBlue and Azul. Southwest acquired Morris Air in 1993, while WestJet and Azul are top-five carriers in Canada and Brazil, respectively, officials said. “I never started an airline just to start an airline,” Neeleman said. “Right now, we see some pretty gaping holes in the industry.” Neeleman has not yet announced potential routes for the Utah-based carrier, but has said he plans to identify and leverage nonstop flights between currently underserved airports. Neeleman's approach is to prioritize a customer-centric system by taking methods from Uber and Amazon and launching an app-based toolkit that would allow passengers to find tickets, change or update travel plans, and add other travel necessities such as car rentals and accommodations, he said. “The goal is to have our customers ... never having to speak with anybody, if they don’t want to,” Neeleman said. “Add a car, add a hotel, cancel a flight, make changes, it will all be there at your fingertips. Completely hassle-free flying.” Breeze Aviation has leased 30 Embraer 195 aircraft from Azul that are expected to start flights in May, and ordered 60 new Airbus 220-300 aircraft that are expected to start flights in April 2021, company officials said. The Airbuses are suited for nonstop travel between midsize markets, while the Embraers can cost-effectively connect smaller markets, officials said. Breeze could earn more than $1 million in tax rebates on plans to make over $3 million in capital investments and hire about 370 employees, Neeleman said.

The dip could amount to as much as four percentage points, taking the Q1 growth rate to just 2% from the same 2019 quarter.

From owning as much as 45 million Facebook shares, early investor Peter Thiel now holds less than 10,000 after massive dump. By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. At the time of Facebook’s (NASDAQ:FB) IPO in 2012 early investor Peter Thiel owned 2.5% of the social media giant. Now he holds just 0.000004% of the company’s outstanding stock. This is after selling 53,602 FB shares last week, leaving him with a tiny stake of 9,948 shares. Based on Facebook’s closing price on Monday, Thiel’s remaining stake is worth a little over $2 million. At the time of Facebook’s IPO, Thiel held 44.7 million shares of the company. The stake would be worth nearly $10 billion if he hadn’t disposed of it over the years. Interestingly, Thiel’s move is coinciding with his former colleague at PayPal Elon Musk labelling Facebook “lame” while promoting the #DeleteFacebook campaign. Facebook currently has bigger problems than Elon Musk’s tweets. The 2020 U.S. general election presents a challenge to Facebook’s profits and growth. Last month, the social media giant reported that expenses had increased 51% year-on-year in 2019. This was primarily related to investments made in improving privacy and security on the platform. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that 2020 is going to be an “intense year.”   Already, controversy is brewing over Facebook’s political ad policies.

-0.07%. Air Italy will end operations and liquidate, becoming the latest airline to fail. SEE","  Less than two years after launching its first flight, Italian airline Air Italy announced on Tuesday that it would liquidate. The airline said it would continue to operate flights through February 25. Anyone with flights after that will receive a refund after requesting one from the airline. Passengers scheduled to travel before February 25 can also request a refund instead of traveling. Air Italy is the latest airline to collapse, following 2019's bankruptcies of Iceland-based Wow Air, British travel company Thomas Cook, Indian airline Jet Airways, and French budget carrier XL Airways. Air Italy was effectively a rebranding of legacy Italian regional carrier Meridiana, which was itself the product of mergers with several other small Italian carriers. Qatar Airways acquired a 49% stake in Meridiana in 2017, overhauling it and rebranding as a long-haul airline using a traditional hub-and-spoke model. The airline used Milan Malpensa airport as its hub, differing from Rome-based Alitalia, the Italian flag carrier. The airline reportedly lost 164 million euros in 2018 and 200 million euros in 2019, or $179 million and $218 million, respectively, at current exchange rates.  It had 20 737 Max aircraft in its fleet for regional connections out of Milan Malpensa, but those planes have been grounded since March 2019, forcing the airline to reconfigure its flight schedule. It leased Airbus A330 aircraft from Qatar for long-haul flights. Qatar could not increase its investment or inject cash into the airline as it struggled due to European Union laws, which limit foreign ownership of companies to a minority stake. Alitalia has also faced financial difficulties, relying on repeated rescue efforts from the Italian government. In a statement, Qatar Airways suggested that the airline's other owners were unwilling to continue operating at a loss: Since the acquisition on 28 September 2017 of a minority stake in Air Italy, Qatar Airways has strongly believed in the company and in its potential, supporting management's proposed business plan with a view to improving Air Italy's growth and job creation, with the addition of long-haul routes and numerous in-flight service improvements, in line with Qatar Airways' globally renowned high standards.

This is nothing,"February 11, 2020 7:30 PM GMT+2 Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook have collectively added $4.4 trillion in market cap gains since 2013 and are now the 5 largest stocks in the S&P 500.   This spectacular growth means these 5 companies alone now make up more than 18% of the S&P 500. This massive growth also means these companies now have an outsized impact on the performance of the market itself. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, these 5 tech stocks were responsible for more than 20% of the S&P 500's 31% return in 2019. When you see a handful of stocks dominate in such a way it can make some investors nervous. What happens to the stock market if these companies begin to sell off? Is the rest of the market participating in this rally or is it all being driven by just a small number of stocks? It's important to remember that concentration in stock market gains in the S&P 500 is a feature, not a bug. In a market-cap-weighted index, the majority of the gains will invariably come from the largest names. This doesn't mean smaller stocks aren't participating in the rally, just that they don't move the needle for the overall market. Market breadth is a way to gauge the number of stocks rising versus the number that are falling to understand how much of the market is participating in a rally or downturn. In the late-1990s dot-com bubble, there was a noticeable divergence between the stock market and the NYSE advance-decline line, which simply measures the ratio of the number of stocks rising over the number of stocks falling. The fact that the advance-decline line was crashing while the market kept rising was a good sign only a handful of big stocks were propping up the market. This was a good warning sign for the bear market that would follow. Now here's the same measure since 2013: There have been some minor divergences but for the most part the advance-decline line has tracked the upward move in the market. What this tells us is smaller and medium stocks are also rising. This one measure doesn't tell you exactly when to get in or get out but it can help us understand the underlying health of the stock market. The concentration at the top of the S&P 500 has been increasing in recent years","Feb 11, 2020",https://fortune.com/2020/02/11/s-and-p-500-stocks-microsoft-apple-amazon-google-facebook/

This story,"The science and secrets behind how in-flight meals are selected and prepared.  As Jerry Seinfeld famously asked, “What’s the deal with airplane food?” The Biscoff cookies you’re given as a participation prize for reaching cruising altitude and the warmed-up plastic container of pasta from your trans-Atlantic flight are shrouded in mystery. Most passengers don’t question where their complimentary food came from or how it got to them, despite how little information is given about the meal selection and preparation process. Would anyone stuck 35,000 feet up in the air turn down free food? Not me. The airline catering services industry is worth $6 billion in the United States, but there’s not much behind-the-scenes knowledge bestowed on the average traveler as to how the sausage gets made. In fact, I struggled to find sources willing to explain the ins and outs of airplane food. Two of the major catering companies, Gate Gourmet and Flying Food Group, declined to be interviewed for this story. While most major carriers have culinary design teams to brainstorm menus, they rely on catering companies to help them produce thousands of in-flight meals a day. Airplane food hasn’t always been served in a plastic-wrapped box that looks like it came straight from a Trader Joe’s aisle. As with everything related to modern air travel, meals and the logistics to prepare them are continually being fine-tuned to be more efficient and, ideally, to improve the customer experience. To recognize how meager today’s domestic food offerings are, we have to look to the late 1990s and early 2000s, when airlines served complimentary meals on domestic flights. Yes, even flights as short as Boston to Chicago. (This, of course, was incomparable to the 1950s and 1960s, which was dubbed the “golden age of air travel,” when multi-course meals and alcohol were served on board to economy fliers.) In the aftermath of 9/11, the industry took a devastating financial hit, and most airlines had to slash costs wherever necessary. One of the first things they cut back on was in-flight meal service. American Airlines completely stopped serving meals for economy passengers on domestic flights, with the exception of nonstop transcontinental routes. Delta and United wouldn’t serve economy meals on flights under four hours. (There were no changes to international flights.) An airline consultant presciently told the New York Times in 2001 that this appeared to be a permanent change.

18,Wuhan Evacuees Hunker Down for Weeks in Quarantine - WSJ,Wuhan Evacuees Hunker Down for Weeks in Quarantine. China’s shutdown of the city was unprecedented. So is the evacuation and," Tennessee resident David Mayes was in China visiting his girlfriend in Wuhan when officials locked down the city on Jan. 23, aiming to stop a rapidly spreading coronavirus that has killed hundreds there. Overnight, the city turned into a ghost town, Mr. Mayes said. Eight-lane highways were empty. Businesses were shuttered. But some Americans have made it out, on flights chartered by the U.S. State Department from an otherwise-closed airport. Mr. Mayes, a 59-year-old pilot, waited at the airport for 15 hours Tuesday as passengers were screened for fever. When they departed, he found out he was headed for a two-week quarantine on Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, a base near San Diego where he was stationed as a Navy lieutenant commander three decades ago. “I was coming home, almost, after 27 years,” he said. After landing and undergoing a health check, however, officials summoned Mr. Mayes. His persistent cough could be a symptom of coronavirus, they said. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he spent four days in isolation, watching Netflix and waiting for test results to tell him whether he has the virus. Sunday, his test results came back negative, Mr. Mayes said. He was headed back to the base for the rest of the quarantine period, where he said he was excited to walk around and see the other evacuees.","Feb 10, 2020",https://www.wsj.com/articles/wuhan-evacuees-hunker-down-for-weeks-in-quarantine-11581339984
