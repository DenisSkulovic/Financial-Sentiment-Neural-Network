0,3 Top Airline Stocks to Buy Now | The Motley Fool,3 Top Airline Stocks to Buy Now. Here's how to pick the high-flying stocks in an industry that has been,"   Historically, the airline industry has been a terrible destination for investors. Over a 20-year period beginning in the early 1980s, U.S. airlines were involved in more than four dozen bankruptcies, with shareholders taking the financial hit on nearly every occasion. But a lot has changed in recent years. The last round of restructurings completed in the late 2000s (and a series of acquisitions that followed) has created four strong companies that control nearly 80% of the domestic U.S. market and eliminated most of the irrational pricing that added to the volatility. Balance sheets are cleaner, labor contracts are more reasonable, and the prospect of major airlines flying through a recession is now brighter than ever. Still, not all airlines are created equal. Here's a look at how to pick a good airline stock investment and three top choices for putting new money to work today. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Airlines like to talk about brand loyalty and the strength of their frequent-flier products, but for the most part, they are offering a commoditized product. Most consumers want to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible for the lowest price, regardless of the logo on the outside of the aircraft. Few airlines are able to charge a substantial premium to the competition on a particular route. The airlines all operate fleets of similar Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus jets, though the mix of planes in the inventory can make it easier for some airlines to match capacity to demand and make sure their flights are filled. Larger airlines, in theory, should enjoy some economies of scale on plane purchases and maintenance, but most of the bigger carriers also operate a more complex fleet with numerous different types of aircraft that negates much of that potential advantage. There have been times when the aircraft you fly (or don't fly) can be a competitive advantage. For years, airlines that operated Boeing's 787 Dreamliner were able to price more aggressively than those that did not because of the plane's improved fuel economy. More recently, operators of Boeing's 737 MAX, which has been grounded for more than six months in 2019 due to software problems, have been at a competitive disadvantage to those who did not operate the plane.

When considering airlines, it is important to look at how they have positioned themselves in the","Sep 25, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/09/25/3-top-airline-stocks-to-buy-now.aspx
1,Delta and United: The Best Airline Stocks Right Now?,Delta and United: The Best Airline Stocks Right Now?. Delta’s and United’s impressive outlook. Delta stock benefits while other airlines,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) could be interesting choices for investors right now. Their strong back-to-back quarterly performance and outlook are impressive. Moreover, the two companies could continue benefiting from the domestic market’s strong corporate and leisure travel demand. Low unemployment and higher wages are driving US air passenger traffic. The stocks’ performance this year has diverged. Delta is one of the US airline industry’s top stocks, while United has lagged behind the broader market. Delta stock has returned 16.9% year-to-date, outperforming the Dow Jones and the iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT), which have gained 15.6% and 13.6%, respectively. United Airlines stock has returned just 6.5% this year. Delta and United both have a strong history of beating analysts’ earnings expectations. Delta has surpassed analysts’ earnings estimates in the last eight quarters. In the second quarter, its top and bottom lines beat Wall Street’s estimates and improved significantly YoY (year-over-year). The company’s focus on enhancing its non-ticket sources and premium products is supporting the growth. Delta had also raised its revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2019, to 6%–7% from 5%–7%. The company’s guidance is higher than Wall Street’s estimate of 5.6%. In the third quarter, Delta expects its adjusted EPS to grow 15%–31% to $2.10–$2.40. Analysts’ Q3 earnings forecast of $2.26 is almost at the midpoint of the company’s guidance. United Airlines has surpassed analysts’ earnings estimates in 13 of the last 14 quarters. In the second quarter, the company’s revenue and earnings improved YoY and beat analysts’ expectations. United expects to continue benefiting from adding more flights, managing costs efficiently, and investing in customer service. Therefore, it has raised its fiscal 2019 EPS guidance to $10.50–$12 from $10–$12. Analysts’ fiscal 2019 EPS estimate for United is $11.72. Delta’s non-exposure to Boeing’s (BA) troubled 737 MAX jets has made it attractive. The planes’ grounding, started in March, has caused thousands of flight cancellations for Southwest Airlines (LUV), American Airlines (AAL), and United Airlines. Together, the three companies own 72 Boeing 737 MAXs. Southwest and American have revealed that the MAX grounding cost them $175 million each in the second quarter. As Delta doesn’t own any MAXs, it’s been shielded from the grounding’s impact. Furthermore, the planes are expected to remain grounded until December, meaning Delta’s rivals could lose even more money. Meanwhile, Delta can continue with its global and capacity expansion plans.

2,"Rival travel stocks leaped after Thomas Cook's demise, but turbulence remains","Rival travel stocks leaped after Thomas Cook's demise, but turbulence remains. Quick gain eases long-term pain. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","European travel operators and airline stocks enjoyed an initial spike after the news emerged over the weekend that rival firm Thomas Cook had filed for bankruptcy. But while analysts agree that the demise of the world's oldest travel firm is an opportunity for rivals, a number of long term challenges continue to hang over the sector. The British stalwart's biggest like-for-like rival, TUI, saw its shares jump almost 10% on Monday morning and continued to climb into Tuesday, closing at 959.6 pence per share. However, it fell back by 6% on Wednesday, and there are further headwinds to consider. ""Life has been hard for TUI in recent years with the company suffering from certain aircraft being grounded, overcapacity in the airline sector and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on consumer spending,"" Russ Mould, investment director at U.K. brokerage AJ Bell, said in a note Tuesday. But he added that Thomas Cook's collapse would be ""Christmas come early"" for TUI, despite some short-term costs associated with repatriating Thomas Cook customers stranded overseas, and lost revenue from TUI holiday packages that used Thomas Cook flights. ""Short-term pains will almost certainly turn into long-term gains for TUI. It has a chance to mop up business that would have normally gone to Thomas Cook and to potentially convince some of its rival's customers to go for some of its more differentiated offerings rather than a bog-standard package holiday,"" Mould explained. ""For example, current trading shows how its holiday experiences continue to be the strong part of the business, such as husky sleigh tours in Lapland or a trip to Ferrari Land in Spain."" There is therefore a ""major chance"" for TUI, he added, but it will require some ""very smart marketing."" In its full-year trading update, TUI insisted its business model was proving ""resilient"" in challenging market conditions. However, it warned that Brexit uncertainty hitting demand and the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 8 airliner. The group sees full-year earnings falling by 26% and has issued two profit warnings so far this year. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the update proved that these are ""tough times in the travel industry"" but stressed that TUI's diversified business model and digital aspirations render it a ""different animal"" to its fallen rival.

CNBC Newsletters","Check out the companies making headlines after the bell: LATAM Airlines shares skyrocketed more than 47% after the bell following a CNBC report that Delta Airlines is planning to buy a 20% stake worth $1.9 billion in Latin America’s largest airline. Brazilian airline GOL’s shares, meanwhile, tanked nearly 11% after Delta said it would also exit its minority stake in GOL, which competes with LATAM in the region. Shares of Micron slid as much as 7.75% during extended trade after the company reported mixed first-quarter guidance, expecting adjusted earnings per share between 39 cents and 52 cents with revenue between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion. Analysts were expecting future quarterly earnings of 48 cents per share and revenue of $4.76 billion, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates. Micron’s shares slipped despite a strong fourth-quarter earnings beat, reporting earnings of 56 cents per share on revenue of $4.87 billion, while Wall Street had expected earnings of 49 cents per share on $4.57 billion in revenue. Micron also said that its sales to Huawei “were down meaningfully” from anticipated levels prior to Huawei being added to the U.S. Entity List, which effectively prevents the Shenzen-based company from doing business with American companies. Other chip-makers also saw their shares dip after the mixed quarterly guidance. Applied Materials, NVIDIA and Western Digital saw their shares slip 3.3%, 1.5% and 3% respectively. Vail Resorts shares jumped 3% after the company posted stronger than expected fourth-quarter earnings. The mountain resort company posted a $2.22 loss per share and revenue of $301 million, while Wall Street was expecting a $2.53 loss per share and revenue of $240 million, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates. Shares of Las Vegas Sands climbed 4.96% after an announcement that the casino and resort company will join the S&P 500, replacing Nektar Therapeutics. The biopharmaceutical company’s shares jumped 2.22% as the company replaces Sotheby’s in the S&P MidCap 400. Nektar’s shares are down approximately 47% year-to-date. Got a confidential news tip?

4,Why is the airline industry such a bad investment? - Quora,,"Several good answers here, but they don’t get to the crux of the problem. When an airline schedules a flight it is making a gamble: There will be enough demand for the flight such the flight will be profitable: ticket and other revenue minus costs (fuel, depreciation / lease / loan interest on the plane, crew salaries, airport fees, etc) = profit. Now in other businesses if a product is not profitable you can just stop selling it. A grocery store puts a new brand of jam on the shelf. If it doesn’t sell, it stops selling it and can return the unsold stock to the manufacturer.

8,Delta Air Lines to Take 20% Stake in Latam Airlines for $1.9 Billion - WSJ,The Wall Street Journal. Delta Air Lines to Take 20% Stake in Latam Airlines for $1.9 Billion. American had previously,"  Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL -1.05% is taking a stake in South America’s biggest airline, winning out over rival American Airlines Group Inc., which had also sought to work through that carrier to deepen its presence in Latin America. Delta said Thursday that it intends to buy a 20% stake in Chile-based Latam Airlines Group SA LTMAQ 4.35% for $1.9 billion in cash and newly issued debt. That would be Delta’s biggest investment since merging with Northwest Airlines over a decade ago. “This is the biggest region of the world that we had an open space,” Delta’s Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in an interview. “This largely completes the map.” The new partnership spells the end of a three-year effort by American Airlines to deepen cooperation with Latam. The news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.  Chilean antitrust regulators initially approved joint business agreements between Latam, American and the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, but the country’s Supreme Court rejected the arrangement in May. American said the ruling would have reduced the benefits of the partnership by excluding Chile. “We understand Latam’s decision to partner with a U.S. carrier that isn’t burdened by the ruling,” American said. The airline added that it doesn’t expect the switch to have a significant financial impact on American. The new tie-up leaves American without a partner in Latin America as its competitors pair off in the fast-growing region for air travel. United Airlines Holdings Inc. is pursuing a joint business agreement with Colombian carrier Avianca Holdings in conjunction with Copa Holdings SA of Panama. Latam Airlines, formed by the 2012 joining of Chile’s Lan and Brazil’s Tam airlines, has significant operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, serving 143 destinations in all. American depository receipt shares of Latam surged around 45% in after-hours trading following the news. Mr. Bastian said that network hardly overlaps with Delta’s existing routes, giving him confidence regulators will approve the investment. The partnership would make Delta the largest carrier of passengers between the U.S. and South America, he said. Delta said the airlines expect to receive approval for the deal in one to two years. The Latam partnership is Delta’s latest equity investment to expand its global reach. The carrier owns 49% stakes in Grupo Aeromexico and Virgin Atlantic Ltd., as well as smaller investments in Air France-KLM SA, China","Sep 26, 2019",https://www.wsj.com/articles/delta-air-lines-to-take-20-stake-in-latam-airlines-for-1-9-billion-11569535436

13,What Causes The Stock Market Index to Fluctuate Every Moment?,What Causes The Stock Market Index To Fluctuate Every Moment?. Factors Which Drive Stock Market Index Up Or Down. Wish,"Watch a complete video on our webinar on 'Investing In The Post Covid-19 World. What's Next For Investors?'. Watch Now When you hear the word stock market index, two names which are most likely to ring across your mind are BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty. We also hear or read statements like “BSE Sensex went up by XYZ points” or “NSE Nifty fell by XYZ points” etc.

The BSE Sensex also referred to as the S&P Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index is a free-float market-weighted stock market index comprising of 30 well-established companies which are listed on Bombay Stock Exchange. These 30 companies which together form the BSE Sensex stock market index are some of the largest and most actively traded stocks and represent various industrial sectors of the Indian economy. Similarly, the NIFTY 50 stock market index represents the weighted average of 50 Indian company stocks in various sectors.

Stock prices move up and down every second due to fluctuations in supply and demand. To understand why the stock market index keeps fluctuating let’s take a look at an example.

Imagine you want to buy a particular product or a commodity, something which is very short in supply. You go to the shop, ask the seller about the price and are about to hand over the money, when the person standing behind you offers a higher price. The seller tells you sorry and decides to give the product to the other person when a third person comes up and offers a much higher price. As the product has a huge demand, but very limited supply the seller decides to give it the third person for the best price.

Now few days later, to overcome the shortage the government decides to import the commodity in bulk from neighbouring countries. Once the foreign shipment arrives, there is plenty of availability in the market. Now there are plenty of sellers but limited buyers so the price of the product drops sharply. So you can see the prices of the product went up and down depending on the supply and demand in the market for it.

Similarly, when more people want to buy a particular stock, its market price will go up. On the other hand, if more people are wanting to sell a stock, its price will decrease. Apart from the supply and demand another important factor which drives the stock market index up or down","Sep 25, 2019",https://researchandranking.com/blog/what-causes-the-stock-market-index-to-fluctuate-every-moment

The investment is part of a plan announced by Fiat Chrysler (FCA) last year to spend 5 billion euros in Italy between 2019-2021. The Italian-American automaker expects the plan to help it catch up with its main competitors in developing electric vehicles and counter a year of declining sales in Europe. Maserati said the new super sports model would be produced next year at its plant in Modena, northern Italy. The construction of a production line for the new SUV will start in early 2020 at the group's plant in Cassino, central Italy, with the first vehicles expected to hit the market in early 2021. Maserati added it would start producing in Turin an electrified version of its Ghibli sedan, which is set to become the brand's first ever hybrid vehicle, in 2020. It will also launch redesigned versions of its GranTurismo and GranCabrio models, the first full electric cars for Maserati. Maserati will invest 800 million euros to produce the new SUV and a further 800 million euros for the electrified versions of GranTurismo and GranCabrio. The company did not disclose the investments required for the super sports car and the Ghibli.

Adria Airways, which had already cancelled most of its flights on Tuesday and Wednesday due to financial problems, said it would cancel all flights on Thursday and Friday as well, except for a return flight between Ljubljana and Frankfurt. ""Adria Airways is still leading active discussions with potential new owners and major creditors and remains dedicated in reaching a positive solution for all,"" Adria said in a statement. Civil Aviation Agency chief Rok Marolt told a news conference that Adria needed a capital hike of several tens of millions of euros, and its licence would be taken away without further deliberation if the company failed to present a financial plan by the specified date. Slovenia's Economy Minister Zdravko Pocivalsek later told a separate news conference that the government was ready to consider possible options for helping Adria but that it ""will not put even one euro"" in the company as long as it is under the current ownership. Adria is the latest in a long line of small European airlines to run into financial trouble amid industry overcapacity, cut-throat competition and high fuel prices. It cancelled 158 flights on Tuesday and Wednesday - most of those scheduled - due to its financial problems, affecting more than 3,700 passengers. According to Reuters estimates, a similar number of passengers will be affected by cancellations on Thursday and Friday. Marolt said the financial plan would need to include contracts with the owners of leased planes and payments of overdue wages to Adria employees. After holding a meeting with Adria's management, Marolt told a news conference that the agency would act before next week if there was any indication that ""Adria would be digressing from flight security"".

18,"PIA CEO touts revenues, but without any financial statements - Newspaper - DAWN.COM","TODAY'S PAPER | DECEMBER 19, 2020. PIA CEO touts revenues, but without any financial statements. . Read more. PIA revenue","KARACHI: The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) chief executive officer has been touting the financial gains made by the national carrier all year, but the stock exchange still awaits financial statements from last year, and this year’s financial data has not even been sent to the auditors yet. In the meantime, CEO Air Marshall Arshad Mahmood Malik told a gathering at the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry in Karachi that the airline had increased its revenues by 41 per cent in the last six months, and is ready to induct more aircraft by the end of the year. Earlier in April, he had claimed that PIA has “achieved breakeven at the operational level”, meaning its revenues almost matched its operating costs, minus financing costs. Nevertheless, the management has been unable to release any financial statements for the airline beyond the year 2017. “The auditors are finalising the results for 2018” Mashood Tajwar, the spokesperson of the airline, tells Dawn when asked about the status of the financial statements that the company is yet to file. “They should be ready before the end of the year.” Airline filed results for the year 2017 only one month ago, nothing since For 2019, the delay will be longer since the company will be reappointing its auditors, he says. At the moment, two firms audit PIA’s financial statements: Grant Thornton Pakistan and BDO Pakistan. Reports emerged in January, attributed to sources within PIA, saying that the airline’s auditors had refused to sign the company’s financial statements for the first half and third quarter of 2017 due to some missing records. The airline management at that time uploaded the unsigned statements on their website nonetheless. The auditors at the time were Ernst & Young Ford Rhodes and KPMG Taseer Hadi and Co, two of the country’s top auditors. The last financial statements that PIA reported are for the year 2017, and they were published on the stock exchange on Aug 25, almost two years after the year that they describe. “The reason for the delay is a software glitch,” Tajwar tells Dawn. He says two new accounting softwares were acquired by the airline in 2016, and their installation has taken some time, and then more time has been taken up to make staff proficient in the use of these softwares. “By middle of 2018 our team became proficient in the use of this software, so","Sep 25, 2019",https://www.dawn.com/news/1507266
