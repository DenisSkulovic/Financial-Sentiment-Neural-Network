2,"Coronavirus: Airline stocks tumble as illness spreads to South Korea, Italy",Airline stocks tumble as the coronavirus spreads outside of China. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"Airline stocks fell Monday as fears about the spread of the coronavirus beyond China added to worries about travel demand and the broader economy, despite a drop in fuel prices. American Airlines shares dropped 8.5% to $25.45, a more than four-month low. Delta Air Lines’ stock lost 6.3% to end at $54.23, lowest price in nearly four months, while United Airlines ended off 3.3% and Southwest Airlines fell 4.3%. The S&P 500 ended the day 3.4% lower. Close to 80,000 cases of the virus, now known as COVID-19, have been reported along with at least 2,621 deaths. Cases outside of China, where most of the infections are located, have increased, with Italy reporting more than 220 and South Korea confirming more than 830. Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warned citizens not to travel to affected areas, helping drive down shares of European carriers. Budget airline easyJet lost nearly 16.7% while rival Ryanair fell 13.5%. Deutsche Lufthansa fell 8.8%, British Airways’ parent, International Consolidated Airlines Group, fell more than 9% and Air France-KLM lost 8.7%. More than 200,000 flights to, from and within China have already been canceled because of the virus, according to aviation consulting firm Cirium, and more disruptions are possible if the virus continues to spread. The coronavirus is expected to eat into carriers’ revenue this year. Air travel demand globally is set to fall for the first time since 2009 and cost airlines some $29 billion — mostly in the Asia-Pacific region — in revenue, the International Air Transport Association warned last week. All U.S. carriers have already suspended service to mainland China and Hong Kong because of the outbreak of COVID-19. New cases in South Korea, Iran and Italy have added to concerns about the rapid spread of the virus, as airlines look ahead to the busy travel periods in the second and third quarters.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Alice Hancock Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story EasyJet and Ryanair led a plunge in European airline shares on Monday, as an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy ignited fears that travel across the continent will grind to a halt. The airlines and hotel sectors most exposed to Europe were the hardest hit on a day marked by steep falls on stock markets from London to Milan. By early afternoon in London easyJet shares were down 15 per cent, Ryanair stock had dropped 12 per cent and Accor, one of Europe’s largest hotel groups, was down 6.3 per cent. “What had been priced in by the market so far was weakness in China and a little bit of spillover into Asia Pacific from concerns about Chinese tourists not travelling so much,” said Harry Martin, a leisure analyst at Bernstein. “But today the panic is if we are going to have a global slowdown in travel.” The concern in markets came even as Brussels said it had no plans to suspend the continent’s Schengen free travel zone and warned against a “panic” reaction to the news that Italian authorities had quarantined at least 10 towns in the north of the country. The threat of disruption to European travel comes on top of the slowdown hoteliers and airlines have faced in China, the epicentre of a virus that has already claimed more than 2,500 lives. “If [coronavirus] spreads further — say more widely into Europe — then we believe travel and lodging companies would be among the first to experience subdued earnings and cash flows,” analysts at rating agency S&P Global noted. However, investors were not waiting to find out as European carriers were subjected to heavy selling. Shares in both IAG, the parent company of British Airways, and Air France-KLM were each down 10 per cent. Norwegian Air suffered an 8 per cent drop. The International Air Transport Association warned last week that the virus would inflict a $1bn hit on airline industry’s revenues, as it scrapped its forecast that global passenger numbers would rise this year. InterContinental and Accor were punished hardest among hoteliers, as investors targeted those companies with significant exposure to Europe. InterContinental generates about 30 per cent of its revenues in Europe, while Accor relied on the continent for more than half its sales last year.

Coronavirus: Week of Feb. 23 to Feb. 29, Dow","Nikkei futures point to sharply lower opening in global sell-off NEW YORK/TOKYO -- U.S. stocks ended a brutal session Monday down more than 3% as investors worried about the global economic impact of coronavirus outbreaks rapidly spreading beyond China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,030 points, or 3.6%, to close with its biggest one-day decline in two years. The broader S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell more than 3%, following European and Asian shares in a global sell-off after Italy and South Korea reported surges in infection cases. Airlines were among the hardest hit, with American Airlines down more than 8% and Delta Air Lines falling 6%. Virus-related travel declines now threaten Asian carriers' viability. Technology stocks were not immune to the sell-off. Apple, Microsoft, Intel and Qualcomm all tumbled more than 4%. As investors showed concerns over the virus' impact on economic activity, money moved into gold and U.S. Treasuries, sending long-term interest rates as low as 1.36%. Dave Lutz, head of exchange-traded fund trading at JonesTrading, said markets were witnessing a ""flight to quality"" in assets. Monday was a down day for most Asian markets. South Korea's benchmark Kospi dropped nearly 4% to a roughly two-month low, with Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and other blue chips sinking. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3%, while Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore benchmarks dropped 1.2% to 1.8%. The Japanese market was closed for a holiday.

Carnival, American Airlines and easyJet plunge on speculation that more flights might be"," Shares of airlines and travel companies around the world plunged Monday, led by cruise-line Carnival Corp. and easyJet PLC, on speculation that authorities may crack down on movement after the biggest outbreak of coronavirus outside Asia emerged in Italy. Carnival, which operates 10 cruise brands, was the biggest loser in the S&P 500, dropping 9.5%. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. declined 9.4%, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. fell 9% and American Airlines Group Inc. was down 8.6%. In Europe, easyJet shares plummeted 16.9%, their biggest drop since the U.K. voted to leave the EU in June 2016. The decline made the U.K. airline the worst performer in the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index. Ryanair slid 13.5%, while Air France tumbled 8.7% and Deutsche Lufthansa lost 8.8%. The declines came amid a broader selloff in global markets, with oil prices and stocks around the world retreating sharply as new pockets of the coronavirus infection came to light in South Korea, Italy and Iran. That has sharpened anxieties about the global economic impact of the outbreak, which already shows signs of curtailing manufacturing and consumption in China, the world’s second-biggest economy.","Feb 24, 2020",https://www.wsj.com/articles/european-airline-stocks-tumble-as-coronavirus-spreads-in-italy-11582552223

8,Why Shares of Southwest Airline Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Southwest Airline Are Falling Today. Coronavirus concerns are catching up with domestic-focused travel stocks.. What happened. So,"   Shares of domestic-focused Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) so far in 2020 had held up better than shares of the company's more international-dependent rivals, with the stock up more than 5% for the year heading into this week's trading compared to the NYSE Arca Airline Index's 5% decline. That all changed on Monday as Southwest shares fell 5% on word the coronavirus is expanding rapidly around the globe. Southwest shares joined in a broader market sell-off after reports of widespread coronavirus cases in Italy and South Korea. Airline stocks are a logical target for investors looking to reduce risk, and indeed airline shares were hard hit in January as the coronavirus outbreak originally worsened. But the conventional wisdom then was the coronavirus was a problem mainly in China or, at most, Asia, and carriers like Southwest that only fly domestically and to the Caribbean were not caught up in the initial sell-off. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The virus's aggressive spread is making investors question that initial assumption and reconsider the potential impact on Southwest and other U.S.-focused travel businesses. Even if the U.S. averts a widespread outbreak, the renewed focus on the virus is coming just as U.S. travelers are in the process of planning summer vacations. It's at least possible that concerns about the virus will suppress U.S. travel demand during the key summer holiday season and impact the results of Southwest and other airlines. The market hates uncertainty, so it's no surprise to see shares of Southwest selling off today. Southwest has other challenges on its plate right now, most notably its reliance on Boeing's troubled 737 aircraft, so it might make sense for those with a low risk tolerance to watch from the sidelines. But for a long-term holder with the stomach to ride through turbulence, Southwest is just as good an investment today as it was a month ago. There is likely to be continued volatility as this situation plays out, but Southwest has the wherewithal to power through these headwinds.    Before you consider Southwest Airlines Co., you'll want to hear this. Investing legends and Motley Fool Co-founders David and Tom Gardner just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Southwest Airlines Co. wasn't one of them.

9,"Airline, cruise stocks pummeled on fear of spreading virus","Airline, cruise stocks pummeled on fear of spreading virus","The stocks of American Airlines and several cruise lines were among the worst performers in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index Monday, as investors fret that the new coronavirus could take hold outside China and further disrupt international travel. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. tumbled about 9%. American Airlines Group Inc. shed 8.5%, and Delta Air Lines Inc. and online travel agency Expedia Group Inc. fell more than 6%. After the market closed, United Airlines said it was withdrawing its estimate issued just last month of its full-year 2020 earnings because of uncertainty around how long the virus outbreak will last. The airline stood by its first-quarter earnings estimates, saying that a drop in fuel prices and a new credit card deal will offset revenue lost because of the virus. United, like its U.S. and international counterparts, has suspended flights to mainland China and Hong Kong. United said in a regulatory filing that there is no demand for flights to China, and that March bookings tumbled 75% for other flights across the Pacific. United said that if the virus runs its course by mid-May and travel on trans-Pacific routes returns to normal over five months, the airline could still hit its goal of 2020 earnings between $11 and $13 per share. Before United’s news, CFRA Research lowered its investment rating on United Airlines Holdings Inc. to “hold” from “buy.” The firm says United is even more dependent on international revenue than American or Delta. However, United’s stock ended down a relatively modest 3.3%. United investors might have been partially mollified by unrelated news that the airline extended a credit card agreement with Chase and Visa through 2029, increasing the deal’s 2020 cash contribution to the airline by an estimated $400 million. The extension was announced after the market closed Friday. Fears about the new virus’ effect on the global economy grew after a spike in new cases reported in Italy, South Korea and Iran. Italy imposed travel restrictions in some areas to prevent the virus from spreading. There are signs that the impact on travel in China, where the virus started, may be hitting a plateau or even easing. OAG, an aviation-data firm, said Chinese airlines scheduled an increase of more than 25% in seats on domestic flights this week, the first gain in more than a month. However, OAG cautioned","Feb 24, 2020",https://apnews.com/article/63141cad66108a3912109b64aedc128d

European stock markets clawed back some of the big losses felt on Monday but fell again later on Tuesday. A surge of new cases of coronavirus, particularly in Italy, has prompted a sell-off across the continent.   European stocks rebounded in early Tuesday trading before falling back again after Monday's battering on the back of renewed coronavirus fears. The regional Stoxx 600 index rose 0.5% in the early minutes of European trading but lost those to slip by a significant 1.1% by afternoon trading.Italy, where the vast majority of European cases of the virus have been detected, saw its FTSE MIB move 0.5% higher having lost 5% of its value on Monday. It fell back into a loss by the afternoon. In London, Frankfurt and Paris, early gains on Tuesday gave way to losses by the afternoon. The London FTSE, Paris CAC and Frankfurt DAX all lost between 0.4% and 0.8%.  Asian stock markets stabilised somewhat on Tuesday. A wave of early selling caused some tremors but South Korea's stocks edged to a 0.6% rise. Shanghai's blue-chip index also clawed back losses while Hong Kong snapped its three-day losing streak with a small gain of 0.3 percent.  The one exception in Asia was Japan. Tokyo's Nikkei index plunged by 3.4% after a government panel in the country warned that the country was on the brink of a rapid expansion in coronavirus cases.  Tuesday's modest recovery follows a severe day of losses on Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1,029 points lower, or 3.55%. The S&P 500 slid 3.4% while the Nasdaq Composite closed 3.7% lower. It was the Dow’s biggest point and percentage-point drop since February 2018. The Dow also gave up its gain for 2020.

16,Airlines plunge on coronavirus outbreak -  Investors' Chronicle,"Airlines plunge on coronavirus outbreak. Airlines around the world are forecasting hits to earnings. MOST READ
Today. Terry Smith talks big","Airline stocks were some of the biggest fallers on Monday 24 February, a day that saw mounting fears over Covid-19 drag down the FTSE 100 index by more than 3 per cent. London-listed airlines including International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), easyJet (EZY) and Wizz Air (WIZZ) plunged amid a rising death toll and disruption in Italy, a key destination for UK travellers. A surge in infections in Northern Italy has prompted the closure of towns and the cancellation of events, as Italy recorded 4 deaths and 152 cases at the start of the week, compared with just 17 on Friday 20 February. Italy represents around 9 per cent of European Economic Area (EEA) capacity. A transport strike taking place on 25 February will also cause problems for flights attempting to leave and enter Italy. The news means that concerns over airlines’ ability to operate are no longer limited to Asia-Pacific operators. The Italian disruption follows an alarming statement from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) last week, which forecast a $29.3bn (£22.3bn) cut to airline revenues prompted by the virus. The trade body expects airlines from Asia-Pacific to lose $27.8bn and those in the rest of the world $1.5bn. This last figure is now likely to rise given the subsequent news from Italy. The outbreak is likely to temper airline demand from North America, which would harm IAG in particular given its extensive transatlantic activity. IAG shares fell 9 per cent at the start of the week. The group counts British Airways and Iberia among its roster of brands. British Airways, which represents between 60 per cent to 85 per cent of IAG’s profitability. has cancelled flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until April 17, 2020. Iberia has cancelled flights from Madrid to Shanghai. EasyJet, Wizz Air and Ryanair (RYA) are likely to be affected by travel restrictions and contractions in demand linked to Italian travel. Ryanair, whose shares fell by nearly 14 per cent on Monday, said that all of its flights were currently operating normally. easyJet and Wizz Air shares fell 17 per cent and 11 per cent respectively, while Tui (TUI), whose stock fell 10 per cent, said that it had not been disrupted by the coronavirus thus far.

Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. tumbled about 9%. American Airlines Group Inc. shed 8.5%, and Delta Air Lines Inc. and online travel agency Expedia Group Inc. fell more than 6%. After the market closed, United Airlines said it was withdrawing its estimate issued just last month of its full-year 2020 earnings because of uncertainty around how long the virus outbreak will last. The airline stood by its first-quarter earnings estimates, saying that a drop in fuel prices and a new credit card deal will offset revenue lost because of the virus.

The extension was announced after the market closed Friday. Fears about the new virus’ effect on the global economy grew after a spike in new cases reported in Italy, South Korea and Iran. Italy imposed travel restrictions in some areas to prevent the virus from spreading. There are signs that the impact on travel in China, where the virus started, may be hitting a plateau or even easing. OAG, an aviation-data firm, said Chinese airlines scheduled an increase of more than 25% in seats on domestic flights this week, the first gain in more than a month.
