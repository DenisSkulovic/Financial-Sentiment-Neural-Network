0,Is the easyJet share price still a millionaire maker? - The Motley Fool UK,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Is the easyJet share,"      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Roland Head | Saturday, 27th July, 2019 | More on: EZJ FEVR One secret that’s shared by many millionaire investors is that the bulk of their wealth originally came from just one or two big successes. Between 2011 and 2014, easyJet (LSE: EZJ) was just such an investment. The budget airline’s share price quadrupled from 325p in September 2011 to 1,359p three years later. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... Today, easyJet shares are trading at about 1,060p, a level which arguably makes them look cheap. In this article I’ll be asking whether now is the right time to start buying this airline stock. Budget airlines like easyJet say that their low-cost, high-volume business models mean they will avoid the boom-and-bust cycles that have affected the airline industry in the past. Despite this, we’re currently seeing the same old themes emerge. Overcapacity in the short-haul market is pushing down ticket prices, but rising fuel and wage bills are lifting costs. So far we’ve seen the group’s after-tax profits fall from a record of £548m in 2015 to just £358m last year. Despite this, careful management of costs and well-filled flights still enabled the group to generate an underlying return on capital employed of 14.4% in 2018. That’s a respectable figure, in my opinion. easyJet’s profits have already fallen substantially. Is this the bottom for the company’s share price? One interesting point that struck me from the airline’s latest analyst presentation is that it’s planning for big changes to its fleet. Today it has 332 aircraft, but by 2023, this number may have risen to 403 or fallen to 283, depending on market conditions. This flexible planning is impressive, but it also suggests to me a high level of uncertainty about the outlook for the European short-haul market. As things stand, easyJet’s profits are expected to fall by about 25% this year, before returning to growth next year. At current levels, the stock trades on 12.5 times forecast earnings","Jul 27, 2019",https://www.fool.co.uk/investing/2019/07/27/is-the-easyjet-share-price-still-a-millionaire-maker/

USD/JPY.,"                                                   By Peter Rutherford GWANGJU, South Korea, July 29 (Reuters) - If the world swimming championships in Gwangju were just a taste of what is to come at the 2020 Olympics, then in the words of recently retired Australian sprinter James Magnussen -- ""Brace yourselves"". A meet that was supposed to serve as an indicator of form heading into next year's Games in Tokyo, the championships delivered this and more. Much, much more. Champions were dethroned, new national heroes born and world records smashed. Swimmers pushed the limits of performance and the boundaries of sportsmanship. The scourge of doping reared its head once more. After winning six gold and two silver medals, it would be safe to say Caeleb Dressel will arrive in Tokyo with a huge target on his back. The U.S. sprint specialist became the first swimmer to win eight medals at a single world championships, taking down Olympic great Michael Phelps's 10-year-old 100 metres butterfly world record for good measure. The 22-year-old became the spearhead of the U.S. challenge in Gwangju after freestyle queen Katie Ledecky succumbed to illness and, after surrendering her 400 title to rising Australian star Ariarne Titmus, pulled out of two more events. Ledecky recovered enough to defend her 800 title but health issues notwithstanding, a growing cast of rivals will perhaps feel emboldened after Gwangju, where Italian Simona Quadarella emerged as a threat in the 800 and won the 1,500. There was no shortage of swimming storylines. Britain's Adam Peaty proved peerless in the 100 breaststroke once again, completing his 'Project 56' by becoming the first swimmer to breach 57 seconds. He also won gold in the 50 and another from Britain's sensational 4x100 medley relay win on the final night of competition. ""Looking good for next year and all ready for what comes with a bunch of four lads who are young but gathering experience,"" said Peaty after the relay. ""And yeah, I think we are going to smash it.""             The Roth IRA 5-year rule applies in three situations","Jul 28, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swimming-dust-still-settle-dramatic-033701595.html

MLB notebook: Jays send Stroman to Mets The Toronto Blue Jays traded right-handed pitcher Marcus Stroman and cash to the New York Mets for minor league pitchers Anthony Kay, a left-hander, and righty Simeon Woods-Richardson, both teams announced via Twitter on Sunday. Raised on Long Island, the 28-year-old Stroman has a 6-11 record and a 2.96 ERA in 21 starts this season. He was selected to his first All-Star team this year. In six seasons with the Blue Jays, Stroman is 47-45 with a 3.76 ERA in 789 2/3 innings. NASCAR notebook: Despite top 5, Byron left wishing for more You'd never know from William Byron's demeanor or his language that the 21-year-old driver of the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet had just finished fourth in Sunday's Gander RV 400 at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa. ""It was a struggle,"" said Byron, who restarted sixth in overtime and passed both Kyle Larson and Kevin Harvick to post his second top five of the season. ""I felt like the guys did a good job with strategy, and being able to maximize on restarts. We got fortunate on a couple of things. We go on from it and move on to Watkins Glen."" Bernal claims Colombia's first Tour de France title Egan Bernal became the first Colombian to win the Tour de France when he retained the overall leader's yellow jersey after Sunday's 21st and final stage won by Caleb Ewan of Australia. The 22-year-old Bernal, the youngest rider to win the race in 110 years, gave Team Ineos -- formerly Team Sky -- their seventh title in the last eight editions.

7,Boeing's 737 Max woes have global repercussions - MarketWatch,MarketWatch Site Logo A link that brings you back to the homepage. .mwA1{fill:#ffffff;} .mwA2{fill:#4db74d;}. Boeing's 737 Max woes have global,"More than four months after the grounding of Boeing Co.'s best-selling 737 MAX, the passenger jet's absence is hitting profits, crimping growth and throwing service schedules into disarray at airlines around the world. Southwest Airlines Co., Boeing's biggest MAX customer, said Thursday it would stop flying out of New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport this fall as it tries to offset the impact of the prolonged grounding. It also extended planned cancellations through Jan. 5. While a handful of American carriers have been affected by the grounding, a big chunk of MAX sales have been to airlines outside the U.S., in markets where air travel is climbing dramatically and low-cost carriers are building up their fleets of such fuel-efficient, single-aisle planes. That trajectory makes the grounding potentially much more disruptive than it has been so far in bigger markets such as North America. Low-cost carrier flydubai, the Middle East's largest MAX customer, with 251 orders and 14 already in its fleet, has canceled 17% of its flying schedule following the grounding. Oman Air, the sultanate's national carrier, with five MAX jets parked and orders for 25 more, recently canceled more than 800 flights through August. Carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest budget airline, said it expects a hit to 2019 profits, and it more than halved its summer 2020 passenger growth forecast to 3%. ""There is starting to be an impact on the winter schedules and 2020 plans,"" said Brendan Sobie, chief analyst at CAPA-Centre for Aviation in Singapore. That is ""likely to be much more significant than what we have seen so far given the size of the [MAX] fleet wasn't that huge at the time of the grounding in March."" Many of these smaller carriers have already been wounded by rising fuel prices, other cost increases and stiffer-than-expected competition. Now, they are feeling the most pain from the MAX grounding, too -- both because the financial hit can be more extreme and because their smaller fleet sizes make them less flexible. In Southeast Asia, one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world, capacity at budget carrier SilkAir is forecast to drop 3% over the next year, thanks largely to the grounding, parent company Singapore Airlines Ltd. said. SilkAir operates six MAX jets, with another 31 on order. The grounding has also delayed plans to transfer some of SilkAir's existing planes to another group airline, Scoot, impacting that","Jul 28, 2019",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeings-737-max-woes-have-global-repercussions-2019-07-28

10,Virgin Galactic: Should You Invest in the First Commercial Space Travel Stock? | The Motley Fool,Virgin Galactic: Should You Invest in the First Commercial Space Travel Stock?. Investing in the first public commercial space company,"   Investing in companies pioneering new industries in which the rules haven't yet been written is typically reserved for venture capital investors who can stomach much higher risk and uncertainty. But every so often, a truly novel business concept becomes available in the public markets as well. Virgin Galactic, a leader in the future industry of commercial space travel, fits this description. It was recently announced that Virgin Galactic will float as a publicly traded stock after merging with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings (NYSE:IPOA), an already-public special purpose acquisition company. The transaction will see legendary business mogul Sir Richard Branson join forces with billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya to pioneer a new type of business. On paper, the new company is certainly interesting -- but is it worth investing in? IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Virgin Galactic is a commercial space travel company with a vision to disrupt long-haul travel. The company is still pre-revenue but intends to begin operating a space tourism business in 2020. The basic idea is that extremely rich people are willing to spend a ridiculous amount of money on unique and exclusive leisure activities. For example, a wealthy person might charter a luxury yacht or rent a private island for hundreds of thousands of dollars per week. Also, it can cost upward of $100,000 to use a private jet for a long-range flight. Virgin Galactic intends to charge $250,000 per person for a four-day space tourism experience. This price is in line with what a rich person might spend for other unique travel experiences but comes with even greater bragging rights because of how few people have had the experience of orbiting the earth. The graphic below highlights the four-day itinerary, culminating in approximately 90 minutes of time spent in actual orbit. IMAGE SOURCE: VIRGIN GALACTIC. It might sound unlikely, but there is apparently a fairly large market for this. Virgin Galactic has already taken $80 million in deposits for approximately 600 reservations. At its current price, the product is largely limited to multimillionaires; however, there are roughly two million people in the world with a net worth greater than $10 million. The company only needs about 1,000 people a year to buy its service to have a viable business -- 1,000 people is less than a tenth of 1% of the two million people who could probably afford it.

13,Don't Let Panic Attacks Ruin Your Vacation,Don't Let Panic Attacks Ruin Your Vacation. Be Prepared. Plan Ahead. Develop Your Relaxation Response,"Panic attacks can strike at any time without warning. These attacks are typically experienced through a combination of uncomfortable physical sensations, disturbing thoughts, and upsetting emotions. Common somatic symptoms include rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, excessive sweating, and chest pain. It is not unusual for a person to become frightened during a panic attack, feeling as if they are losing touch with reality and fearing that they will lose control or even possibly die. Panic attacks don’t care if you’re driving, busy working, or sound asleep. They can occur at any moment without cause even when you’re trying to enjoy yourself while on vacation. Do you have a big trip coming up and feel worried that panic attacks will ruin your vacation? Read ahead to discover 3 tips for managing your panic attacks while on vacation. If you want to travel with ease, it is important to leave for vacation feeling equipped to get through your panic attacks as they occur. You may want to have a plan with whomever you are traveling with as to what the strategy is if a panic attack takes hold. For example, you may request that your loved ones give you the space you need to recover and allowing them to enjoy some activities while you go back to the room to center and settle down. Some additional steps you can take to prepare for your trip include completing any follow up with your prescribing doctor and/or therapist. Let your clinician know your concerns about traveling and make sure you have enough of your medication to take with you. If you are currently participating in psychotherapy, you may want to have several sessions leading up to your trip where your main focus in therapy is how you will cope with your panic attacks while traveling. Keeping a good schedule and plan can be one of the best ways to keep your anxiety to a minimum while traveling. Have a clear itinerary, book your hotel and other accommodations ahead of time, and be ready for the unexpected. It helps to be organized, but your anxiety can also be better managed if you aren’t too rigid. Have a backup plan if there’s a rainy day or if the museum you couldn’t wait to see is closed. And don’t sweat the little hiccups that can occur while traveling.
