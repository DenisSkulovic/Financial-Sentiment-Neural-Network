0,American Airlines and More of the Worst Industrial Stocks So Far in 2019 | Barron's,The 3 Worst Industrial Stocks So Far This Year Are Household Names. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. Barron's Tech. . . American Airlines.,"  A weekly guide to our best stories on technology, disruption, and the people and stocks in the middle of it all.  It’s post-Labor Day,
so, for all intents and purposes, summer is done.  Children are back in school and, more important to Barron’s, investors can prepare for the stretch run to the end of the year. To help out, we’re looking at the best and worst stocks so far in 2019, by sector, to try to identify risks that could derail a portfolio. We are also searching for opportunities to make a great year out of what have been pretty good returns so far. And 2019 has been pretty good by most stock-market measures. Trade wars
and bond curve inversions are two reasons investors are nervous, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 15% year to date. Industrial stocks, like the broader market, have done relatively well in 2019, despite the fact that global industrial activity has been down since peaking around December 2017.  The industrial components of the S&P 500, which include stocks such as Caterpillar (ticker: CAT) and General Electric (GE), are up almost 19% year to date, in line with the performance of the broader market. Still, there are plenty of industrial stocks that are down significantly this year, including some household names, such as 3M (MMM) and American Airlines (AAL). American, of course, is an airline, but all transportation companies, including airlines, are classified as industrial companies. (Car companies, by comparison, are classified as consumer discretionary. Go figure.) American stock isn’t just the weakest large airline stock–it’s the worst-performing industrial stock year to date, down 17%. Recession fears weigh on all airline stocks, but American has also had to navigate through labor conflict with its machinists
as well as problems with the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX jet.  The single-aisle plane has been grounded world-wide
since mid-March following the second tragic crash in the space of a few months. Boeing continues to work with global aviation authorities to safely return its MAX jet to service, believing it can do so by the end of the year.  When the MAX returns, all U.S. airlines, including American, will have to manage through abnormal capacity growth in a weakening economy. That could lead to lower fares and reduced earnings. Still, with American stock trading at 4.7 times estimated 2020 earnings, a lot of bad news","Sep 3, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/worst-industrial-stocks-labor-day-2019-51567187166
1,"Cisco could be on a fast track to December lows, analyst warns","If Cisco breaks this level, it’ll be on a fast track to the December lows, analyst warns. MORE IN TRADING","Cisco’s shares are crumbling. Shares of the technology giant fell nearly 16% in August, sharply reversing their broader 2019 uptrend and falling to just under the $47 level by the end of trading on Friday. The action marks Cisco’s worst monthly performance since 2012 and makes the stock the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for August. While Cisco is still up 8% for the year, experts aren’t convinced the pain is over. “We’re really just stuck in kind of a trading range,” Craig Johnson, senior technical research analyst at Piper Jaffray, said Friday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “From our perspective, this stock looks like it’s probably going to pull back.”  Johnson expects Cisco’s stock to fall to at least the $44 level, which he said would provide “a little short-term support.” “At worst case, you go back and you retest the lower end of this trading range” between $40 and $60, meaning Cisco could retest its Christmas Eve 2018 lows, the analyst warned. “We’ve got a little bit more shakeout here to go before we’re really going to step up and put fresh dollars to work,” he said. For Steve Chiavarone, vice president, portfolio manager and equity strategist at Federated Investors, Cisco didn’t make the list of his top picks in the tech space. “When you think about the economy, it’s really been this dichotomy between a very strong consumer and ... more reticent business spending. Unfortunately, Cisco’s an example of a company that’s kind of caught on the wrong side of that,” he said. Between slower enterprise spending and the U.S.-China trade dispute, Cisco is suffering, and there are better options to go with in the tech world, Chiavarone said in the same interview. “Our preference [is] companies that are tied more to the consumer and disruptive technologies,” he said. “We think, in the short run, that’s where the better risk-return is.” Cisco shares lost nearly 1% in Friday trading.

3,United Airlines and American Airlines Extend Boeing 737 MAX Cancellations | The Motley Fool,United Airlines and American Airlines Extend Boeing 737 MAX Cancellations. Airlines are still unsure when the Boeing 737 MAX will,"   The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX still needs to clear a few hurdles before it can return to service. However, over the past two months, Boeing has made significant progress toward finalizing software fixes for the issues identified by the FAA and other aviation regulators. This has kept the Boeing 737 MAX on track for an official FAA validation flight sometime next month. That said, even an October validation flight probably wouldn't leave enough time for airlines to put their 737 MAX fleets back into service by early November -- as United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) had been planning until recently. As a result, both airline giants recently removed all 737 MAX flights from their schedules until December. TWO MAJOR AIRLINES ARE EXTENDING THEIR 737 MAX FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS INTO DECEMBER. IMAGE SOURCE: BOEING. As of mid-July, United Airlines had hoped to put its Boeing 737 MAX jets back into service on Nov. 3. However, in the face of uncertainty about the timeline for recertifying the 737 MAX, the carrier announced late last week that it would remove the troubled model from its schedules until Dec. 19. It will cancel nearly 100 flights a day during this period. American Airlines followed suit on Sunday morning. The world's largest airline extended its 737 MAX flight cancellations from Nov. 2 to Dec. 3. This will force it to cancel an average of about 140 flights per day during the month of November. While American Airlines remains slightly more optimistic than United about when the Boeing 737 MAX will return, there is little practical difference between the two airlines' recent schedule changes. Neither one will have the 737 MAX available for the busy Thanksgiving travel weekend, but both still hope to get the aircraft back in service in time for the peak season around Christmas. The period in between those two holidays tends to be one of the slowest times of the year for airlines. Canceling flights over the Thanksgiving long weekend will lead to lost profits, particularly for American Airlines. Whereas United has expanded its fleet significantly during 2019, American will end 2019 with fewer mainline aircraft than it had at the beginning of the year, even if the Boeing 737 MAX were to be ungrounded. This is largely due to the carrier's decision to retire its aging fleet of MD-80s this week.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Converting Isobutanol or Fusel Oils to Renewable Diesel ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Sept. 04, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevo, Inc. (GEVO) a leading renewable fuels and chemicals manufacturer, announced today that it has developed proprietary, breakthrough processes that converts either low-carbon isobutanol or low-value “fusel oils,” a mixture of alcohols that are byproducts from fermentation processes such as alcohol production, into renewable diesel. This renewable diesel is expected to compete head-to-head on price with natural and petroleum-based equivalents, while reducing particulates and CO2 emissions. Low-carbon renewable diesel is biomass-derived transportation fuel suitable for use in diesel engines and has increased in demand since the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) went into effect. Additionally, the marine sector will have to reduce sulphur emissions to meet new international water regulations beginning in 2020. Gevo expects this to open yet another door for Gevo products.

“Not only are we going after the whole gallon to replace fossil-based fuels, we are going after the whole slate of renewable low-carbon liquid fuel products. In addition to being a low-carbon intensity fuel, our product has no sulfur or particulates,“ stated Dr. Patrick Gruber, Chief Executive Officer of Gevo “This technology leverages off our platform of low-carbon alcohols and I give credit to our catalytic chemistry team, led by Jonathan Smith, for this breakthrough.”

About Gevo
Gevo is a next generation “low-carbon” fuel company focused on the development and commercialization of renewable alternatives to petroleum-based products. Low-carbon fuels reduce the carbon intensity, or the level of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to standard fossil-based fuels across their lifecycle. The most common low-carbon fuels are renewable fuels. Gevo is focused on the development and production of mainstream fuels like gasoline and jet fuel using renewable feedstocks that have the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions at a meaningful scale and enhance agricultural production, including food and other related products. In addition to serving the low-carbon fuel markets, through Gevo’s technology, Gevo can also serve markets for the production of chemical intermediate products for solvents, plastics, and building block chemicals.

7,Delta Air Lines Stock Up 16% YTD: Clear Skies Ahead?,Delta Air Lines Stock Up 16% YTD: Clear Skies Ahead?. DAL: No exposure to Boeing MAX jets. Delta’s strong financial,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO So far in 2019, Delta Air Lines (DAL) stock has emerged as a leader in the airline industry, as most of its peers didn’t keep pace with the broader market. With a year-to-date return of 16%, the stock is one of the top performers in the airline industry. Delta stock has outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s YTD gain of 13.2%. Among Delta Air Lines’ peers, American Airlines (AAL) stock has lagged the US airline industry. American Airlines has lost 18% of its market value so far this year. Southwest Airlines (LUV) and United Airlines (UAL) have gained 12.6% and 0.7%, respectively. DAL stock also outshined the iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT), which is up 10.6% YTD. This ETF invests in Dow Jones transportation stocks and has allocated 20.5% of the fund to the passenger airline industry. In this article, we’ll look at the factors that could drive Delta stock higher. The major supporting factor for Delta stock is its lack of exposure to Boeing (BA) 737 MAX aircraft. Notably, these 737 MAX aircraft have faced a global flying ban since mid-March following two fatal crashes within five months. The grounding of the 737 MAX jet has caused thousands of flight cancellations to Delta Air Lines’ top three peers. Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and United Airlines together operate 72 MAX planes. From mid-March until the end of the second quarter, Southwest Airlines has canceled over 20,000 flights due to the 737 MAX’s grounding. American Airlines and United Airlines together had canceled more than 11,000 MAX flights in the second quarter. These three airlines have lost billions of dollars due to massive flight cancelations. In its August 6 report, OAG stated that the US airlines could lose $4 billion in revenues and associated expenses if the 737 MAX remains grounded throughout October. During their latest earnings results, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines both revealed that the extended MAX grounding cost them $175 million during the second quarter. Further, the MAX grounding is impacting the expansion plans of airline companies, as it has reduced their fleet counts as well as seating capacity. During the second quarter, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines recorded YoY declines of 3.6% and 0.8%, respectively, in their seating capacity. As Delta Air Lines doesn’t own any 737 MAX variants, it is safeguarded from the damage from the aircraft’s grounding.

9,Avoid these 10 of the Worst Investments Ever | MyBankTracker,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Avoid the 10 Worst Investments," MyBankTracker has compiled a haunting, nightmarish list of the worst investments you could ever make. It’s a graveyard of horrors ready to suck the life right out of your money. But don’t let it spook you too much because we also offer some investment alternatives to offset this spine-tingling list of horrors. Chin up, but proceed with caution: Contents You know the pitch: Listen to our 90-minute presentation in exchange for a free weekend for two at our luxury resort. If you take the bait and purchase a timeshare, you should turn as white as a ghost. Why? Let’s say, that condo you get to enjoy for one week each year into perpetuity costs you $20,000. If, however, that unit is sold 51 more times, accounting for the 52 weeks there are in a year, the sellers are placing its value at a little over a million dollars (20,000 x 52 = $1,040,000). The real horror is, your unit might truly be worth only $200,000, and that’s before calculating yearly maintenance costs. Instead, try: Conservatively investing the money in a 5-year CD at 2.35 percent,  leaving you a total of $22,463.08 after five years. That’s a much shorter time horizon, and the money remains all yours rather than having it tied up for life in a condo you get to access one week out of the year.   Race horses are fast, but they’ll drain your financial resources even faster. After purchasing a thoroughbred, you have to board, train, shod, groom, hot-walk, medicate, and feed it, not to mention, find a jockey to ride it before your half-ton steed ever makes it onto the racetrack. That’s about a $60,000 tab a year. One bloodstock agent (a seller of horses) estimated that for every for $100 you invest in a horse, expect to lose $79. In other words, for every $100 you lay out, you’re only going to see $21 in return. You would be better off plunking your money down on the favorite in each race, which win about one of every three races. That said, if you’ve got money to blow, what could be more fun than hanging out with your pals at the track and hanging on to a dream that your horse will be the next Secretariat.

Today, the president doubled-down on a previous prediction that the Dow Jones should be trading 10,000 points higher than where it is hovering today were it not for his obsession with China, which in theory would catapult the index to roughly 36,355. “Let me tell you, if I wanted to do nothing with China, our stock market, our stock market would be 10,000 points higher than it is right now but somebody had to do this. It was out of control and they were out of control.” The last time Trump made the same bold prediction, he blamed the Federal Reserve for the stock market’s performance, not China. Does that mean that if both China and the Fed were behaving, the stock market would be 20,000 points higher?

By: Harsh Chauhan | Email | Leave a comment There’s no doubt that President Donald Trump loves watching the stock market go up. After all, he has bragged at least 60 times about how the Dow Jones Industrial Average has performed since the 2016 election, and his tweets have the potential to make or break a stock. However, according to new research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the stock market hates when Trump tweets.   The investment bank analyzed the S&P 500’s daily movements on days when Trump was relatively quiet (publishing five or fewer tweets) compared to days when he was exceptionally prolific (unleashing more than 35 tweets). The analysis found a massive gap in the S&P 500’s daily performance based on those metrics. When Trump types too much, the stock market bellwether index tends to fall to the tune of 9 basis points. On saner days when he is more engaged in his presidential duties, the index climbs an average of 5 basis points. That’s a 0.14% swing. Of course, correlation does not equal causation, but Trump’s Twitter habits might be another variable that investors should monitor more closely. The problem is that there’s no way to predict to what extent Donald Trump is going to use Twitter on a particular day. But a closer look at recent trends suggests that he has been getting more active. President Trump’s activity on Twitter has picked up the pace in recent days, according to data from Trackalytics.

12,'It will be ugly': The Big Short's Michael Burry on why index funds are like subprime CDOs - BNN Bloomberg,. BNN. ETFS. . ETFS. Investing. News Wire. 'It will be ugly': The Big Short's Michael Burry on why index,"    Latest Videos  Sep 4, 2019  Reed Stevenson, Bloomberg News For an investor whose story was featured in a best-selling book and an Oscar-winning movie, Michael Burry has kept a surprisingly low profile in recent years. But it turns out the hero of “The Big Short” has plenty to say about everything from central bank fueled distortions in credit markets to opportunities in small-cap value stocks and the “bubble” in passive investing. One of his most provocative views from a lengthy email interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday: The recent flood of money into index funds has parallels with the pre-2008 bubble in collateralized debt obligations, the complex securities that almost destroyed the global financial system. Burry, who made a fortune betting against CDOs before the crisis, said index fund inflows are now distorting prices for stocks and bonds in much the same way that CDO purchases did for subprime mortgages more than a decade ago. The flows will reverse at some point, he said, and “it will be ugly” when they do. “Like most bubbles, the longer it goes on, the worse the crash will be,” said Burry, who oversees about US$340 million at Scion Asset Management in Cupertino, California. One reason he likes small-cap value stocks: they tend to be under-represented in passive funds. Here’s what else Burry had to say about indexing, liquidity, Japan and more. Comments have been lightly edited and condensed. Steve Eisman, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, joins BNN Bloomberg to provide his latest take on the Canadian bank earnings and why he's now shorting Canadian Tire. Index Funds and Price Discovery “Central banks and Basel III have more or less removed price discovery from the credit markets, meaning risk does not have an accurate pricing mechanism in interest rates anymore. And now passive investing has removed price discovery from the equity markets. The simple theses and the models that get people into sectors, factors, indexes, or ETFs and mutual funds mimicking those strategies -- these do not require the security-level analysis that is required for true price discovery. “This is very much like the bubble in synthetic asset-backed CDOs before the Great Financial Crisis in that price-setting in that market was not done by fundamental security-level analysis, but by massive capital flows based on Nobel-approved models of risk that proved to be untrue.” Liquidity Risk “The dirty secret","Sep 4, 2019",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-big-short-s-michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos-1.1310874
13,Latin American Firm Is Newest Bidder For Jet Airways: Here Are Its Previous Suitors,. Latin American firm is newest bidder for Jet Airways: Here are its previous suitors. South American conglomerate Synergy Group,"                                           South American conglomerate Synergy Group Corp has expressed an interest in acquiring a majority stake in the grounded Jet Airways, according to a Mint report. However, it has set certain terms and conditions, two of which are a deep haircut on the part of the lenders and conversion of their debt into equity. Synergy owns and operates several airlines in South America, including Colombian carrier Avianca Holdings, the region's second largest airline. The company's legal advisor told the Mint newspaper the company is exploring ways to pick up a majority stake in the grounded Jet. Current regulations do not allow foreign airlines to own more than 49 percent stake even though the government has indicated that it would like relax that norm. Following a severe cash crunch, Jet Airways suspended operations in April this year. Since then, its lenders have been trying to sell the beleaguered airline. In order to recover dues worth Rs 8,500 crore, a consortium of 26 banks approached the National Company Law Tribunal route (NCLT). The lenders’ efforts to get a new owner for Jet haven’t met with success so far -- the company has undergone two failed rounds of bidding, while the third round concluded on August 31 -- but not for lack of suitors. In fact, since the airline was put through the insolvency process, several parties have bid for it, including some whose credentials, or even seriousness in wanting to run an airline, have been called into question. Here's a list of its previous suitors: - First in line of unexpected suitors was James Unsworth, a former British Airline service agent, who claimed to have founded a startup, Atmosphere Intercontinental. He said that his yet-to-be-operational premium airline service would connect parts of Asia, and was confident that he would be able to revive the sinking airline, if given a chance. -Next is Ajay Harinath Singh, a resident of Mumbai and the chairman of city-based Darwin Platform Group, a company that allegedly runs businesses in information technology (IT), pharmaceuticals, power and shipping, among other sectors. -Among the unsolicited bidders for Jet Airways is a consortium of minority investors led by a","Sep 4, 2019",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/latin-american-firm-is-newest-bidder-for-jet-airways-here-are-its-previous-suitors-4399481.html

In an effort to scrape together more cash before its slower winter season, the budget transatlantic carrier asked bondholders on Monday for up to a two-year extension in repaying two bonds about to reach maturity, which total about $380 million. As collateral, Norwegian is even offering up its landing slots at London's Gatwick Airport, a key element of its transatlantic business. If bondholders accept the revised debt plan, the airline will have until November of 2021 and February of 2022 to pay, rather than being forced to ante up this December and next August. It's not the first time Norwegian has been on the brink of going belly up—rumors of the airline's impending bankruptcy have been swirling since last year. ""Their earnings have been deteriorating for years,"" says aviation expert Seth Kaplan. ""This is a tough time of year in terms of cash generation,"" Kaplan says, noting that the airline has entered into a tight part of the year's cashflow cycle after busy summer season. The airline, which exploded in popularity by offering flights between Europe and U.S. cities on the East Coast for as little as $99 one-way, is one of the fastest growing airlines ever. Beginning its low-cost operations in 2002, Norwegian aggressively expanded its route network and shelled out the majority of its money on new planes in an effort to become the go-to airline for cheap flights across the Atlantic. But those new planes have added unexpected additional costs to Norwegian's already tight cash flow. Many of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners have had to be grounded for engine repairs, while its 18 Boeing 737 Max planes have also been affected by the worldwide grounding that began in March. The airline says these two issues have cost it about $166 million USD so far this year. Throughout 2019, Norwegian has sold off aircraft and cut routes to successfully raise more cash, but even those moves might not be enough to shore up its bottomline.

hristmas might not be so merry for Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) this year. Although it's expecting another record holiday season, with some analysts predicting it will account for 45% of all e-commerce sales, there is pressure building up behind its delivery operations that could force it to the breaking point. Amazon is pushing next-day delivery through its Prime membership program just as it has lost FedEx (NYSE: FDX) as an air and ground delivery service, while the air cargo fleet operators that it uses for Amazon Air are bogged down in union contract negotiations that show few signs of being resolved. There is little margin for error this Christmas, but Amazon's delivery capabilities may be stretched to the maximum, and any deviation from precision could cause a major upheaval. Atlas Air's labor relations could spoil Amazon's holidays. Image source: Atlas Air Worldwide. Pilots for both Atlas Air Worldwide (NASDAQ: AAWW) and Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG) have been working without a contract for several years.  While Air Transport Services Group hasn't had disruptions caused by its pilots union, and is expected to begin arbitration proceedings this month, Atlas Air's labor relations have been more contentious. The problem stretches back to its 2016 acquisition of Southern Air and the union wanting to negotiate a contract first before merging pilot seniority lists between the two airlines, believing it gave Atlas too much leverage in negotiations. Atlas argues that the union is undermining its ability to negotiate a contract by being intractable, and says that weaker second-quarter earnings ""were impacted by labor-related service disruptions."" It had to go to court to get an injunction this summer to have the union stop pushing mass sick-outs, fatigue calls, and dubious mechanical issues. During its earnings conference call, Atlas said the disruptions were ongoing despite the injunction and were costing it money as flights were delayed and it had to move crews around to fill slots. Amazon has taken a dim view of the recurring problems, telling the news site Business Insider earlier this year: We are disappointed with the current state of relations between Atlas and their pilot union. Neither side seems willing to work toward a reasonable compromise. This is contrary to the interests of Atlas, the pilots, and the customers they both serve. Amazon suggests the union is needlessly creating discord, noting, ""We repeatedly hear claims made by the union regarding Atlas's","Sep 3, 2019",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-may-have-airline-troubles-over-the-holidays-2019-09-03

BT newsletters. TRANSPORT. Airports advised"," Beijing CHINA'S top three airlines are bracing for a further margin squeeze as softer travel demand pressures passenger yields and a weakening yuan currency inflates costs, analysts said, as many of them slashed their annual profit forecasts for the carriers. The outlook revision - for which analysts also cited an economic slowdown amid a US-China trade war and fears of rising oil prices - comes after China Southern Airlines, Air China and China Eastern Airlines turned in lower net profits for the January-June period last week, erasing first-quarter gains. China Southern, the country's largest carrier by passenger numbers, posted a 20.9 per cent year-on-year drop in profit to 1.69 billion yuan (S$327 million), while China Eastern posted a 14.9 per cent drop to 1.94 billion yuan.   Air China, the country's flagship carrier, saw a smaller 9.5 per cent drop in net profit to 3.14 billion yuan due to positive returns from its investment in Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, which swung to its first profit for the January-June period since 2016.

Email us at btuserfeedback@sph.com.sg  Passenger yields, a measure of average fare per kilometre flown, fell for all three airlines, with China Southern suffering the steepest decline of 1.65 per cent from a year earlier. ""With the expectation that trade talks will continue for the rest of 2019, we expect a decline in the yield to continue, resulting in a total 2.3 per cent drop for the full year,"" Ivan Su, an equity analyst at Morningstar, said of China Southern. Cargo demand is also expected to stay soft, as a protracted trade war between the world's two biggest economies continues to disrupt global supply chains and rattle markets. Refinitiv data shows average full-year earnings estimates for all three carriers have been lowered over the past 30 days, ranging from a 5.3 per cent drop for China Eastern to a 13.3 per cent fall for China Southern. The forecast cuts come as the Chinese currency yuan has lost more than 3 per cent of its value against the dollar since Aug 1, when US President Donald Trump announced plans to slap more tariffs on Chinese goods. A few days later, Chinese authorities allowed the tightly managed currency to breach the key","Sep 3, 2019",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/transport/chinas-top-3-airlines-brace-for-smaller-profits
