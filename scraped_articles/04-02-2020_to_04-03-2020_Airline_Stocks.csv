1,American Airlines coronavirus downgrade: Airline stock 2020 outlook,"These two airlines are ‘too big to fail,’ investor says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Airline stocks are under serious pressure. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), which tracks the group, lost over 11% on Wednesday amid worries about the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on travel. Shares of JetBlue and American Airlines fell more than 9% and 12%, respectively. Earlier Wednesday, Stifel downgraded both stocks to hold from buy on concerns that airlines could pause flights for some time during the summer travel season. As airline executives rush to find solutions to stem the debilitating losses, which may include consolidating flights to certain cities, strategist Mark Tepper said he still has hope for some stocks in the group. “Both Delta and United, those are the two most critical airlines for our country. So, they are too big to fail,” Tepper said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” Still, he warned, companies “on the receiving end of bailouts” during crises don’t usually see their stocks outperform in the long run. He noted that financial stocks underperformed the S&P 500 by roughly 4% per year from October 2008 to December 2019. Delta’s stock lost over 16% in Wednesday’s trade. Shares of United fell nearly 19%. Both stocks were up more than 3% in Thursday’s premarket. “If I had to pick one, I would go with Delta,” said Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners. “With Delta, you have no 737 Max exposure, so, we can take that problem off the table for them,” he said. “They’ve got the best maintenance team in the business, and that good maintenance team really helps them to extend the useful life of all of their aircraft, which obviously ramps up their profitability. And they’ve got the best partnership out there, the gold-standard loyalty program partnership with American Express, which fortunately continues to deliver money to them right now in these tough times.” In the same interview, MKM Partners chief market technician JC O’Hara pointed to some promising action in a chart of the JETS ETF. “Heading into February, this ETF was trading right around 30, and then the February weakness struck the entire market and ... JETS was basically cut in half,” O’Hara said.  Now that JETS has started to show signs of consolidation, it’s worth asking: “Is this consolidation within the context of a greater bear market, meaning ... we have another leg lower? Or is this consolidation the start of a basing pattern?” O’Hara said. While he felt it","Apr 2, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/american-airlines-coronavirus-downgrade-airline-stock-2020-outlook.html

3,Stock Market Wrap-Up: Will Coronavirus Aid Crush Airline Stocks? | The Motley Fool,Stock Market Wrap-Up: Will Coronavirus Aid Crush Airline Stocks?. The broader market moved lower Friday.. Today's stock market. Losing altitude.,"   The stock market suffered significant losses on Friday, as coronavirus concerns continued to hurt investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) didn't quite give back all of its gains from Thursday, but market participants seemed reluctant to show much optimism heading into the weekend. Losses for the Dow, S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) were between 1% and 2%. Index Percentage Change (Decline) Point Change Dow (1.69%) (361) S&P 500 (1.51%) (38) Nasdaq Composite (1.53%) (114) DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. The coronavirus pandemic has hit the entire global economy hard, but few industries have taken it on the chin harder than airlines. Lawmakers made federal aid available through the stimulus bill, and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) officially stated earlier that they'll file applications for grants by the 5 p.m. EDT deadline today. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) are likely to follow suit. Yet even with that help, some airline stocks have continued to fall as the full ramifications of taking government help aren't entirely clear. American shares fell 7% Friday, slipping below the $10 mark as investors weighed the airline's latest moves. American is cutting its international flight schedule by 90% in April and May, with expectations that it will reduce peak summer capacity by 60%. Domestic flight schedules will take big hits, too, including 70% to 75% of flights in April and 80% in May. The moves follow extensions of stay-at-home orders throughout an increasing number of states. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP. To help it keep workers on its payroll, American has filed for its share of $25 billion that the federal government set aside in the coronavirus stimulus bill. Hoping to get about $6 billion, American likely faces draconian moves with its workforce without the assistance. Southwest also said earlier this week that it would file an application before the deadline to discuss federal assistance grants. The Texas-based carrier, whose shares dropped 3% Friday, is one of several airlines that have turned to transporting cargo in what would otherwise be empty flights. Yet it's clear from the tone of the airlines that they're less than excited about having to ask for help. As Southwest put it, it's filing an application ""to discuss the specific details regarding possible grants that could boost liquidity and provide job security."" That signals that whether it actually accepts the","Apr 3, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/03/stock-market-wrap-up-will-coronavirus-aid-crush-ai.aspx
4,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. Current news provides no reason for investors to get excited about these stocks.. What,"   Airline shares remained under pressure on Thursday, continuing a downward spiral that saw many large companies lose more than one-third of their value in March. Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) led the march downward on Thursday, falling nearly 10% early in the day, while shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) were both down more than 6%. The airlines have been among the sectors hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with demand for travel all but evaporating overnight. The carriers have responded by cutting flights and grounding airplanes, but no amount of cost reductions can offset a steep decline in revenue. The industry got some help late in March when the government came through with $50 billion in support, but that capital only buys time and will not be enough if demand does not quickly return. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. American, United, and Spirit are all seen as particularly vulnerable to a downturn, but for different reasons. American has the highest debt load in the industry, which in past cycles has been a recipe for disaster heading into a recession. United has more Asian operations than most of its U.S. rivals, and with hubs in Houston and San Francisco is exposed to falling crude prices and the potential deflation of a Silicon Valley bubble. Spirit is a fringe carrier with total debt more than four times EBITDA, and might not be top of mind for lawmakers if Washington is required to provide further assistance to the industry. For now, the airlines are doing all they can to build their cash reserves. American said in a regulatory filing late Wednesday that it had tapped three different revolving credit facilities to add a total of $2.73 billion in fresh cash to its balance sheet. There's no easy way out for the airlines right now, and at the very least the next few quarters are going to be ugly. I remain hopeful that the pandemic will be contained in the months to come and air traffic will rebound to at least normal recessionary levels. But even if that happens, it is going to take until 2021 at least for these stocks to really take off. Of the three stocks listed above, Spirit is the one with the highest risk (and the highest potential reward) for investors, but the risk should not be underestimated.

5,Should You Buy Airline Stocks? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Should You Buy Airline Stocks?. Air Canada. Cargojet. Two New Stock Picks,"      Amy Legate-Wolfe | April 3, 2020 | More on: AC CJT The airline industry is in a tailspin of epic proportions. Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, airlines were grounded around the world to stop the spread of the virus. Canada may only be in the beginning of this terrible pandemic, with many more months to go potentially before the end is near. It’s leaving Canadians with two problems on their minds: health and money. While I’m not the best resource when it comes to providing health advice (please visit the World Health Organization for health guidelines), I can give you a heads up for at least one industry. Airline companies such as Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) and Cargojet (TSX:CJT) are two Canadian airline stocks that have been getting a lot of attention during this economic downturn, and both have seen major plummets in the last month, with a return to normalcy nowhere in sight. Today I’m going to focus on these two companies to give you a broader look on whether now is the time to buy airline stocks — or wait until the chaos subsides. Air Canada had an amazing run up until recently. The stock hit an all-time high of $52.71 per share back in January, with many analysts still believing that this stock would keep going strong. However, as Fool writer Joey Frenette mentioned back then, as the pandemic began to climb, it looked like that was the time to sell. Unfortunately, he was right. Air Canada and others in the airline industry plummeted, but Air Canada saw a fall not witnessed since 2009, when the stock dropped to under a dollar per share. It would be three years before there was any signs of life in the stock. Since then, Air Canada has become the number one airline in the country. While there are some that fear the company could go bankrupt, it’s doubtful. When coronavirus is in the rear-view mirror, Air Canada will be the first in the airline industry in Canada to come back from the brink. Granted, it is likely to report a loss or two in the next year. However, over the long term, the company has set itself up to take on every area of the airline industry: low-cost airfares, business savvy, efficient planes, and increased global stops. So when the economy takes off, you can bet","Apr 3, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/03/should-you-buy-airline-stocks/
6,European Airline stocks face multi-billion revenue losses as travel bans continue,European Airline stocks face multi-billion revenue losses as travel bans continue. Airline stocks after coronavirus. Airline Stocks to Watch. British,"European airlines are facing one of the most challenging scenarios of their history. Coronavirus cases and deaths in Italy, Spain, Germany and France top the list of countries with the highest number of cases worldwide with a total of nearly 300,000 (combined) so far. Most of these countries have already imposed severe halts to traveling including air space restrictions, flight bans and border control. Italy has gone as far as declaring a complete countrywide lockdown until April 3. As a result, airline stocks have been dramatically impacted, as illustrated by the STOXX® Europe Total Market Airlines index, which has lost nearly 54 per cent of its value since the coronavirus stock market crash of February 20. On an individual basis, British Airways (IAG), EasyJet (EZJ), and Lufthansa (LHA), which are among the largest operators in the continent, have lost 63 per cent, 37 per cent, and 56 per cent respectively. Smaller operators have already announced that they may be forced out of business if the halts continue for more than two or three months. Regulators and governments have already stepped in to avoid an industry-wide crisis. Among the most important airline stock news there’s the recent $2trn US government bailout that was approved by Congress to assist US businesses that have been significantly embattled by the situation. Moreover, European governments have also announced their efforts to assist businesses in surviving the crisis. So far world leaders have pledged nearly $7trn to this effort, even though some countries, such as the UK, are still reluctant to issue specific aid for airlines. Certain regulators and industry associations have already warned the public about the disastrous consequences that a no-bailout scenario could have for airlines in Europe. The Center for Aviation, an Australia-based industry information provider, has reported that “By the end of May 2020, most airlines in the world will be bankrupt” if governments fail to step in to help. Thousands of jobs could be on the line if such a catastrophe does occur. While certain major airlines have anticipated these black-swan situations and have prepared their finances to withstand the blow, smaller players are in no position to survive. Ever since the coronavirus market crash of February 20, airlines stocks, along with shares of other tourism businesses, have been among the biggest losers, as capacity cuts within European airlines are now ranging from 70 per cent to 80 per cent and","Apr 3, 2020",https://capital.com/airlines-stocks-after-coronavirus
7,Why Airline Stocks May Never Fully Recover,"Why Airline Stocks May Never Fully Recover. The airline industry is one of the hardest hit by the current pandemic,","It has not been a good year for airlines. Here’s a quick recap of the major U.S. carriers performance year-to-date: When a company has lost 42% of its valuation in three months and is leading the pack, you know the industry is in trouble. Demand for travel has plummeted and airlines are grounding the majority of their flights, with the ones that are still flying only taking a fraction of what they would usually. Stats show passenger numbers are at 8% of the same time last year, with revenue even less than that due to reduced prices.  In case you missed it: The industry is hemorrhaging billions of dollars at a fast clip and has had to look to the government for a bailout in the form of $25 billion in direct grants and another $25 billion in loans. The grants are premised on the airlines keeping their employees on the payroll and maintaining service in airports in which they serve. This bailout will work to stem the flow of blood, but a fast recovery is not on the cards. The coronavirus has enveloped the industry in unpredictability, with discretionary travel being one of the last steps on the path back to normality.  However, normality will ensue. It may take quite a while, but it will, and investors may eye up the downtrodden airlines as a way of making a quick buck on their return to former glory. If you invested in United at its 52-week low and it recovered to its 52-week high, you would nab yourself a 5-bagger. It’s been there before, it can get there again, right? There is one big caveat to this, and it’s the reason why airlines may never fully recover from the effects of this pandemic.  Business travel is going to be one of the biggest long-term corporate casualties of the coronavirus. It is a relic of times gone by and one which was slowly being gnawed away at by more modern, forward-thinking companies already. Services like Slack (NYSE:WORK), Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams ensure the efficacy of remote working and turn face-to-face meetings into a luxury rather than a necessity. As businesses around the world are forced to adapt in order to maintain operations and working from home becomes the new norm, the use of these types of technologies has been ramped up.

But quite frankly every airline in the world is facing the same issue. Demand for their services is essentially zero. And it will be for the foreseeable future. That’s not the headline story for AAL stock.  In no way do I mean to imply that the pandemic is not a serious event. But like other “Black Swan” events, it has put the entire industry on pause. And because all airlines face the same short-term consequences, it can be easy to think that every airline will benefit from a resurgence of consumer demand. However the real problem for AAL stock is one of math. Unlike many of its counterparts, the company was not showing robust growth before the novel coronavirus pandemic. And that was in the middle of an unparalleled economic expansion. The prudent investor knows that the industry will come back. And that’s why you have to look at the health of the company before the outbreak. Those companies will be in the best position to recover quickly. Unfortunately, American cannot make that claim. American Airlines came into 2020 with $29.6 billion of adjusted net debt. That was 65% of the company’s 2019 revenue. Of the major airlines, including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), American is the one that can least afford to go further into debt.

-0.41%. S&P 500
-0.35%. NASDAQ 100
-0.07%. Airline salaries compared to stock buybacks show why so many people are angry at","  Following is a transcript of the video. Narrator: Earlier this month, Airlines for America, a trade group representing the major US airlines, asked the federal government for $50 billion in assistance ""to protect and preserve the 750,000 jobs of hardworking men and women who are directly employed by U.S. airlines."" This set up a heated showdown. There's the industry, which says it's in desperate need of financial help, and then there are elected officials and activists, who say the airlines would not be in this position if they did not spend so much of their money on stock buybacks, which a lot of people see as the companies lining the pockets of shareholders over all else. Buybacks are often used as a way to boost a company's stock price. The repurchases shrink shares outstanding, which increases the value of the remaining units. They're frequently viewed as a signal from management that the stock is attractively priced. So, we're going to take a look at the airlines' own data to help explain why people are so mad about this bailout. Let's start with American Airlines. It's the biggest airline in the US and reported having almost 134,000 employees in 2019. Let's take a moment here to watch the amount American paid in salary, wages, and benefits grow over the last 10 years. Now, it dips a little in 2013, but let's not focus on that. Instead, take a look at the end point here. In 2019, American reported paying all of its employees a grand total of $12.6 billion. Now let's add another line. This is the amount American spent on its share-buyback program, which just means money used to buy back its own stock. It's a move that financially engineers share-price gains, which enriches shareholders. This didn't start happening until 2014, when the company spent just over $1 billion on its stock. Its buyback program shot up for the next couple of years before coming back down and staying around the $1 billion mark. So, we've got a billion here, almost $4 billion here, $4.5 billion here, add this, and this, carry the one, and if you add it all up, American has spent $12.9 billion over the last six years on its own stock. People are mad because $12.6 billion is what it cost to pay the employees' salaries for an entire year, and if you add","Apr 3, 2020",https://www.businessinsider.com/airline-stock-buybacks-versus-employee-compensation-2020-4

The filings did not say why Buffett’s firm opted to sell stock. Congressional lawmakers passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package last month that included financial relief for U.S. airlines. The measures helped airlines avoid significant layoffs in the short term. However, airline executives have warned in recent days that business is unlikely to improve any time soon. In a letter to employees published Friday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the airline is burning more than $60 million per day and expected second-quarter revenue to be down by 90 percent.

(opens in a new window) Stocks fell in regular trading Friday, as all major American indices fell in the wake of a broadly negative jobs report. With more than 700,000 jobs lost in the March data, unemployment in the United States rose from 3.5% to 4.4%. The markets have been bracing for widespread job losses due to the continued fallout from COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus that has prompted local, county and state officials throughout the U.S. and Europe to issue stay-at-home orders. Those directives have forced bars, restaurants, gyms and other non-essentials businesses to close. While the market had expected a wave of job losses, stocks fell as those figures surpassed expectations. Selloffs were further spurred by this troubling recognition: Friday’s figures only account for unemployment-insurance claims individuals filed in the first two weeks of March, before most of the COVID-related layoffs began. This was unlike Thursday, when negative data led to market gains. Here are the day’s raw results: Shares of SaaS and cloud companies tracked by the Bessemer cloud index fell as well, while cryptocurrencies were roughly flat in the 24-hour period ending with the close of equity trading. There were standouts, however. Shares of Tesla held onto some of their after-hours gains recorded yesterday, closing the day up 5.62% to close at $408.01 as the company continued to ride its positive report that it had delivered more vehicles than expected. Bill.com, a recent SaaS IPO, managed gains as well, closing the day up 2.71%. It was somewhat hard to find exceptions to the selloff; most companies lost ground in the face of worse-than-expected economic data. Every sector saw downward pressure Friday, with the exception of energy and consumer products, which saw a bit of a lift. Oil futures had one of its best days on record, after Russian President Vladimir Putin said global cuts of around 10 million barrels a day are possible. Airlines were also hit Friday after the U.S. Department of Transportation ordered the industry to provide refunds on any flights that companies had canceled. While airline stocks recovered, they all closed in negative territory. United Airlines fell 2.28% to close at $22.88, American Airlines declined 6.8% to $9.38 and Delta Airlines dropped 0.88% to $22.48.   See all newsletters
