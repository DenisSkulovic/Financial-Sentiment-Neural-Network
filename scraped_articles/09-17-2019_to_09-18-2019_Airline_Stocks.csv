[+] The weekend attack on Saudi Arabia’s critically important Abqaiq oil refining plant and storage facility sent oil prices higher on global markets while big oil users like the airlines and the big shipping and cruise lines saw their stocks fall in anticipation of higher pump prices and negative impact on consumer spending. Both West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude, the two most widely traded grades of oil, rose more that 13% in trading on world markets Monday. WTI closed at $62.36, up 13.69% or $7.51 a barrel. Brent closed at $68.67, up 14.03% or $8.45 a barrel. Those are the highest closing prices since May. The highest prices in the last 12 months came in the first week of October 2018, when WTI topped $75 a barrel. But throughout the summer oil prices hovered in the $55 - $60 range per barrel. During early trading on Monday airlines were hit hard, as they nearly always are whenever events impacting the flow of oil from the Middle East or the United States occur.  U.S. carriers’ stocks started off down around 10% on Monday. But, most of them staged a bit of a comeback in the afternoon to finish off down only around 3% or less on the day. One U.S. airline – Southwest - even managed to finish in positive territory, barely, at $55.81 a share, up two cents on the session. Shares of major international carriers mostly followed a similar trading path on Monday, rebounding in the afternoon to close mostly in the -3% range.

1,"United Airlines, Southwest stocks could be ready to rally, trader says","These two airline stocks could be ready to rally, trader says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Airlines stocks are under pressure. Major airlines American, United, JetBlue and Delta lost altitude Monday after a weekend attack on Saudi Arabia sent oil prices soaring, giving Brent crude its largest intraday move ever. Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures, says this is the time to buy on weakness. “Seasonally, this is when you want to be looking to buy airline stocks,” Baruch said Monday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “That’s because crude oil peaks in September, October and over the last 20 years has averaged from peak to trough about an 8% sell-off, and this brings a good support to airlines. So, I’m not saying the top in crude oil is here right now, but we could see crude oil top around $65 to $66 [per barrel], and that again is going to be supportive to airlines.” Crude oil would need to rally another 5% to reach the low end of that range. Baruch is eyeing two names in the group that he says have strong trend lines. “First, I’m looking at United Airlines. It’s out above the 50- and 200-day moving average. We could see a move up to a trend line resistance up around $95 to $96.50,” he said.  United has outperformed the market recently, climbing 7% in the past month, while the S&P 500 has rallied nearly 4%. Baruch’s second pick, Southwest, has done even better with a 12% jump since August. “Southwest is about to see the 50-day moving average cross out above the 200-day. It’s held the trend line support, and then that could really bring a tailwind moving it up to somewhere in the ballpark of $60 to that trend line resistance. So I think these are opportunities to buy,” said Baruch.  Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management, disagrees. “In our work, they don’t look terribly cheap. We look at relative price-to-sales ratio. We had owned the group a couple years back and, actually, they got into our sell ranges and we got out,” she said. She looks to another angle in the sector. “We’ve been expressing our commitment to the space through the couriers like Fedex and UPS, who frankly are not down much today, and we’ve got earnings with Fedex tomorrow,” Tengler said in the same interview Monday. UPS and FedEx have climbed 6% and 11% over the past month, respectively.

4,Why Southwest Airlines Is Shrugging Off the Oil Price Spike (but American Airlines Isn't) | The Motley Fool,Why Southwest Airlines Is Shrugging Off the Oil Price Spike (but American Airlines Isn't). Southwest Airlines' high profit margin and,"   Oil prices skyrocketed on Monday after a drone attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels -- likely with the support of Iran -- took more than half of Saudi Arabia's production offline. This put pressure on the U.S. stock market, with airline stocks hit particularly hard as jet fuel prices followed oil higher. However, the impact wasn't felt evenly across all airlines. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock actually inched up slightly on Monday, whereas shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) plunged 7%. Here's why rising oil prices pose a much bigger threat to American Airlines than to its crosstown rival.  SOUTHWEST AIRLINES VS. AMERICAN AIRLINES STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. Last weekend's drone attacks won't impact the oil market's balance very much. Saudi Arabia is already restarting production at some oil fields that had been idle recently and should be able to recover completely within a few months -- or even within weeks. Meanwhile, global oil inventories are high and OPEC production cuts over the past year mean that other countries also have spare production capacity available. Nevertheless, oil prices are incorporating a bigger risk premium in light of the recent attack. This reflects the possibility of retaliation by Saudi Arabia and its allies, the potential for similar attacks on Saudi production in the future, and the risk of an all-out regional war. The Brent crude spot price surged nearly 15% to around $69 per barrel on Monday, which would boost the price of jet fuel by about $0.20 per gallon. (Prices retreated somewhat on Tuesday.) This would represent a nearly 10% increase in jet fuel prices compared to what Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have been paying recently. On the other hand, the recent Brent crude price of $69 per barrel is far below the $100-plus prices seen routinely between 2011 and mid-2014. Furthermore, oil prices are still lower than they were a year ago, so airlines should be able to make plenty of money even if the recent jump in oil prices sticks. Investors correctly identified American Airlines as perhaps the biggest victim of the oil price spike. First, unlike Southwest Airlines, American hasn't done any fuel hedging for many years. As a result, it is fully exposed to the recent increase in prices. THE RECENT SPIKE IN OIL PRICES COULD PINCH AMERICAN AIRLINES' PROFIT NEXT QUARTER. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES.

5,Can Alaska Air Stock Return to Triple-Digit Territory? | The Motley Fool,Can Alaska Air Stock Return to Triple-Digit Territory?. The West Coast airline is getting its mojo back after experiencing sharp,"   Shares of Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) rallied after the company made plans to acquire smaller rival Virgin America in 2016. The stock briefly surpassed the $100 mark in early 2017, a few months after the merger closed. However, it didn't last. While the technical process of merging the two airlines went smoothly, it was more difficult to win over Virgin America loyalists to the Alaska Airlines brand. At the same time, the carrier faced rising fuel prices and stiffer competition in many of its markets. Alaska Air stock finally bottomed out earlier this year at just $53.39.  ALASKA AIRLINES STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. Since then, shares of the West Coast-focused airline have started to recover as Alaska Airlines' earnings growth has accelerated. If the company can hit its margin target while returning to a faster growth rate over the next two years, Alaska Air stock could soar more than 50% to surpass $100 again by 2021. In the first half of 2019, Alaska Air's adjusted earnings per share soared 29% year over year to $2.34, driven by a strong 3.9% increase in revenue per available seat mile (RASM), solid nonfuel cost performance, and a slight decline in fuel prices. Management expects a similar level of unit revenue growth in the third quarter, with its current guidance calling for a 3% to 5% RASM increase. It faces more pressure on nonfuel unit costs, largely due to new labor contracts ratified this quarter, offset by a bigger year-over-year drop in fuel prices. Analysts currently expect EPS of $2.22 this quarter, up 16% year over year. The outlook for the fourth quarter is even brighter. Whereas nonfuel unit costs are on track to rise about 5% in the third quarter, Alaska Airlines' Q4 outlook calls for a 1.2% decline in nonfuel unit costs. And with oil prices already moderating -- after surging on Monday following drone attacks that temporarily knocked out about half of Saudi Arabia's production -- Alaska is likely to pay significantly less for jet fuel next quarter than the $2.35 per gallon average price it paid in the fourth quarter of 2018. This sets the stage for Alaska's earnings growth to accelerate further in Q4. Indeed, analysts are calling for EPS to skyrocket 79% year over year to $1.34 next quarter, putting Alaska Air's full-year adjusted EPS at $5.90, up 32% from $4.46 last year.

8,Insider Trading 911. Raises Questions | by Tantra Bensko | Medium,Sign in. You have 1 free member-only story left this month. Sign up for Medium and get an extra one.,"Many people still believe the official theory of 911, though evidence of international insider trading is one of many elements undermining it. The 911 Commission refuted insider trading related to terrorism and some very trusting people believe that report. What people are most aware of is how on September 6th, 2001, put-option volume in United Airlines stock was 100 times higher than normal: 2,000 options versus twenty seven on the previous day. Rather than the expected equal ratio of put to call, instead it was twelve to one. However, this could be largely the result of a few traders going by recommendations for a newsletter. We can’t necessarily say the unusually high trading in “put options” on American Airline and United Airlines, before 9/11, gambling that the share prices would lower, were evidence of foreknowledge, because the stock market could have shown instead simply a response to some bad news released by the American Airlines shortly before and United was also already falling. The anomaly is still interesting to look into, even if we let it go as proof. However, dismissal of that is not enough to discredit the overall insider trading evidence that’s much larger than that one aspect. And the CIA is not looking good here. The “unclaimed millions” is another fact people point to as evidence that the person who should have cashed in was afraid of being caught for insider trading. We have no way of knowing the reason a person had for not claiming money made from such trauma. But again, even if we discount that blip, there is plenty to point to the potential insider trading by Intelligence agency related insurance companies, banks, and much more. Heightened investments speculating a lowering in value of Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch investment firms, which were devastated on 911, is one of the many suspicious events. Check out issues regarding gold, oil, Raytheon weapons, WTC securities, Comverse, and the destruction of evidence of insider trading as well as its cover-up by the 911 Commission Report and the media.

9,5 Unusual ETFs to Wrap Your Head Around | Nasdaq,5 Unusual ETFs to Wrap Your Head Around. Direxion Russell 1000 Value Over Growth ETF (RWVG). Global X Internet of," As the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) industry has grown and evolved, so have the number of offerings that can be considered unique, unusual or downright odd. It’s safe to say that prosaic, will always be the kings of the castle, but there are plenty of unusual ETFs that investors may want to investigate, too. And just because it’s an unusual ETF doesn’t mean it’s a bad fund. On the other hand, unusual ETFs dedicated to obscure commodities, those that focus on isolated age demographics or those that have such complex methodologies you’d need to be a CFA to understand them probably are not applicable to most investors. Here are some unusual ETFs that are certainly interesting and applicable for use by a wider audience than some of the really oddball stuff out there.  Source: Shutterstock  Expense ratio: 0.46% per year, or $46 on a $10,000 investment. The Direxion Russell 1000 Value Over Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:), which debuted in January, is a long/short fund. That on its own doesn’t make it an unusual ETF because there are dozens of such products on the market. What makes RWVW (and its stablemates) unique is that its long/short strategy pertains directly to specific investment factors, in this case value and growth. RWVG targets the Russell 1000 Value/Growth 150/50 Net Spread Index. That’s a mouthful of an index name, so let’s put it is objective in simple terms: RWVG has 150% long component and a 50% short portion to arrive at net long exposure of 100%. Essentially, this unusual ETF is overweight some of the primary tenants of the Russell 1000 Value index, such as financial services, healthcare and energy stocks. Those sectors combine for nearly two-thirds of RWVG’s roster. What makes this unusual ETF worth a gander right now, in addition to its concept being relatively straight forward, is that value stocks are finally showing after a lengthy slumber. It’s possible for value and growth stocks to rise in unison, but this time around, many market observers believe value’s redemption will come at the expense of growth and that could make RWVG’s long/short methodology all the more potent.  Source: Shutterstock  Expense ratio: 0.68% The Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:) isn’t the most unusual ETF on the market, but it focuses on a still nascent investment and does the fit the bill as a thematic fund.

11,Price Rigging Definition,Price Rigging. What Is Price Rigging?. KEY TAKEAWAYS. How Price Rigging Works. Example of Price Rigging. Price Rigging and Regulation.,"Price rigging is an illegal action that occurs when parties conspire to fix or inflate prices to achieve higher profits at the expense of the consumer. Also known as ""price fixing"" or ""collusion,"" price rigging can take place in any industry. Cases of price rigging may be prosecuted under the antitrust laws of several different countries, as it runs contrary to natural market forces (such as supply and demand). It has the effect of dampening competition, which tends to favor the consumer with greater variety and lower prices. Price rigging is a form of market manipulation. As a term, ""price rigging"" is most commonly used in British English, while ""price fixing"" is more common in North America. While most cases of price rigging involve a conspiracy to keep prices as high as possible, is may also be employed to keep prices stable, fix them, or discount them. Price rigging may take many forms: manufacturers and sellers may seek to set pricing floors, agree to a common minimum price or book price, limit discounting or markups, agree to impose or limit similar surcharges, or carve up territories or customer bases to limit competition within them. Price rigging is tolerated in certain businesses and locales. Price rigging may be found in a variety of industries, though it is not always illegal. Airline ticket prices and oil prices are fixed by the IATA and OPEC, respectively, for example. Price rigging may be used by traders to artificially inflate the price of a stock to lure in more investors. As new investors buy up shares, share prices increase in value until the manipulators sell off, which causes share prices to collapse. OTC Bulletin Board shares, also known as penny stocks, are especially vulnerable to price rigging. In the United States, price rigging is defined and prohibited in the Sherman Antitrust Act (of 1890) as a federal offense. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over civil price fixing cases, and some states also prosecute price rigging antitrust cases, but most regulation is by the United States Department of Justice. In Canada, price rigging is a criminal act under Section 45 of the Competition Act. In the United Kingdom, the Office of Fair Trading regulates price rigging, which has been approved for the distribution of newspapers and magazines (retailers who sell periodicals below their cover price may have their supply cut off).

Head of Investment Research The unpresented hard landing in the global aviation industry demonstrates the significant impact and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic in the entire airline space. According to official travel data, more than 40 commercial airlines have already bankrupted or suspended their operations in 2020 so far, failing to survive the worst financial crisis in aviation history. The next few months will be rocky for the airlines as coronavirus cases have risen in the U.S. and Europe at their highest level since summer. Many countries have already reinstated tougher social distancing rules and rolled back previews re-opening measures to curb the spread of the virus, creating a negative dynamic for the aviation industry once again. Stock performance: The shares of some major US carriers such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), and American Airlines (AAL) have lost more than 50% of their market value this year so far, contrasting with gains of 50% for the tech-related Nasdaq 100 Composite and 10% for the S&P 500 index. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines delivered misses on third quarter-Q3 revenues that dropped at least 75% year-over-year, which was largely reliable with the drop in airport traffic observed during summer, low passenger revenues, and large operating costs. Government support: Governments around the world have minimized the damage in the aviation industry by supporting the carriers from going bankrupt during the first months of the pandemic. The industry’s revenues had been hit so hard from the pandemic-related lockdowns and the travel restrictions, that governments had no option but to support the carriers with billions of dollars to avoid layoffs. The official authorities together have provided more than $150 billion in support, including direct aid, wage subsidies, corporate tax relief, and specific industry tax relief including fuel taxes. Thankfully for airlines, the financial aid does not add more debt to their balance sheets. The US administration is planning to provide a new $25 billion bailout for U.S. passenger airlines to keep tens of thousands of workers on the job for another six months. The new financial aid will extend the prior $25 billion airline payroll support program of mostly cash grants approved by Congress in March, which it expired on Sept. 30.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   I listened to Leon Cooperman’s talk at an event hosted by the New York Alternative Investment Roundtable. There were a few members of the media present at the event and they decided that the most interesting part of Cooperman’s talk was his comments regarding the private equity industry. “I think it’s a scam personally” Cooperman said. “The biggest factor in the success of the private equity in the last decade is the enormous decline in interest rates. That made the exit multiple much higher than the entry multiple. Anybody betting on lower interest rates from here is betting on depression. The odds are very high the interest rates will be going up over the next 5 to 10 years” Cooperman added. Obviously I didn’t attend this event to report on Cooperman’s private equity comments. I am interested in Cooperman’s market view as well as his best investment ideas. He has been consistently betting on a bull market over the last 10 years and I don’t think he predicted a recession or a bear market at any point over the last 10 years. So, Cooperman is a very reliable recession indicator in my opinion. Cooperman estimates that S&P 500 constituents will earn $168 this year and he puts a 17 multiple on that to reach 2890 for the S&P 500 Index. “I think the market is fairly valued. Not overvalued, not undervalued,” he said. He doesn’t think it is appropriate to use a higher multiple because of the ultra-low interest rate environment. He said he was very surprised how abruptly the economy slowed down during the fourth quarter of 2018 “in the face of very small interest rate increase”. This tells him that there is a corporate debt problem and it is getting worse, not better. “We have record high margins and margins tend to mean revert,” Cooperman added. Cooperman didn’t elaborate on this but it is clearly not a good idea to invest in highly leveraged companies or long-term bond ETFs like iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) going forward.

In,"Dobrolyot, or sometimes Dobrolet (English: ""volunteer""), is an initialism for Russian: Российское общество Добровольного воздушного флота - Добролёт (The Russian Society of Voluntary Air Fleet), an early Soviet Union air transport organisation, which was formed in 1923 and existed throughout the remainder of the 1920s. It was formed in imitation of the Russian Merchant Navy Volunteer Fleet (Dobroflot), which had previously been formed back in 1878.[1] The Dobrolyot society was created in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on March 17, 1923[2][3] to contribute to the development of the country's air fleet. A capital of two million gold rubles was authorised to fund its early projects and this was later augmented by funds derived from the issuance of stocks, which were initially offered to Soviet enterprises at the cost of one gold ruble a piece.[4] Those who bought 25,000 shares were given the right to use a plane from its fleet.[5] When a line between Moscow and Nijni-Novgorod was established, a daily service was arranged using nineteen Junker-type aeroplanes.[6] The basic objectives were the organisation of airmail, cargo and passenger lines, aviation related solutions of national economic problems (for example, aerial photography of localities) and also the development of the domestic aircraft industry. For example, Dobrolyot constructed airports and weather stations.[5] Territorially, activity of this organisation covered Russia and Central Asia. In 1929, Dobrolyot and the similar organisations of other Soviet republics Ukrpovitroshliach (Ukrainian Airways) and Zakavia (a Georgian Airline) were incorporated into Dobrolyot USSR. On October 29, 1930, Dobrolyot was abolished, forming the basis for the Central administration of the Civil air fleet (GU GVF), later becoming Aeroflot. Up until that time, the society's flight routes totaled 26,000 km in length; 47,000 passengers and 408 tonnes of cargo had been transported. In 1932, all civil aviation activities were consolidated under the name of Grazhdansky Vozdushny Flot (Civil Air Fleet), known as Aeroflot. In 1993, in Russia, the Dobrolyot Aviation Company JSC was created. It was operating cargo flights. ","Sep 18, 2019",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobrolyot
15,Norwegian Air Gets Crucial Backing on Debt Refinancing Deal | Fortune,Norwegian Air Gets Crucial Backing on Debt Refinancing Deal. Keeping business secure in the age of digital privacy. More must-read,"September 18, 2019 4:10 PM GMT+3         Norwegian Air was one of the few airline stocks this week to have weathered the Saudi Aramco oil crisis without the slightest turbulence. It can thank its bondholders for that. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the company announced that bondholders agreed to a two-year extension to pay back two unsecured bonds valued at $380 million. The backing was reached in a series of meetings with creditors on Monday. The airline needed a two-thirds majority of bondholders to agree to the more lenient payment terms on the separate bond tranches, the company’s two biggest. In the end, it secured 89.8% and 99.64% approval, respectively.  Shares of the low-cost carrier, Europe’s third largest, are up more than 16 percent over the past three trading days. Investors sent the stock soaring even as the rest of the aviation sector bottomed out as the price of crude oil took off in response to the attacks on Saudi Aramco’s oil processing facility over the weekend. “We’re pleased with the bondholders’ decision to amend the bonds as it will give us added financial headroom going forward,” said acting CEO and CFO, Geir Karlsen. “We believe it demonstrates faith in our strategy and support of the important measures Norwegian is undertaking to return to profitability. The company’s operational performance continues to improve, and we are on track to reach the targeted cost-reductions of two billion NOK in 2019.” Karlsen took over the helm this summer after founder and former CEO Bjoern Kjos stepped down. Investors had grown impatient with Kjos as the once high-flying company saw passenger numbers fall in the wake of the grounding in March of the Boeing 737 MAX, its workhorse passenger plane model. Norwegian responded by shutting down its fleet of 18 737 MAX planes, representing a vital piece of its growing route business. In a move that took effect this week, it was forced to suspend flights between three airports in Ireland and three North American destinations: New York Stewart, Providence, RI, and Hamilton, Ontario. The Boeing 737 MAX saga has disrupted much of the airline sector. Ryanair, Europe’s No. 2 airline, warned investors this summer that the uncertainty about the availability of the 737 MAX would cut into its growth projections and that it would be forced to scale back operations at unspecified airports and","Sep 18, 2019",https://fortune.com/2019/09/18/norwegian-air-crucial-backing-debt-refinancing/
16,"Is United Airlines Holdings, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:UAL) P/E Ratio Really That Good? - Simply Wall St News","Is United Airlines Holdings, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:UAL) P/E Ratio Really That Good?. How Do You Calculate United Airlines Holdings's P/E Ratio?.","This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). To keep it practical, we'll show how United Airlines Holdings, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:UAL) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. United Airlines Holdings has a price to earnings ratio of 9.11, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 11.0%. See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings The formula for P/E is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for United Airlines Holdings: P/E of 9.11 = $89.98 ÷ $9.88 (Based on the year to June 2019.) A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price. The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that United Airlines Holdings has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the airlines industry average (9.2). That indicates that the market expects United Airlines Holdings will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. When earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down. United Airlines Holdings increased earnings per share by a whopping 38% last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 39%. So we'd generally expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio. But earnings per share are down 19% per year over the last three years. The market might expect further growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares. The 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth. Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here","Sep 18, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-ual/united-airlines-holdings/news/is-united-airlines-holdings-inc-s-nasdaqual-p-e-ratio-really-that-good
17,Southwest Airlines upgraded after revamp of corporate travel arm - Dallas Business Journal,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"Southwest Airlines expects to see between a $10 million to $20 million bump next year when improvements to its corporate travel arm come online.

Employees See full profile A major revamp of a key segment for Southwest Airlines has caught the eye of some analysts. Macquarie Capital upgraded Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) last week from neutral to outperform along with low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines Inc. (Nasdaq: SAVE). One of the big reasons for the upgrade is Southwest expects to benefit from a $10 million to $20 million bump in the second half of 2020 when improvements to its corporate travel arm, renamed Southwest Business, come online. The Dallas-based carrier expanded partnerships with global distribution systems that will provide travel managers more flexibility to make changes to itineraries. The move is expected to give Southwest ""a new growth platform with small to medium businesses,"" the note from Macquarie said. Elsewhere in the industry, stocks took a beating Monday after an attack on Saudi oil infrastructure over the weekend and rebounded Tuesday. Southwest is more insulated than competitors because of its fuel price hedging practices. Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures, pointed to the carrier, along with United Airlines Group (Nasdaq: UAL), as stocks to watch going forward. Southwest shares, which opened at $55.25 Tuesday, could end up ""in the ballpark of $60,"" Baruch said in a television interview with CNBC. ""I think these are opportunities to buy."" Despite being the largest operator of the 737 Max aircraft, which has been grounded since March, Southwest has been able to weather the grounding better than competitors.  Fort Worth-based American Airlines Group Inc. (Nasdaq: AAL) had one of its worst operational summers as it dealt with the 737 Max grounding and its ongoing labor dispute with its mechanics. Southwest's cancellation rate has declined throughout 2019 and for the last three months has been better than both American and United, trailing only the consistently steady Delta Air Lines Inc.
