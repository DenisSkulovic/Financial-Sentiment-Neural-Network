0,Goldman Sachs could be best way to play the financials rally,This top banking stock could be the best way to play the financials rally. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips.,"Financials have led the stock market rally over the past three months, marching back toward highs not seen since 2007. A lagging name could be the best way to play catch-up, according to Miller Tabak equity strategist Matt Maley. “Goldman Sachs — not only has the stock underperformed the broad market by quite a bit this year but it’s also underperformed the XLF [financial ETF],” Maley told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Monday. Goldman Sachs shares are up 8% in the past three months, weaker than the 11% advance on the XLF ETF and a similar move on the KBE bank ETF. However, the stock has bounced more than 20% from a summer low. “It could have a lot more upside if it can break even further,” Maley said. “The stock has already broken above its trend line going back to last year, its one-year trend line, that’s very positive. Now it’s bumping up against its highs that came in at $222.”  “If it could break above the $222 level in any kind of meaningful way, that would follow that broken trendline with a higher high, so that would be very, very bullish,” Maley said. “That $222 level is also the topline of an ascending triangle pattern, so for two different reasons on a technical basis, if it can break above $222, it’s going to be incredibly bullish for the stock.” Goldman Sachs is just over 1% from reaching $222. It touched that level earlier this month.  John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, is bullish on the big banks as a group. “There’s value in the larger-cap money center banks. What have we learned over the past couple of weeks? The Fed has cut rates twice, and yet this group has rallied, and why is that? Well, I think they’ve diversified their business model enough where they’re not as sensitive to where interest rates were, say, maybe 10 or 20 years ago,” Petrides said during the same segment. The XLF ETF, which holds J.P. Morgan and Bank of America among its top components, has moved 4% higher this month. The broad-based S&P 500 has increased less than 3%. “They’ve diversified into wealth management and trading and other forms of revenue streams that can help their overall model grow, and they’ve by and large beat analysts’ expectations,” Petrides added. “Given where valuations are, I do think the large-money","Nov 19, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/goldman-sachs-could-be-best-way-to-play-the-financials-rally.html
1,Is JetBlue Stock a Buy?,. . Why JetBlue Stock May Keep Soaring. COMPANIES MENTIONED IN THIS ARTICLE. MOST READ THIS WEEK. RECENT ARTICLES. 30,"  Shares of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) continue to rise in 2019. The stock is up approximately 20% in 2019 and is coming off a strong earnings report. JBLU reported earnings that beat its consensus earnings estimate by 8 cents a share (59 cents versus 51 cents that was expected). The airline’s revenue of $2.09 billion was in-line with analysts’ estimates. On a year over year basis, JetBlue’s revenues were up 3.9%. The Airline Market Remains Brutally Competitive Despite the positive earnings report, the news has not been all good for JetBlue’s business. Airlines look for both traffic and capacity to increase. And this was the case for JetBlue. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) which is a common metric for traffic came in at 4.31 billion. This was up 6.2% on a year over year basis. Capacity, as measured by consolidated capacity (available seat miles or ASMs), expanded 6.7% to 5.22 billion year-over-year. However, one of the key metrics used for airlines is load factor. This is the percentage of seats filled by passengers. JetBlue’s load factor shrank by 40 basis points to 82.5% because capacity expansion outpaced traffic. This continues a trend that has been consistent through 2019. JetBlue has posted a 5.7% rise in RPMs, but ASMs grew at a larger pace of 6.8%. However, the company is expressing optimism that 2020 will be the year they begin to reap the benefits from an aggressive cost-cutting program that began in 2017. Much of the cost-cutting has been gained through new software tools that have helped the company optimize areas like inventory and labor hours. JetBlue’s Runway Includes Two Significant Catalysts One of the catalysts for JetBlue stock is the composition of its fleet. Notably absent are any of the Boeing 737 MAX airliners that have been held up while the ongoing FAA probe is resolved. Other airlines, such as JetBlue rivals American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) continue to struggle to balance passenger demand with available planes. JetBlue has had no such problems since it does not use any of the 737 MAX planes. The majority of the JetBlue fleet is composed of Airbuses. Recent news suggests that JetBlue’s competitors may soon be taking receipt of the 737 MAX planes. However, it remains to be seen if consumers will avoid the carriers who fly the 737 MAX. That means JetBlue may still retain a slight","Nov 18, 2019",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-jetblue-stock-may-keep-soraing/

merican Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) is the largest airline in the world in terms of fleet size, revenues generated as well as passengers carried. In 2018, it operated 956 mainline aircraft and 595 regional aircraft in its fleet. American carries out its regional operations under the banner of American Eagle, which includes wholly-owned subsidiaries of American Airlines and certain other third-party carriers. Trefis captures trends in American Airlines RevenuesÂ over recent years along with our forecast for the next 2 in an interactive dashboardÂ along-with the trends in key operational parameters. We note that despite the airline’s sizable presence outside the U.S., domestic passenger revenues account for roughly 73% of American Airlines’ total passenger revenues, which in turn represents just over two-thirds of the company’s total revenues. A Quick Look at American Airlinesâ Revenues American Airlinesâ reported $44.5 billion in Total Operating Revenues for full-year 2018. This includes three revenue streams: Despite Strong Global Presence, Domestic Operations Contribute The Highest By Far Notably, the company currently faces capacity constraints from the grounding of its 24 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. With American Airlines looking to add 40 of these aircraft to its fleet over coming years (nearly 20% of new aircraft additions by 2022), the expected delay in delivery of these aircrafts will negatively impact growth in capacity in the near future. This is expected to weigh on Passenger revenues for American Airlines over several quarters.  Whatâs behind Trefis? See How itâs Powering New Collaboration and What-Ifs

3,Our Ultimate Stock-Pickers' Top 10 High-Conviction and New-Money Purchases  | Morningstar,Our Ultimate Stock-Pickers' Top 10 High-Conviction and New-Money Purchases. MORE ON THIS TOPIC. MORE ON THIS TOPIC. SHARE THIS ARTICLE.,"Several funds dive into financial services and undervalued healthcare stocks. For roughly the past decade, our primary goal with the Ultimate Stock-Pickers concept has been to uncover investment ideas that reflect the most recent transactions of our ""Ultimate Stock-Pickers"" in a timely enough manner for investors to get some value from them. In cross-checking the most current valuation work and opinions of Morningstar’s own cadre of stock analysts against the actions of some of the best equity managers in the business, we hope to uncover a few good ideas each quarter that investors can dig into a bit deeper to see if they warrant an investment. With 24 of our Ultimate Stock-Pickers having reported their holdings for the third quarter of 2019, we now have a good sense of the stocks that piqued their interest during the period. Recall that when we look at the buying activity of our Ultimate Stock-Pickers, we focus on high-conviction purchases and new-money buys. We think of high-conviction purchases as instances when managers have made meaningful additions to their portfolios, as defined by the size of the purchase in relation to the size of the portfolio. We define a new-money buy strictly as an instance where a manager purchases a stock that did not exist in the portfolio in the prior period. New-money buys may be done either with or without conviction, depending on the size of the purchase, and a conviction buy can be a new-money purchase if the holding is new to the portfolio. We recognize that our Ultimate Stock-Pickers' decisions to purchase shares of any of the securities highlighted in this article could have been made as early as the start of July, so the prices paid by our managers could be substantially different from today’s trading levels. Therefore, we believe it is always important for investors to assess for themselves the current attractiveness of any security mentioned here based on myriad factors, including our valuation estimates and our moat, stewardship, and uncertainty ratings. At Morningstar’s annual Management Behind the Moat conference, North American director of equity research Jeffrey Stafford led a panel titled, “Equity Market Outlook: Which Sectors Offer the Most Opportunities Today?” Key sectors discussed included consumer goods, healthcare, and technology, which, based on our aggregate analyst price to fair value estimates, appear to offer relatively more opportunity than other sectors.

6,Boeing Stock Inches Higher Following 50 MAX Orders. Here’s What That Means. | Barron's,Boeing Stock Is Inching Higher Following 50 MAX Orders. Here’s What That Means.. For the year Boeing is up about,"  Global aviation stakeholders are meeting in the desert at the 2019 Dubai Air Show. And those stakeholders are standing behind the Boeing 737 MAX. The commercial aerospace giant signed some new orders for its troubled single-aisle jet at the show. The stock is up on the news, but less than 1%. It isn’t a big jump because, even though orders are positive, nothing much has changed. Boeing (ticker: BA) signed agreements for 50 new jets in recent days. Thirty are in the form of “letters of intent,” which aren’t firm orders and don’t go into Boeing’s backlog of commercial aircraft. Twenty are firm and go into the backlog. British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.London) also signed a letter of intent
earlier this year for 200 MAX jets.  The math is a little complicated, but for the year Boeing is up about 200 MAX jets, including the letters of intent. Lion Air—one of the two airlines whose 737 MAX jetliners crashed, killing more than 300 people—is the one notable negative
. It canceled
about 50 MAX orders in the aftermath of the accidents.   It is a remarkable outcome considering the scrutiny
that Boeing and its jet are under. It signals that aviation executives expect the plane to be fixed, be safe and fly again in the near future. Boeing’s most recent update put the MAX reintroduction to service in the first quarter of 2020. Boeing is careful to say that the Federal Aviation Administration and other global aviation regulators are in control of the review process.  Still, the company isn’t out of the woods. After the MAX’s return to service, investors will wait to see how the plane is received by the flying public. And Boeing’s woes have cost it some ground to rival Airbus (AIR.France). “The industry is standing behind the MAX. But Dubai shows that Airbus is marching on with new orders,” Teal Group consultant Richard Aboulafia said. “Until IAG firms up its MAX orders, Boeing is clearly at a serious disadvantage in signing up new customers.” Boeing confirmed recent order activity, but didn’t update the status of the IAG order when asked. About the math, for the full year Boeing has actually cut its 737 backlog by about 200 jets, but included in that amount is reduction for contract accounting changes. And, again, letters of intent don’t make it into backlog until the associated","Nov 19, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-stock-737-max-orders-dubai-air-show-airbus-crashes-grounded-51574178344

The two sides had “constructive discussions on each other’s core concerns in the ‘phase one’ deal, and agreed to maintain close communication,” according to the account. The Chinese account of the talks helped send futures initially higher. However, later in the overnight session, futures pared gains after CNBC reported Beijing was “pessimistic” that a phase one deal would get done given President Donald Trump’s reluctance to roll back existing tariffs on Chinese imports, according to a report citing an unnamed government source. Separately, on Monday, the Trump administration decided to issue a 90-day extension to allow U.S. companies to continue doing business with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.

IndiGo’s market share was down to 47.4% from last month’s 48.2%. On the other hand, SpiceJet’s share rose to 16.3% from September’s 14.7%, according to latest DGCA data. Other major carriers including state-run Air India and Go Airlines also reported a decline in their passenger growth. However, IndiGo is still the market leader with almost every one in two passengers flown by the Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal-founded airline. SpiceJet trails with over 16% share. While Indian aviation industry suffered a major setback with the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX earlier this year followed by the shut down of Naresh Goyal-founded Jet Airways in April, the industry has still reported an over 3% passenger growth rise during September 2018 to October 2019, according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. While 11.46 crore passengers were flown within India from January-October 2018, the number has witnessed a marginal jump to 11.82 crore passengers during the January-October 2019 period.

On the other hand, Air India reported the lowest at punctuality at 54.3%, meaning one in two Air India flights are late.

17,Which is the best business class from Kuala Lumpur to London? Malaysia Airlines vs Qatar Airways vs Emirates compared,Which is the best business class from Kuala Lumpur to London? Malaysia Airlines vs Qatar Airways vs Emirates compared. SHARE,"  According to the Skytrax world airlines awards for 2019, Qatar is the best carrier in the world, Emirates is 5th and Malaysia Airlines is 36. The Skytrax awards are based on the responses of 21 million participants from 100 nationalities. It is touted as the largest annual airline passenger satisfaction survey in the world. I have a number of issues with satisfaction surveys, the primary one being that they don’t really provide any actionable insights. J.D. Power, a research company carries out an annual satisfaction survey of US airlines and their 2019 survey shows travellers are more satisfied than ever with airlines. Yet high levels of satisfaction don’t translate into increased profitability as airline stocks underperform most markets, mainly because as capacity continues to grow, prices continue to fall. And many of those surveyed probably travel once a year in economy. Business class passengers’ account for only 5.4% of international travel, yet are responsible for 30% of airline revenues. On some flights business class passengers account for 75% of profits. Little wonder then that Malaysia airlines, Qatar Airways and Emirates are going all out to attract premium class passengers as we head into the lucrative end of the year holiday season. But which one of them flying to the UK deserves your hard earned money? We compare the business class offerings of these three of the main carriers. Online airline booking experience
If you want an easy to navigate, seamless experience with an online booking engine that is clear and transparent with an intuitive interface then Emirates clinches this important part of the process as all the information is clearly laid out, allowing you to make changes without too much effort or repetition. The Qatar Airways sites is easy to navigate although the font is a bit small. They lose a point for the outrageous ‘no show’ penalties while Malaysia Airlines loses a point for the limited number of flights offered but wins it back for being the only one to offer direct flights, shaving at least 3 hours off the journey time.
Emirates 4. Qatar 3. Malaysia 4. Check in at Kuala Lumpur International Airport
There’s nothing to choose between the three, which is a massive lost opportunity for MAS because KLIA is its home airport and should be used to really make a powerful first impression.

Rival SpiceJet gained market share during the month at 16.3 percent, up from 14.7 percent in the previous month. Overall domestic air passenger traffic in October increased by 3.98 percent compared to the same month last year, according to data released by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on November 18. It indicated that there was some recovery in the aviation sector due to the tourist season. As many as 12.31 million people flew during the month compared to 11.84 million passengers in the same month last year, a jump of 3.98 percent, as per data. ""The passenger load factor in the month of October 2019 has shown increasing trend compared to previous months primarily due to the onset of tourist season,"" DGCA said. However, the passenger load factor of all major airlines -- Air India, SpiceJet, GoAir, IndiGo, AirAsia and Vistara -- declined in October as compared to September this year, as per DGCA data. The passenger load factor measures the seat capacity utilisation of the airline.
