0,High volatility keeps stocks on edge—5 strategists on what comes next,High volatility keeps stocks on edge—5 strategists on what’s next for the market. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC,"Market sentiment is in a flutter. U.S. stocks plunged and then rebounded Wednesday after central banks in New Zealand, India and Thailand cut interest rates amid continued uncertainty over the U.S. trade war with China. Tensions between Beijing and Washington have been escalating this week, signaling high risks of volatility in the market. As trade fears intensify, investors are trading stocks for safer assets like gold and Treasury yields. With concerns a global economic slowdown is approaching and no trade deal in sight, experts worry there will be more pain in the market. Here’s what five experts are watching now: David Herro, chief investment officer and partner at Harris Associates, said market volatility is something investors have to be ready for. “You never really know what actually triggers these things. But, we as investors have to expect them. The European Central Bank has had a very low to negative rate policy for a while. And the fact is, that these banks had been able to supplement earnings through other ways, either by cost cuts or marketing investment products, or other types of fee-based income. As result, despite the low interest rates, we have seen acceptable levels of earnings. And to me, this has meant that these banks are yielding anywhere from 8, 9, 10% — safely.” Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen, thinks there is a 1-in-3 chance of a U.S. recession in the near future. “I think the reason that the attention that we’re paying is more to the bond market than the equity market at this point, is because the central bankers have gotten out in front, a bit. We haven’t seen major economies falling into recession yet. The U.S. looks like it’s still pretty far from recession. We think it’s only about a 1 in 3 chance over the next year, and you need to see the trade-war escalate in order for that to become a big risk. But, because you have central bankers cutting rates ... last week we were talking about the Fed ... why are they cutting rates? Is this a preemptive measure? Now it looks like they should have done 50 [basis-points cut]. And the problem is, looking at the probabilities, if the Fed just delivers on what the market is expecting, it’s not going to have an impact. Even the announcement ... of additional rate cuts, at this point is not","Aug 7, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/07/high-volatility-keeps-stocks-on-edge5-strategists-on-what-comes-next.html

CNBC Newsletters","It’s been a painful few days for stocks, but one corner of the market has had it even worse. Energy has plummeted more than 6% to start August, the worst S&P 500 performer and only sector in a bear market. An escalation in the U.S.-China trade war pulled crude oil lower, a sell-off that spilled over into the energy trade. Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, says it will get worse for energy. “It’s a bearish trend and a poor risk-reward,” Wald said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Monday. “The sector has just not been rewarded when oil rises to the same degree it’s been slammed when oil falls.”  For example, West Texas crude oil has surged more than 110% since bottoming in 2016. Over that period, the XLE energy ETF has added just 19%. Exxon Mobil, the largest stock within the sector, also suggests more downside ahead for the entire energy trade, Wald says. “Exxon Mobil [is] turning lower from the bearish slope of its 200-day moving average. We define that as a resumption of the downtrend,” said Wald. “When you’ve got the biggest stock in the sector acting as that headwind in what is a broad list of bearish trends in this sector, we recommend underweight, avoiding, stay away from energy.”  Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global, agrees that this sector is a no-touch right now. “The fundamentals look just as bad as the technicals,” said Sanchez. “You have growing stockpiles, growing inventories possibly meeting waning demand, and that is just a recipe for disaster.” Commodity investors fear that trade-sparked slowdowns in the U.S. and Chinese economies, the two largest in the world, could suppress demand for oil. “The problem with the oil industry is it moves very slowly, so it can’t really turn on a dime. It’s not going to shut off a whole bunch of oil wells just because of a few demand numbers, so this takes time to play out, and inevitably it just means that you just suffer as the market slowly right sizes,” she said. Sanchez adds that a strengthening U.S. dollar against a weakening foreign-exchange environment could also hit crude oil prices. A strong greenback deters foreign buyers from purchasing costlier U.S.-produced and -priced oil. Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

2,Delta Is Dropping Singapore Flights as It Pursues a New Asia Strategy | The Motley Fool,Delta Is Dropping Singapore Flights as It Pursues a New Asia Strategy. The airline giant plans to close its mini-hub,"   A few months ago, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) received tentative approval to dramatically expand its flight schedule at Tokyo's Haneda International Airport next year. As expected, the airline is taking this opportunity to consolidate all of its Tokyo flights at Haneda, the airport closest to the city center. Last week, Delta confirmed that it plans to shut down its hub at Narita International Airport after more than four decades of service. As part of this restructuring, Delta will stop flying to Singapore as of Sept. 22. From then on, it will rely on joint venture partner Korean Air for getting customers to Singapore. These moves should drive strong unit revenue growth for Delta Air Lines in Asia next year. U.S. airlines regained the right to operate a limited number of flights to Haneda Airport in 2010, more than three decades after having their Tokyo operations transferred to Narita Airport. But for the past few years, the four U.S. airlines that fly to Tokyo have been permitted to operate just six daily round trips combined at Haneda Airport. Delta currently has two of those slots, which it uses for flights from Los Angeles and Minneapolis-St. Paul. That means most of Delta Air Lines' flight activity in Tokyo is still focused on Narita Airport. The airline currently flies to Narita from five domestic cities -- Atlanta, Detroit, Honolulu, Portland (Oregon), and Seattle -- and two international destinations (Manila and Singapore). MOST OF DELTA'S TOKYO FLIGHTS OPERATE AT NARITA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TODAY. IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. Delta has been dissatisfied with this situation for years. Most business travelers prefer Haneda Airport because of its location closer to the city center. Additionally, American Airlines and United Airlines have joint ventures with the two main Japanese airlines, giving them better access to Haneda -- and to the rest of Japan. However, beginning in late March of 2020, U.S. airlines will be permitted to operate up to 18 daily round trips at Haneda Airport, three times the number of flights allowed today. Delta Air Lines received 5 of the 12 extra available route authorities, largely because its lack of a joint venture partner in Japan has put it at a disadvantage there. This will allow it to shift all of its flights between Tokyo and the U.S. to Haneda Airport. Delta's flights from Narita Airport to Singapore and Manila have become collateral","Aug 6, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/06/delta-is-dropping-singapore-flights-as-it-pursues.aspx

Find News,"   Denver, Aug. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, low-fare carrier Frontier Airlines kicks off Green Week and operates America’s Greenest Flight, highlighting the airline’s commitment to fuel efficiency and focus on sustainability. The flight will operate from Denver to GREEN-ville, S.C. utilizing one of the most fuel-efficient aircraft in the world, the A320neo, which is a significant contributor to Frontier operating the most fuel-efficient fleet in the U.S. For the next week, Frontier will be encouraging others to live greener with sustainable giveaways and invites everyone with the last name “Green” to fly for free on Tuesday, August 13, 2019. For more details and to enter to win, visit: http://bit.ly/F9GreenWeek Today’s greenest flight is focused on sustainability on every level. Service items utilized include compostable cold cups, hot cups and napkins made from recycled materials and bamboo stir sticks. Customers will enjoy snacks utilizing eco-friendly packaging and cans, bottles, paper and plastic will be separated and recycled. To further lessen the environmental impact, Frontier is planting enough trees to offset the flight’s carbon footprint. In addition, all passengers onboard America’s Greenest Flight will receive “green inspired” gifts to encourage them think sustainably long after they have reached their destination. “Our fleet’s fuel efficiency is unmatched by other U.S. airlines and allows Frontier to deliver not only the lowest fares but the most sustainable approach to flying,” said Barry Biffle, President and CEO of Frontier Airlines. “We are proud to serve communities across the U.S. and understand the importance of being good stewards of the environment. We’re focused on lessening Frontier’s impact on the environment and continually search for innovative solutions and technology to achieve that.” Frontier exclusively operates the A320 family of aircraft and has the largest A320neo fleet in the U.S., delivering the highest level of noise reduction and fuel-efficiency, compared to previous models. The use of these aircraft, Frontier’s seating configuration, weight-saving tactics and baggage process have all contributed to the airline’s average of 39% fuel savings compared to other U.S. airlines (fuel savings is based on Frontier Airlines 2018 fuel consumption per seat-mile compared to the weighted average of major U.S. airlines).  There are many ways to think about Frontier’s fuel savings, for example: it’s the equivalent of the carbon used to produce 359 billion straws, or the fuel used to make 15.2 billion plastic bottles, or the greenhouse gas emissions from 192,000","Aug 7, 2019",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/frontier-airlines-operates-america-s-greenest-flight-1028427588

5,Diversified Portfolios Do Not Reduce Competition,Diversified Portfolios Do Not Reduce Competition. Common Ownership Theory is Misapplied to Broadly Diversified Portfolios. Common Ownership Theory Lacks a,"Barbara Novick is Vice Chairman at BlackRock, Inc. This post is based on a Policy Spotlight issued by Blackrock. In 1990, Professor Harry Markowitz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his groundbreaking work on the importance of portfolio diversification to achieving better risk-adjusted returns, which serves as the basis of modern portfolio theory. [1] The value of diversified investing is now being challenged by a small group of academics who claim that ownership of diversified portfolios may create anti-competitive effects. According to their theory, when investors own more than one company in a concentrated industry (‘common ownership’ or ‘horizontal shareholding’), these companies are less likely to compete. Investment funds and pension plans—including those using active or index strategies—are equally implicated by this theory, as these investors own broadly diversified investment portfolios, which often entail owning more than one company per sector. The plausibility of the theory (as discussed below) and the methods and data used to measure this purported effect have been vigorously criticized by academics and practitioners. For example, the foundational paper in this area, sometimes called the ‘airlines paper’ is based on incorrect data (see Policy Spotlight, Common Ownership Data is Incorrect). [2] Nonetheless, this theory has received media attention and some focus in competition circles.  Although the papers underlying this theory are controversial, and the theory itself has been challenged by other academics, some anti-trust scholars have accepted the theory and claim that diversified portfolios are creating societal harm. Based on this view, they have proposed drastic policy measures such as: (i) limiting ownership to one company per sector or (ii) eliminating proxy voting rights of mutual funds, pension funds, and other institutional investors. [3] The ‘common ownership’ theory relies on the assumption that all ‘common owners’ benefit from lessened competition, as it is derived from theories of oligopolies and ‘cross ownership’ (e.g., where a company buys a stake in its competitor). While lessened competition might benefit certain concentrated investors, broadly diversified investors, like index funds, own the whole market and do not benefit from lessened competition. This is because broadly diversified investors are subject to inter– industry effects—meaning that what happens in one sector affects the performance of the fund’s holdings in other sectors. For example, airline carriers represent less than 1% of all major indexes (Exhibit 1), so the benefit of higher ticket prices for the 1% of an index fund’s portfolio","Aug 7, 2019",https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/08/07/diversified-portfolios-do-not-reduce-competition/

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Each Friday this summer, an El Al Airlines Boeing 787-9 — an airplane with a list price of almost $300 million, arrives in Las Vegas in the late morning, then sits for nearly 36 hours before returning to Tel Aviv late the next night. This is typically not how airlines use their newest, most efficient and priciest assets. But it’s normal for Israel’s national airline, which grounds its airplanes on Shabbat every week, from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. It’s among the many reasons El Al, Israel’s national carrier since 1948, could be the world’s most unusual airline. “People try to compare us to Air New Zealand, but they fly on Saturdays,” CEO Gonen Usishkin said in a recent interview. It’s probably no surprise El Al has struggled to turn a profit in recent years. In the first quarter of this year, the airline said it lost $55 million, a larger loss than in the same period last year, when the Passover holiday boosted revenues. In full-year 2018, El Al lost $52 million, though it posted a small profit ($6 million) in 2017. Its idiosyncrasies make it tough to run. How many other carriers shut down for a day each week? How many represent countries that have no diplomatic relations with many neighboring countries? How many struggle to sell connecting itineraries because security controls at its home airport are too stringent to make it viable? But Usishkin, a former combat pilot in the Israeli Air Force, took over as CEO last year, with a mandate to turn the airline, which privatized more than a decade ago, into a more nimble business. El Al still won’t be flying on the Sabbath, but it is finally confronting the realities of a new era, amid increased competition from U.S. legacy carriers and European low-cost airlines. It is spending to upgrade its fleet and onboard product, while changing where it flies, betting on long-haul flights where the competition is a little less fierce. It would also like its government, which has opened its borders to just about any foreign carrier, to show a","Aug 6, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/israel-el-al-airlines-tries-060055888.html

By: Ben Brown | Email | Leave a comment The US stock market collapsed yesterday, wiping out more than $700 billion in a matter of hours. Jeff Bezos was among the many billionaires that saw his net worth slashed, but how much did the Amazon boss lose? According to Bloomberg, Bezos’ net worth declined by $3.4 billion yesterday as Amazon stock crumbled more than 3 percent. Meanwhile, the bitcoin price soared 10 percent as traders sought to put money in non-correlated assets. As the global elite lost billions, one of the world’s leading bitcoin investment firms, Grayscale, saw its assets under management (AUM) rise to nearly $3 billion. The world’s richest man lost more than $3 billion on Monday during the stock market plunge. Bezos owns more than 57 million Amazon shares so it’s no surprise his net worth took a beating as Amazon’s stock price fell. Jeff Bezos’ hit was softened by the fact he sold almost $3 billion worth of Amazon stock at the end of July. The Amazon CEO offloaded roughly 1.5 million shares over a number of days – his largest divestment since 2017. It’s rumored that Bezos plans to pump that money into his space program Blue Origin. Jeff Bezos wasn’t the only billionaire to see his net worth wiped out on Monday. 21 high-net worth investors took a billion dollar haircut on the stock market’s worst day of the year.  Mark Zuckerberg saw hit net worth decline by $2.8 billion.

While the rest of the stock market rebounded by 1.2 percent on Tuesday, Beyond Meat stock tanked by $15 per share, or 8.4 percent. Beyond Meat stock is now down 30 percent from its all-time high. What’s going on and will it continue? On a day with no real company-specific news, the reasons for the selloff are fairly obvious… with one big culprit. Beyond Meat announced it would make a secondary stock offering at $160 per share which, at the time, was significantly below the current stock price. That price was bad enough to drive the sellers.   Yet the real problem is that 3.48 million shares were sold by current shareholders of Beyond Meat. That sends only one message. These insiders believe that this is as good as things are going to get with Beyond Meat’s stock price. They want to get out now while the share price is stupidly high, and demonstrates skepticism about Beyond Meat’s long-term prospects. That means only 250,000 shares were actually sold by Beyond Meat to the public, raising only about $38 million. Rarely do secondary offerings occur this close to an IPO, and rarely do insiders sell out at this stage. This is terrible news for the long term.

15,Is the Air NZ share price in the buy zone after falling 12% YTD?,. . . . . . . . . Is the Air NZ share price in the buy zone after,"      Chris Chitty | August 6, 2019 4:57pm | More on: AIZ With the Air New Zealand Limited (ASX: AIZ) share price down 12% in 2019 so far, I think it’s a good time to buy shares of the airline. Air New Zealand provides domestic and international travel to and from New Zealand along with cargo and engineering services. It has a market capitalisation of $2.94 billion.  Air New Zealand has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.08x against the ASX 200, which has a P/E ratio of 17.81x at the time of writing. This cheap valuation could be associated with the risks of operating an airline along with debt levels; however, Air New Zealand has proven to be a very profitable business. While earnings have been down by around a third in 2019, this does not change the fact that the group has a low valuation. The group has a grossed-up dividend yield of 6.7%. This is a healthy return against the current cash rate of just 1%. So far in 2019, its management have held the dividend steady. Given that the group had a payout ratio of 63% in 2018, there should be room to maintain dividends even in the face of lower earnings, provided that they do not drop a great deal more. Air New Zealand has a price-to-book ratio of 1.47. This is against the ASX 200, which has a price-to-book ratio of 2.12. This suggests that the group is valued conservatively when considering its accounting value. Additionally, in the last 5 years the group have generally achieved a return on equity between 10% and 20%. Another positive sign for this company is its cash flow, which has historically been much higher than earnings. This suggests that real earnings may be higher than what accounting values represent, as airlines face a high amount of depreciation and Air New Zealand is no exception. This non-cash write down of assets will reduce net profit while real cash generated by the business may be much higher than it appears. One risk that should be mentioned is the company’s debt-to-equity ratio. This is high at 125.6% and suggests that the company is heavily geared. While this will contribute to earnings, it needs to be considered as a risk that could throw the company off track if earnings are lost.
