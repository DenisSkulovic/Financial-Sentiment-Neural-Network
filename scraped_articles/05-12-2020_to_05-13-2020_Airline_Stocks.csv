3,Stock Market News: Why Airline Stocks Are Losing Altitude Again | The Motley Fool,"Stock Market News: Why Airline Stocks Are Losing Altitude Again. The stock market moved lower early Wednesday, and there's pain","   The stock market moved lower on Wednesday morning, reacting negatively to comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell. Powell painted an ugly picture of what the future might bring, noting all the challenges that the economy will face in trying to recover from the severe disruptions that the coronavirus pandemic has caused. As of 11:15 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down 227 points to 23,537. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 15 points to 2,855, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) eased lower by 15 points to 8,988. Leading stocks lower were airlines, with significant losses for major carriers and smaller companies alike. With so much doubt about whether travel will ever be the same, investors are fearful about the long-term prospects for airlines and their ability to make changes that reflect a new normal in a post-coronavirus world. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The latest reality check for airlines came from aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA). On Tuesday, the company's CEO David Calhoun predicted that a major carrier would likely be forced to file for bankruptcy protection within the next several months. Calhoun didn't offer which airline he thought would be a casualty of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but investors took the statement as a blanket condemnation of the industry's prospects. On Wednesday morning, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) took the hardest hit among the top four airlines, falling almost 9%. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) suffered 6% declines, while Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) fell 5%. Yet the damage wasn't limited to the major carriers. Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) saw the biggest drop of nearly 14%, but JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) were all down 5% to 7%. The problem lies in how little room airlines have to adapt to a new normal. Calhoun said that even four months from now, traffic could be just a quarter of what it was before the pandemic. He suggested that it could be 2025 before air travel fully recovers. In the interim, airlines have to deal with multiple challenges. Coronavirus-related policies like mask-wearing requirements are running into resistance from passengers, while efforts to leave distance on flights will require the companies to accept revenue-losing empty seats. Having taken assistance from the federal government, airlines now have stakeholders with different priorities than their traditional shareholders.

4,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. Jerome Powell quashes hopes of a quick recovery.. What happened. So what. Now what.,"   Airline shares were under pressure again on Wednesday following comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell forecasting a long post-COVID-19 recovery that could ""leave behind lasting damage"" to the economy. The airlines need a quick economic rebound to avoid financial distress, and Powell's comments provided new reason for investors to worry about the viability of airline shares. As of 12:30 p.m. EDT, shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) were down 14%, shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) were off 9.8%, and shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) were all down more than 5% apiece. The airlines are in crisis mode, slashing flights, grounding planes, and cutting costs in hopes of weathering a pandemic-induced travel slump that has seen travel demand down 90% or more year over year. The companies have raised billions in fresh liquidity thanks to a U.S. government bailout package as well as debt and equity sales, but no amount of cash will be enough if revenue does not rebound eventually. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. After losing half of their value or more as the pandemic initially spread, airline stocks have stabilized somewhat, and now tend to trade along with broader market sentiment about how long the pandemic will last and what the economy will look like once it is over. Powell's comments spoke to the worst fears among airline investors, suggesting that travel demand will be slow to materialize once the stay-at-home orders are lifted. We know it is going to take time to see airlines fully recover. I believe it could take three years or more before traffic returns to pre-pandemic levels. But airlines can likely stumble along if some weakened version of a more normal travel environment emerges in the months to come. What airlines and their investors hope to avoid is ""lasting damage"" to the economy. The stocks are down today despite a well-known portfolio manager coming to the industry's defense. Bill Miller, the one-time chief investment officer of Legg Mason who now runs his own firm, told CNBC on Tuesday, ""If you don't own the airlines, then you're making a bet against the vaccine."" Miller's argument is that consumers love travel and people will resume flying as soon as it is safe.

More Resources for the Stocks in this","  DAL – The market is pushing higher…but not the airline stock still trading 50-60-70% off all time highs. Is it finally time to buy this dip in DAL, LUV and UAL? Read on… May 12, 2020  The airline industry has been decimated both in terms of ticket sales and stock prices.  The majority of the industry’s stocks are down 50% – 75% or even more since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.  However, there is reason for hope.  More people are willing to fly now that coronavirus-related deaths are on the downswing and quarantines are being lifted.  This means the sharp industry-wide selloff might also be coming to an end in the near future.  When the time is right, seize the opportunity to invest in these three airlines: Delta, Southwest and United Airlines Holdings. Delta Air Lines (DAL)  There is a diamond in every rough.  Though most airline stocks have quickly become risky investments as daily sales losses pile up, a few have the potential to bounce back sooner than their peers.  DAL is one of these diamonds in the rough. 7 ""SAFE HAVEN"" Dividend Stocks for Turbulent Times There’s a lot to like about DAL, especially as a long-term investment play. Take the quadrupling of the dividend since 2014, for instance.  Prior to the COVID-10 slowdown, DAL had the honor of being the world’s largest passenger airline.  There is no reason to think this status will change in any substantive way when the economy reopens. DAL is currently trading at $22 a share yet TipRanks’ average analyst price target is $38.58.  As detailed in this Motely Fool article, DAL has outpaced its airline peers in free cash flow and net income, making it the darling of a beaten-down industry sure to spring back to life when society returns to normal.  If you are OK dealing with some turbulence, now is a great time to buy DAL. Southwest Airlines Company (LUV) When it comes to stock analysis, a company’s “buy and hold” value combined with its ranking amongst its industry peers and industry rank as a whole are of the utmost importance.  However, when you take a look at the POWR Ratings for airline stocks, most grade quite poorly.

The stocks are still reeling from disappointing earnings results and Warren Buffett’s exit from the industry. Let’s take a closer look at the charts. Daily chart of American Airlines stock. Chart courtesy of Stockcharts.com  The problem is, $10 is beginning to act as resistance. When former support is lost and turns to resistance, it’s a bearish development. It doesn’t help that American Airlines is trending lower and is below all of its major moving averages. At least the setup is simple. Keep an eye on $9. If this level is lost and the stock closes below it, shares can continue to decline. Above $10 is a win for the bulls — albeit a small one. In that event, it puts the 20-day moving average and downtrend resistance in play, followed by the 50-day moving average. Daily chart of United Airlines stock. Chart courtesy of Stockcharts.com United Airlines stock has looked a little better than American Airlines, but not by much. Like American, United stock is below downtrend resistance and its key moving averages. However, unlike American, United hasn’t retested its March low. That’s an encouraging sign for longs. Right now though, shares are looking weak. What bulls want to avoid is a break of this month’s low at $22.39. If that happens, it puts the $21.50 area in play. Below that and the 2020 low near $18 is possible. You can see how a prolonged selloff could have a cascading effect for United Airlines stock. On the upside, shares need to close above the declining 20-day moving average.

8,Beleaguered American Airlines Stock May Have Nearly 80% Upside From Here | InvestorPlace,Beleaguered American Airlines Stock May Have Nearly 80% Upside From Here. Airline stocks are still a gamble at this point," A tug of war is brewing between the airline bulls and bears. Ever since the novel coronavirus outbreak sent airline traffic lower, shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) hammered down to the $10 level. Buyers tried to send AAL stock back by 30%-50%. But optimism continues to wane as markets evaluate the sector’s prospects. AAL stock will more likely suit traders. Why? For starters, legendary investor Warren Buffet sold his entire stake in airline stocks. Buffett revealed that his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) dump all airline stocks from its portfolio. He said that he was wrong about the business. When he started a position in American and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), he thought that he bought the business at an attractive price. But the Covid-19 pandemic forced countries to close their borders to foreigners. Domestic and international business travel fell to practically zero (down more than 90% from last year). And tourism is not on anyone’s near-term plans, either. [Which, see: Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL), Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL)] Dallas-based American is managing costs and watching its cash flow drain day by day. It cannot predict passenger miles volumes. For now, the market is content with a $4.84 billion market cap at the $10 a share price. That reflects the 18.9% drop in revenue passenger miles in the first quarter. Its load factor fell from 83.1% last year to 73.9%. The second quarter will include more weeks of the lockdown. American ended Q1 with $6.8 billion in liquidity, which included $2 billion generated in the period. Management forecasts a $70 million daily cash burn rate for the current (second) quarter.

9,Warren Buffett Sold His Airline Stocks: Should You Dump Air Canada? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Warren Buffett Sold His Airline Stocks: Should You Dump Air Canada?. Why,"      David Jagielski | May 13, 2020 | More on: AC It was a big surprise when Warren Buffett announced this month that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) sold off all of its airline stocks. It was only a couple of months ago when the World Health Organization first labelled the coronavirus a pandemic. A Buffett told Yahoo Finance that he wouldn’t be selling his airline stocks. However, a lot has changed in just a few months. Millions of COVID-19 cases have occurred since then and shutdowns around the world are crippling the demand for air travel down to a grinding halt. The long-term investor said, “The world has changed for airlines. And I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way.” He went on to say he wasn’t sure what the future would hold and “I don’t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.” Uncertainty is the recurring theme that kept coming up for Buffett when talking about the future of airline stocks and is likely a key reason why he decided to give up on them. Even the airlines don’t know how long it’ll be before things get back to normal. Earlier this month, Air Canada (TSX:AC) released its quarterly results where it posted a mammoth loss of more than $1 billion. The airline said it expects that it will take at least three years for traffic levels to get back to where they were in 2019. However, it’s impossible to predict how things will play out given we’re in unchartered territory. CEO Calin Rovinescu said, “We’re now living through the darkest period ever in the history of commercial aviation, significantly worse than 9/11, SARS and the 2008 financial crisis.” Although Buffett sold his airline stocks, he also said to “bet on America,” suggesting that like with every downturn or recession in history, the economy will recover. The problem is that we’re just at the beginning stages of the downturn, and a recovery could be years away from taking place. However, investors shouldn’t necessarily rush out to sell their shares of Air Canada. There aren’t nearly as many airlines in Canada as there are in the U.S., making Air Canada’s role in the industry that much more important to the government and to the economy.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   United Airlines Holdings UAL, alike its peers American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL and Southwest Airlines LUV, is under significant pressure from the decline in air travel demand following the coronavirus outbreak. However, there are certain positives that support its long-term growth potential.

With fuel expenses comprising a major chunk of airline expenditures, low fuel prices are a boon to the carrier. Over the past few months, crude oil prices have been trending at a very low level. The significant savings on fuel costs (down 7.3% in first-quarter 2020) should drive the bottom line and minimize losses resulting from the drop in demand.
 
The company’s strong performance in 2019 despite headwinds such as prolonged MAX groundings, government shutdown and poor weather conditions is worth noting. Notwithstanding these obstacles, United Airlines achieved its 2020 adjusted earnings per share target of $11-$13 in 2019 itself. United Airlines Holdings Inc Price and Consensus   United Airlines Holdings Inc price-consensus-chart | United Airlines Holdings Inc Quote   Additionally, the carrier’s cost-controlling measures like freezing hiring (except for crucial roles), delaying salary increases as well as giving employees the option to apply for unpaid leave of absence voluntarily, should help in preserving a substantial amount of cash to combat the coronavirus-led downturn. Notably, the carrier reduced its adjusted capex guidance for 2020 by $2.5 billion in view of the coronavirus crisis. For the current year, capital expenditures are expected to be below $4.5 billion.

Further, the fact that the carrier is keeping up with its fleet modernization efforts despite the massive downturn in its business is encouraging. In this regard, the carrier is replacing outdated planes with new ones. The recent deal with Bank of China Aviation to sell 22 planes is a positive in this respect. The pact covers a fleet of six Boeing 787-9 and 16 Boeing 737-9 MAX planes. However, the planes can be leased back to the carrier under long-term agreements. The deal is expected to close later this year. These fleet upgradation efforts should boost operational efficiency.

With air-travel demand on the wane due to the coronavirus pandemic, the carriers have been persistently incurring losses for the current earnings season. Notably, the likes of United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL too suffered losses for the March quarter, which they confirmed while announcing respective first-quarter financial numbers in the previous week. However, offering some relief, the likes of Allegiant Travel Company ALGT, Copa Holdings CPA and SkyWest SKYW managed to record earnings for the first quarter. Wrap-Up on the Past Week’s Key Headlines 1. JetBlue’s first-quarter 2020 loss (excluding 55 cents from non-recurring items) of 42 cents per share, compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 41 cents. Results of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier, were hurt by the coronavirus-induced weakness in air-travel demand. Moreover, operating revenues of $1,588 million decreased 15.1% year over year and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,690 million. The year-over-year plunge was due to the 16.1% drop in passenger revenues. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. 2. Spirit Airlines incurred a loss of 86 cents per share (excluding 45 cents from non-recurring items) in first-quarter 2020, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 60 cents.

Copa Holdings’ first-quarter 2020 earnings of $1.75 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19 cents. However, the bottom line was down17.1% year over year, primarily due to lower revenues.

In the wake of the nationwide lockdown that was enforced in three phases, the government has suspended all train and flight services.

18,Recent market volatility has caused risk split among investors.,Survey: Volatility Brings Out Tale of Two Investors. Recent market swings have caused a split in investor behavior across age..,"There’s nothing like the fastest bear market in history, followed by one of the fastest bear market rallies ever, mixed in with the highest layoffs America has ever seen, to bring out the animal spirits in investors. Their reactions, though, have uncovered a notable split between what younger, less-affluent, long-term investors are doing, versus the behavior of older Gen X’ers and Baby Boomers with a shorter time until retirement and more money at risk. That risk has been polarized as younger investors hunt and gather the riskiest stocks in the hope of greater rewards, while older investors seek the safety of blue chips, money market funds, and the old-fashioned piggy bank.  Investopedia’s latest survey of active investors reveals that the recent market turbulence has caused a broad re-thinking of risk: two-thirds of respondents state they have changed their overall investing approach, but how they’re changing appears split down the middle. Those going bigger, buying blue chips on a bargain and grabbing shares in the beaten-down airline sector tend to be Millennials, though there are some Gen Xers and Boomers in the bunch. By contrast those seeking safer havens like money market funds and high-yield savings tend to be Boomers. The change in investment patterns isn’t just what our readers are buying, but how much. 37% of younger, riskier investors are investing more money than they were in March, and 39% are investing more often. They may see a generational opportunity to buy stocks at a discount and are counting on a return of the same stock market dynamics from 2010-2019 with an accommodative Federal Reserve and trillions of fiscal stimulus. Older investors saw that movie play out over a decade ago, and while it ended well, they likely don’t have the patience to watch, are planning on retiring too soon to reap its benefits, or doubt it will end the same way this time.  Another notable finding is that while the market has been rising, more money than ever has been flowing out of stocks and into money market funds and bonds, both corporate and government. Part of that can be explained by the Federal Reserve’s pledge to continue quantitative easing by buying government securities, and backing the corporate bond market through its support of so-called Fallen Angels. Money market funds have seen record inflows, topping $4.1 trillion this year.
