American Airlines CEO Gave a","by Gary Leff on November 4, 2019 At the American Airlines ‘State of the Airline’ meeting with employees following Thursday’s earnings call, CEO Doug Parker explained why he believes American’s shares have performed horrendously. I think [the American Airlines stock] is undervalued. I generally think that. I think that more than usual. But don’t use that as personal investment advice, you should make your own decisions. The reason I think we’ve gotten ourselves undervalued. When I say undervalued what I mean by that is the stock is selling for less than I believe it’s worth. We’ve gotten ourselves in that position because we’ve underperformed. That’s what happens. Often the stock market cares about momentum. And much of those who buy and sell stocks care as much about trends as they care about absolute value. While I may believe it’s selling for a lot less than it’s worth, what I know is that when we go run a summer like we ran our stock will fall. It doesn’t just affect our team and our customers it affects our shareholders…that’s why in the last month or two it has fallen more than others have fallen. And the good news is when -we shift our momentum, and we start doing all the things that I told you we intend to do it should indeed increase. But it’s not going to do it because we say those things are going to happen. It’s going to do it because we go do those things. And that’s what we need to do. The stock follows performance, it doesn’t project performance as much as we’d like it to. We need to go produce. I’m really excited about our ability to go do that. And I suspect when we do you will see our stock respond accordingly.  Copyright: rido / 123RF Stock Photo American has been attributing its troubles to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and to a work slowdown by mechanics. However the airline’s poor stock performance predates both of those things. Shares peaked in January 2018. Moreover the big summer slide in share price didn’t come until mid-July, long after mechanics (and management failures) hampered the airline’s performance.  Regardless, Doug Parker’s theory of the stock market is intriguing:  I’m not certain those two things are entirely consistent with each other. There’s significant academic research in support of momentum as a factor","Nov 4, 2019",https://viewfromthewing.com/why-american-airlines-stock-suffers-according-to-its-ceo/

re you ready for another round of earnings reports? We’re looking at three Strong Buy stocks which are reporting on Tuesday, and investors should be excited. The Q3 earnings season has been better than was anticipated, with 60% of S&P listed companies beating forecasts on revenues, and 74% beating on EPS. It’s a good end to a rough summer in the markets. We found these top stocks through TipRanks’ Stock Screener tool, by setting the filters to sort for ‘strong buy’ ratings, any upside, and dividend payouts. The results are stocks that investors can expect to show solid returns in the coming months. Diamondback Energy (FANG) Based in Texas, Diamondback Energy engages in ‘hydrocarbon exploration,’ or to put it layman’s terms, oil drilling. Diamondback operates in the Permian Basin, of the richest oil regions in Texas and a driver of the fracking boom in the oil and gas industry that has bumped the US to the #1 spot as the world’s largest oil producer. The company is a mid-size player in the industry, with a market-cap of $14 billion, annual revenues exceeding $2.18 billion, and net profits in the range of $940 million – based on a daily production greater than 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent. A product that the modern world cannot do without, along with smart management, has kept FANG profitable despite a 6% drop in share value this year. The company makes up for the lack of share appreciation with a modest dividend of 0.8% yield, or roughly half the sector average. The quarterly payout is 4.75 cents per share. Looking ahead, the markets expect to see FANG report an earnings increase year-over-year, along with higher quarterly revenues Diamondback’s EPS has been rising steadily since Q1 of this year, although the company did miss the forecast last quarter by 2%. In the last eight quarters, Diamondback has beaten the earnings forecasts five times. Putting this into raw numbers, analysts expect FANG to show $1.73 in the Q3 report, based on $1.05 billion in revenues. This represents an earnings beat of 3.6%, and a revenue beat of an impressive 95.3%. Speaking of analysts, Roth Capital’s John White sees reason for optimism in FANG’s low debt load. As he points out, the company operates with low leverage, allowing it to focus on drilling activities and production. White writes, “Our rationale is that FANG does not receive proper credit for","Nov 4, 2019",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings%3A-3-strong-buy-stocks-to-watch-tuesday-2019-11-04

In-flight catering service or airline catering is a service provided by companies during air travel to the passengers. In-flight catering is a very critical part of the airline business, especially for the network carriers that offer long haul (long distance) service. Meal design and meal planning are important process of in-flight catering service. According to International Air Transportation Association (IATA), catering planning and operation are important. For instance, a large-scale flight catering production unit may employ over 800 staff to produce as many as 25,000 meals per day during peak periods. A large international airline company may have hundreds of takeoffs and landings every day from just their main hub. These facts and others like them make flight catering unlike any other sector of the catering industry.

Airlines were becoming aware regarding the importance of the in-flight service, and introduced custom-built galleys, complete with water boilers, hot cups, and flasks. Developments also took place to ensure that tray equipment, such as cups, plates, cutlery, and glassware, were light weight and can be stored in confine space. Internet technology has permitted advances in the interfacing of airlines, caterers, and suppliers with a comprehensive e-commerce-based system. The launch of eLSG.SKYCHEFS and e-gatematrix in 2001 has enabled the world’s two largest flight caterers assist in areas of equipment management, procurement, and basic information dissemination. Airlines can then work with caterers and suppliers on food service, scheduling, menu specifications, meal ordering, and other functions. Ordering a meal is not a problem. Cathy Pacific Airways and Virgin Atlantic offer passengers in-flight e-mail and intranet services across their entire fleet. Airlines are also responding to the global market by the larger carriers forming","Nov 4, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flight-catering-market-aircraft-class-082717497.html

6,Is the Competition Gaining on Hawaiian Airlines? | The Motley Fool,Is the Competition Gaining on Hawaiian Airlines?. Headwinds from the Department of Transportation and increased competition are putting Hawaiian Airlines,"   The pressure is heating up for Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ:HA) after Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) started servicing inter-island routes in 2017 in addition to the newly added long-haul trips from the west coast to the Hawaii Islands in 2019. Servicing passengers throughout seven countries, Hawaiian Airlines relies upon Hawaii travelers to fill most of the capacity -- making the airline vulnerable as competing airlines fight for Hawaii travel capacity. As most large U.S.-based airlines are now servicing Hawaii routes in one form or another, investors are left wondering if Hawaiian Airlines can stay competitive if this becomes a race to the bottom on fare prices and offerings, lowering Hawaiian Airlines' ability to attract customers -- potentially slowing revenue growth.  Hawaiian Airlines' antitrust immunity application was turned down by the Department of Transportation (DOT) in October. Teaming up in marketing programs with Japan Airlines would allow for competitive pricing and schedules against competitors. The agreement would allow Hawaiian to reach 34 locations throughout Japan in addition to 11 locations in Asia that are outside of Japan -- widening its reach. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Without the antitrust immunity, Hawaiian Airlines and Japan Airlines cannot coordinate pricing and schedules and can only share in marketing and frequent-flyer programs. This blow from the DOT hinders expansion plans for both airlines, which is why Hawaiian Airlines applied for an extension to prove to the DOT that the immunity is necessary and fair -- which is due November 12. Currently, Hawaiian is expanding into the Fukuoka, Japan to Honolulu route at the end of November, which will be a nonstop flight from the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, Hawaiian has been approved for Haneda, Japan, and is expected to begin in March of 2020. Hawaiian now operates 31 nonstop flights between Hawaii and Japan, which is set to expand further with an additional four flights between Fukuoka and Honolulu. The overcapacity of flights from the west coast of the United States to Hawaii is a concern. Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK) proclaims itself as the carrier ""offering more nonstop flights to and from Hawaii than any other airline."" It announced in October that two routes will be canceled due to increased competition. Alaska Airlines will be cutting the alternating daily flights between San Francisco and Sacramento to Kona, and expanding routes from San Jose and San Diego to Kona in 2020.

7,American Airlines' Cost Trajectory May Be About to Improve | The Motley Fool,American Airlines' Cost Trajectory May Be About to Improve. The airline giant has faced severe unit cost pressure over the,"   After briefly becoming one of the most profitable airlines in the world during 2015, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) suffered severe margin erosion in the following years. A modest rebound in fuel costs drove some of this margin pressure, but rising nonfuel unit costs represented an even bigger headwind. American Airlines' adjusted nonfuel unit costs came in at 9.4 cents in 2014. Based on American's 2018 cost performance and 2019 guidance, adjusted nonfuel unit costs will reach 11.5 cents this year. That would be up 22% compared to 2014, a compound annual growth rate of 4% over five years. (For comparison, most U.S. airlines try to limit annualized nonfuel unit cost growth to 2% or less.) However, the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX grounding has exacerbated American Airlines' unit cost inflation this year. The 737 MAX's return -- expected in early 2020 -- could spark a change for the better in American Airlines' unit cost trends over the next few years. AMERICAN AIRLINES' UNIT COST TRAJECTORY IS SET TO IMPROVE STARTING IN 2020. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. Fleet simplification has been the centerpiece of American Airlines' cost-cutting plans in recent years. Following the US Airways merger, American Airlines was operating too many aircraft types. Additionally, in many cases, it operated multiple subfleets of a particular model, adding to the complexity. In a presentation earlier this year, management noted that it had reduced the number of subfleets from 52 to 42 between 2016 and 2018. It also set a goal of having just 30 subfleets by the end of 2022. This should reduce maintenance costs, improve pilot productivity, and limit disruption in the event of last-minute aircraft switches. American Airlines took one big step toward fleet simplification in 2019, as it retired the last of its MD-80s in early September. However, there is a lot more on the way over the next several years. American Airlines plans to retire all 20 of its high-cost Embraer E190s in 2020. It began phasing out its last 24 Boeing 767s earlier this year and will retire all of them by the end of 2021. Finally, the carrier's recent order for 50 Airbus A321XLRs will pave the way for it to retire the rest of its Boeing 757s by 2024. American will likely retire its Airbus A330-300 fleet around the same time. THE A321XLR'S ARRIVAL BEGINNING IN 2023 WILL ALLOW AMERICAN AIRLINES TO RETIRE THE","Nov 5, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/05/american-airlines-cost-trajectory-may-be-about-to.aspx

In a separate development, country's air safety watchdog on Friday said that IndiGo must replace all Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines on its fleet of 97 twin-engine Airbus A320neo family aircraft with new P&W power units, following recent inflight engine shutdowns.

14,Why Citigroup Says to Buy Delta Air Lines Stock,Why Citigroup Says to Buy Delta Air Lines Stock. Why is Citigroup bullish on Delta Air Lines stock?. Trent’s views,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Delta Air Lines stock gained 1.7% on Friday after Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent suggested investors buy it. He initiated coverage on the stock with a bullish recommendation and a target price of $65. The analyst’s target price implies a 16% upside over the next year. CNBC reports Trent is impressed with Delta’s (DAL) “revenue diversity, its relatively smooth earnings stream, and its solid alliance network.” Delta derives passenger revenue from several channels. The company, known for its premium-class seating and amenities, continues to add premium seating capacity. The capacity brings double the fares as economy class. In the third quarter, the company’s premium product ticket revenue rose 9% YoY (year-over-year). Moreover, the airline is focusing on driving revenue through non-ticket sources such as onboard food and services and baggage fees. Premium tickets and non-ticket sources contributed nearly 52% of Delta’s overall third-quarter revenue. Trent is also impressed with Delta’s back-to-back quarters of robust bottom-line results. The company has surpassed analysts’ earnings estimates in the last nine quarters, and has recorded double-digit YoY earnings growth in the last five. Additionally, Trent sees its alliances with other airlines and companies boosting its financials in the long run. On September 26, Delta announced a $2.25 billion partnership with LATAM Airlines. According to the contract, the company will buy a 20% stake in LATAM for $1.9 billion and invest an additional $350 million. The investment would help Delta expand across Latin America and compete with American Airlines (AAL). American Airlines has a strong presence in South America through its partnership with LATAM Airlines. Delta projects the LATAM collaboration will be accretive to its earnings over the next two years. Trent’s “buy” rating for Delta is surprising. Many other analysts have downgraded the stock and lowered its target price since its third-quarter earnings release on October 10. Following the release, Argus Research and Stephens downgraded Delta stock to a “neutral” equivalent from a “buy” equivalent. Stephens also cut its target price by 24% to $57. Raymond James and Buckingham Research have trimmed their target prices by $6 and $2, respectively, to $64 and $56. Most analysts have raised concerns about rising costs and pricing pressure hurting Delta’s profitability next year. Bernstein forecasts that higher maintenance costs, wages, and tariffs could impact Delta’s earnings. Delta’s third-quarter results also signaled rising costs and pricing pressure. The company’s third-quarter non-fuel expenses rose 2.4% YoY,","Nov 4, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/11/why-citigroup-says-buy-delta-air-lines-stock/
15,IndiGo and Qatar Airways to get into code-share pact | Zee Business,IndiGo and Qatar Airways to get into code-share pact. The market has also been rife with speculation about Qatar Airways," IndiGo, the country's largest private carrier, is all set to announce a strategic code-share partnership with Qatar Airways, months after it put on hold active discussions in the matter. The two carriers are expected to announce the details of the partnership on Thursday.  ""About 5-6 months back, IndiGo and Qatar Airways were actively discussing a code-share partnership. In between, IndiGo announced code-share with Turkish Airlines. Now, it seems they have finalised the deal with Qatar Airways,"" said an industry executive. The development assumes significance in the wake of the government move to sell Air India and the two airlines may jointly bid for the national carrier.  The market has also been rife with speculation about Qatar Airways buying a stake in IndiGo. Ever since IndiGo became eligible to fly overseas, it has been aggressively expanding its flight and frequency on foreign routes. A marketing or deeper alliance with Qatar Airways will lend it better connectivity. To Qatar Airways, it would offer a deeper penetration in the Indian market. Watch Zee Business Live TV below: Investors seem aware of the benefit of the partnership as IndiGo stock rose 1.77 per cent on the BSE to Rs 1,461.45 a piece on Tuesday. IndiGo reported a net loss in the September quarter at Rs 1,066 crore from Rs 652 crore in the same period last year. The airline remains bullish despite the losses.
