More price reductions in","UPDATED 8 MONTHS AGO Airline stocks’ performance has gone downhill since the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Most industries were hit, but the travel industry took a bigger blow. The Street stated that the industry trade group estimates that global airline sales could fall by $314 billion this year. Airline stocks are trading in the red. In April, United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) has declined by 18.45, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has fallen by 21.2%. Meanwhile, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ:SAVE) have fallen by 15.9%, 15.3%, and 8.4% in April. Since the pandemic started, the travel demand has been hit hard due to restrictions, lockdowns, and self-quarantine rules imposed by health authorities. United Airlines reported losses of $2.1 billion in its first-quarter preliminary results announced on Monday. The company also had to sell 22 planes to BOC Aviation to survive the current cash crunch. Later this week, Delta followed suit and reported lower revenues and higher losses in its first quarter. To learn more, read Delta Air Lines: Q1 Losses Depict Airline Industry’s Struggles. The airline industry’s struggles are evident in declining stock prices. Wall Street analysts are bearish about most of these stocks. As a result, analysts reduced their target prices. After Delta’s results, JPMorgan Chase cut the target price for the stock to $45 from $46. Raymond James cut the target price to $36 from $40, while Evercore ISI reduced the target price to $30 from $35. Cowen and Company cut the target price for Delta to $33 from $35.

1,Why Is Warren Buffett Selling His Airline Stocks? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why Is Warren Buffett Selling His Airline Stocks?. Buyer turned seller. Uncharacteristic,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | April 24, 2020 | More on: QSR QSR Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway has a $128 billion war chest. In previous market crashes, the renowned value investor usually goes bargain hunting. But this time, you can sense the fear. Why the sudden change? Buffett mentioned in a recent interview that the coronavirus outbreak and oil price war are the one-two punch he hasn’t seen before. Talks are ripe that the billionaire investor would again be making substantial moves. Among the major companies for which Buffett extended financial help before were Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and General Electric. He pumped in roughly US$13 billion in the companies. Several industries such as entertainment, hotel, and travel are presently experiencing distress, and they are all on the radar. Buffett, however, made a surprising U-turn as the buyer turned seller. Three weeks earlier, Buffett said he was not selling his airline stocks. But at the start of April 2020, Berkshire sold nearly $390 million worth of shares in Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines. The hammering by the coronavirus pandemic was too much to bear already. His conglomerate was losing $5 billion on its stock holdings in the airline industry. As a result of the sale, shares of both airline companies plummeted. The dumping of airline stocks is uncharacteristic. Buffett has consistently maintained a long-term view that exiting from a position is not his cup of tea. His second-in-command at Berkshire, Charlie Munger, is defending the non-buying stance. According to Munger, Berkshire is not moving to buy and profit from lower prices because another market crash could happen. Since Berkshire doesn’t know what to do with its investment portfolio, the prudent action is to do nothing. The Berkshire vice chairman said it’s one of the keys to good investment results. Buffett views the current crisis as the worst ever in his lifetime. The primary goal is to get through the typhoon and come out of it with a whole lot of liquidity. Because the market is acting crazy, expect Buffett to remain motionless and not buy into businesses at this point. With the closing of fast food operations, Buffett might be considering selling his Restaurant Brands International (TSX:QSR)(NYSE:QSR) stock holdings. Thus far, there are no indications or news. The stock performance of this $19.25 billion company in 2020 is similarly causing alarm. RBI’s","Apr 24, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/04/24/why-is-warren-buffett-selling-his-airline-stocks/
2,Could This Airline Stock Be the Contrarian Bet of the Decade? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Could This Airline Stock Be the Contrarian Bet of the Decade?. Chorus,"      Vishesh Raisinghani | April 24, 2020 | More on: CHR The airline industry has been at the epicentre of the ongoing crisis. Flights across the world have virtually stopped. Air traffic fell off a cliff when most countries implemented stay-at-home policies in March. Airline stocks followed the nosedive.  Top airline stocks such as Air Canada have lost nearly two-thirds of their market value year to date. With demand suppressed and debt costs rising, these major airlines could be squeezed further. Some major airlines in other parts of the world have already declared bankruptcy, and even Warren Buffett seems to have abandoned the industry.  Things look as bleak as they could possibly be. This could create an opportunity for a keen contrarian investor looking for a distressed asset. Here’s one Canadian airline stock I believe investors could add to their “distressed” watch list for 2020.  Much like the rest of the airline industry, Chorus Aviation (TSX:CHR) has lost value this year. The stock is down over 64.8% year to date. Investors seem justifiably pessimistic.  However, Chorus isn’t a traditional airline company. The business model is based on regional routes and chartered flights. In other words, the company operates within Canadian borders. It also doesn’t sell tickets but leases aircrafts out to bigger carriers.  It’s biggest customer, of course, is Air Canada. Air Canada has signed a long-term multi-year deal to lease the company’s aircrafts. These smaller planes fly between Canadian cities and provinces under the Jazz and Air Canada Express brands.  As you can imagine, the outlook for regional flights is better than international flights. Due to the pandemic, I believe travellers will more likely travel domestically rather than risk going abroad for the next year or so. That fact means Chorus’s business could be at the forefront of the recovery for the airline industry.  Meanwhile, 90% of the company’s sales are secured by long-term contracts with major airlines. This puts Chorus in a great position to weather the ongoing storm.  Since the stock has lost two-thirds of its value, the valuation seems ludicrously attractive. The company’s market value is just $452.5 million at the moment. That’s 25% less than book value and only 33% of annual sales.  A recovery to book value alone could deliver double-digit returns for investors.

4,Airlines Stocks Look Awful While Stock Market Risk Clearly Defined - Heritage,"Airlines Stocks Look Awful While Stock Market Risk Clearly Defined. Share:. Paul Schatz, President, Heritage Capital. Blog Categories. BLOG. INVESTING.","Yesterday, I wrote about my anger and disgust regarding the airline  bailout. That won’t change anytime soon. Today, I want to look at the group and how they have been trading. Below you can see a chart of the airlines as represented by the JETS ETF. Besides declining 65% from high to low since the market’s peak, notice how little green is on the chart. Green days mean the closing price is that much higher than the opening price. Red means the opposite, the close was lower than the open. Red days show that emotion ruled the opening but smarter minds prevailed by the close as the airlines closed lower since the open. That’s typically a sign of moving exiting a sector. Even since the bottom last month, we have only two green days, not exactly the pillar of strength.  Moreover, for all those hanging your hat on the notion that a government bailout will mean great things for the stock, think again. While a bailout might avoid Chapter 11 where many of them belong, I will argue that it will prevent the airlines from recovering anytime soon and perhaps not even by 2025 or 2030. Those that could survive should do so without aid and those that can’t should take advantage of the bankruptcy laws and file to reorganize without the debt overhang. Finally for this update, I want to show you two charts below that I posted on Twitter yesterday. The first one shows the number of stocks going up on all days since the March 23 bottom. On most up days, we see 2000 stocks advancing, an extreme number.  Below is the opposite chart, stocks going down every day since early March. On down market days, we usually see at least 2000 stocks going down. In other words, the stock market has become an all or none proposition as the computer driven algorithms have completely dominated.  On Wednesday I concluded with my thought that the bulls were supposed to come back to work after a two-day, 1000 point decline. They did a nice job. Over the coming days the bulls need to keep going and close above last week’s high which is 24,300 in the Dow and 2880 in the S&P 500. Without doing that, there is downside risk to 22,500 and 2640 respectively. Stay safe and healthy!

I bought into a revolutionary tech-savvy wellness company, but","   I've been a net buyer of stocks lately, but not this week. I unloaded a few of my holdings on Tuesday and Wednesday, including one market laggard that I've owned for nearly a decade. I made just one new stock purchase this week, initiating a position in Livongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) on Tuesday.  Livongo Health is tackling health and wellness in a differentiated way, leaning on its growing collection of data and artificial intelligence to arrive at better outcomes. It started out tackling diabetes, with data scientists translating health data into personalized actionable health signals. The end result is a win-win, with the average member seeing a dramatic improvement in blood sugar levels and employers saving on healthcare costs.  Livongo Health has gone on to add weight management, hypertension, and behavioral health to its growing portfolio. Earlier this month it reported preliminary financial results that it will make official in early May. It sees $65.5 million to $66.5 million in revenue for the first three months of this year, well ahead of the $60 million to $62 million it initially offered as guidance, and more than double the $32.1 million it delivered a year earlier. Now let's talk about the stocks I cut loose. I sold my shares in Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), Delta (NYSE:DAL), and Ford (NYSE:F) this week. Let's go over why I let them go. IMAGE SOURCE: LYFT. The country's second-largest ride sharing company is up on blocks these days. The same company that saw its revenue skyrocket 68% higher last year is now struggling with shelter-in-place orders that are gnawing away at demand. Lyft has withdrawn its earlier guidance like so many companies have these days, but a third-party source claims that gross bookings appear to be down a whopping 75%.  Unlike global market leader Uber (NYSE:UBER), Lyft hasn't gone the Uber Eats route by offering takeout delivery, which is a thriving part of the top dog's business. Lyft is testing out the delivery of essentials, but it may be too little, too late on that front.  I don't know what I was thinking when I figured that airlines getting pounded when the sell-off began in late February was a buying opportunity.

6,Delta Makes Its Case It Can Fly Through the Coronavirus Crisis | The Motley Fool,Delta Makes Its Case It Can Fly Through the Coronavirus Crisis. The airline had a lousy first quarter and expects,"   Delta Air Lines' (NYSE:DAL) first-quarter results were, as expected, terrible, and management expressed confidence that the second quarter will be even worse. But for airlines right now it isn't about gaudy numbers; it's about survival. And despite the losses, Delta made a strong case that the airline can remain airborne through the turbulence. Here's a close look at the quarter, and what Delta management expects in the months to come. Before markets opened Wednesday, Delta reported a first-quarter loss of $0.51 per share on revenue of $8.6 billion, compared to analyst expectations for a $0.70 per share loss on sales of $8.9 billion. Revenue was off 18% year over year. ""The first quarter of 2020 has truly been like no other in our history,"" CEO Ed Bastian said on a post-earnings call with investors. ""These are truly unprecedented times and the path to recovery is uncertain and will likely be choppy."" IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. With demand nearly nonexistent, Delta has been scrambling to raise cash and buy itself time for travel to normalize. The company said it has raised $5.4 billion since early March, including a $3 billion secured term loan and $1.2 billion in aircraft sale/leaseback deals. Delta also drew down $3 billion under existing revolving credit facilities and secured a separate $5.4 billion in payroll support from the U.S. government in the form of loans and grants. The airline said it expects to end the second quarter with about $10 billion in liquidity, up from $6 billion at the end of the first quarter. That would imply additional fundraising efforts are on the horizon. Earlier in the week, United Airlines Holdings demonstrated it's possible to raise equity funding in this environment. But given that Delta shares are off 61% year to date, it seems more likely management will try to use some of its $13 billion in unencumbered assets as collateral to raise additional funds, or potentially try to do more sale/leaseback deals. Delta is also making progress on the cost side, forecasting total expenses in the second quarter will be down about 50% due to reduced flying and subsequent fuel savings, as well as consolidating airport facilities and temporarily closing airport lounges. It is also benefiting from 37,000 employees opting to take short-term unpaid leave, and from executive pay reductions. Delta has cut April capacity by 80% and is expecting to fly","Apr 24, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/24/delta-makes-its-case-it-can-fly-through-coronaviru.aspx

BTC-USD.,"                                                   American Airlines AAL is scheduled to report first-quarter 2020 results on Apr 30, before market open. Notably, the company’s bottom line surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters with in-line earnings in one. American Airlines Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   American Airlines Group Inc. price-eps-surprise | American Airlines Group Inc. Quote Against this backdrop, let’s delve into the factors that might have impacted the company’s performance in the March quarter. With coronavirus woes crippling air-travel demand, American Airlines’ first-quarter performance is likely to have taken a major hit. Even though passenger traffic might have been strong in January and February, air-travel demand started waning from March onward ever since the infection was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. This downside is expected to have weighed on American Airlines’ top line in the to-be-reported quarter. To mitigate the extremely low-demand scenario with many countries on lockdown and wide-spread travel restrictions in place, this Fort Worth, TX- based carrier is trimming its capacity, inducing cancellation of multiple flights. With traffic declining at a faster pace than capacity, consolidated passenger load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) is likely to have fallen in the to-be-reported quarter.  Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Airlines’ first-quarter passenger load factor stands at 80, indicating a 4.8% decline from the figure reported in fourth-quarter 2019. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter passenger revenue per available seat miles (a measure of unit revenues) stands at 13.53 cents, implying an 8.1% fall from the figure reported in the sequential quarter. However, low fuel costs are likely to have supported the bottomline in the to-be-reported quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for March quarter’s average fuel price is pegged at $1.87 per gallon, indicating an 8.8% decline from the number reported in fourth-quarter 2019.

VOLATILITY.," The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lockdown worldwide that is ravaging stock markets across the board. One of the worst-hit sectors in Canada’s economy is the airline industry. With a necessary ban on travelling to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, many prominent airline stocks have taken a beating on the TSX. Air Canada (TSX:AC) had a rough month in March 2020. Between January 13 and March 19, 2020, the stock’s share prices nosedived by a drastic 76%. With the announcement of the government’s stimulus package to help keep the economy afloat, the stock market is beginning to see a rally. The Air Canada stock is seeing positive shareholder sentiment as well. At writing, the stock is trading for $18.12, and is up 49% from its 52-week low of $9.26 from March. Investors who got in on the stock in March must be happy to see their investment bear fruit. However, the worst may be yet to come for the largest airline in the country. With an effective shutdown of its operations, Air Canada is not producing any significant revenue. The company is yet to announce its Q1 2020 earnings report. While the report is not out yet, it does not take a genius to figure out that the numbers will be a mess. Air Canada’s core operations have shut down. While the government’s support has bolstered its payrolls, the company is still refusing to grant refunds. It’s an indication that Air Canada is struggling with persisting cash flow problems. The situation can take a horrible turn for Air Canada unless it sees the support from a full-blown government bailout. If you are an investor in search of beaten-down stocks that can offer you substantial returns with a recovering market, there are better options to consider. To this end, today I’m going to discuss Toronto-Dominion Bank (TSX:TD)(NYSE:TD) stock. Toronto-Dominion is the second-largest banking sector operator in Canada in terms of market capitalization. It has grown faster than its peers over the last decade, thanks to its increasing exposure to retail banking in the United States.

By proceeding, you agree to our and .         How much of a hit has air travel taken during the COVID-19 pandemic? The short answer: Like nothing anyone has seen before. Even airline experts with long memories can’t remember a comparable impact of some critical event. Yes, 9/11 stopped air travel cold, but the immediate effect lasted weeks, not months. And the nation had a visible system in place—TSA screening—squarely aimed at preventing similar events in the future. Driving Between States During the Pandemic? Here’s What You Need to Know And while statistics vary depending on source and assumptions, public data makes clear that U.S. airline passengers are down about 90 percent for this time of year. International passengers are down at least as much, and domestic air travel in many parts of the world is also down, or shut off completely. Rewards site Upgraded Points recently put those staggering numbers into visuals, which offer a holistic view of the situation thus far. Here’s what stands out in terms of the about-face COVID-19 has forced upon travel, and data visuals by Upgraded Points that illustrate them. While very few people are flying (which we’ll refer to as foot traffic), air traffic is higher. As of late-April, about half of all U.S. domestic flights are regularly being canceled despite a 90 percent drop in foot traffic. The discrepancy between foot traffic and flights is explained by one simple fact: The recent U.S. stimulus bill that offered rescue funds for airports and airlines requires that U.S. airlines continue serving the points they usually serve—which they are doing, by flying virtually empty planes. Similar effects are seen in Asia and Europe, where foot traffic is down at least 75 percent and many airlines are not required to continue service. For example, Porter Airlines has suspended all flights, as has RyanAir and Royal Air Maroc. More carriers have suspended all international service, including South African Airways, Turkish, Avianca, and Qantas. The number of daily commercial flights flown globally has decreased by 76.5 percent. Airlines are having a tough time finding places to park their idle aircraft.

Warren Buffett is keeping quiet during the coronavirus crisis. We asked 8 casual investors to speculate on what he's,"   Getty Images / Spencer Platt  Warren Buffett has been unusually quiet for weeks as the coronavirus pandemic and oil shocks continue to rattle global markets, leading many to wonder what he's doing. The famed investor's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate boasted a $128 billion cash pile at the end of December, which Buffett has been itching to deploy for years. The recent market meltdown may have allowed him to bolster his portfolio at bargain prices. Moreover, companies ranging from airlines and casinos to hotels and cruise lines are suffering from travel restrictions and lockdowns in response to the coronavirus. They could look to Buffett for help, given he bailed out Goldman Sachs, General Electric, and other companies during the 2008 financial crisis.  Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, should spill a few of the beans at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting on May 2. In the meantime, we asked a bunch of investing enthusiasts on Reddit to speculate on what he's been up to.

He doesn't have time to ride out and profit from another long recession, so he's probably just getting his ducks in a row."" ""Berkshire has lost almost $100 billion in market capitalization, I'm sure Buffett isn't happy about it.

""My guess, he can't predict the trajectory of this crisis, and so can't do anything that doesn't reek of gambling. That's not his style.

A,"Getty Images If you find yourself in the enviable position of being able to ponder how to invest your stimulus check, thank your lucky stars … for plenty of reasons. As you're well aware by now, the $2 trillion CARES Act rescue package included stimulus checks of up to $1,200 for most individuals living in the U.S. The sad reality is, many Americans will need every cent of that for day-to-day basics. But more than a few people are fortunate enough to be able to put that money to work. Anecdotally, a few friends have already asked me about how to invest their recently deposited stimulus checks. And more people are sure to wonder the same as the Treasury proceeds with its disbursements. The good news? Despite how ugly the market looks right now – in many cases, because the market looks so ugly right now – you've got options. And plenty of 'em. Today, we're going to look at how to invest your stimulus check. Because everyone's risk tolerance is a little different, we'll be exploring a variety of options – conservative, aggressive and a little in between. 1 of 5 Getty Images Especially if you're a novice investor, one of the best things you can do with your stimulus check is to plunk it down into a boring index fund.
