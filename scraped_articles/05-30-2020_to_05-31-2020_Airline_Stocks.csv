0,Market Crash 2020: Is it Safe to Buy Canadian Airline Stocks? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Market Crash 2020: Is it Safe to Buy Canadian Airline Stocks?. Why,"      Andrew Button | May 31, 2020 | More on: AC CJT Airline stocks fared worse than most equities in the 2020 stock market crash. Whereas the TSX fell 37% from top to bottom, followed by a recovery, Air Canada (TSX:AC) fell 68% for the year and remains down. It’s a similar story with U.S. airlines. The situation has gotten so bad that Warren Buffett recently exited airlines entirely, citing long-term headwinds. Around the same time, Air Canada released a quarterly report stating that it didn’t expect to reach 2019 revenue levels for another three years. For investors, that’s a grim prospect. However, the question arises: Is it time to buy airlines on the dip? Although airlines are facing long-term pain, they will eventually recover. Their services are simply too important for them to be left to die. If an airline like AC really needs a bailout, it will probably get one. Knowing this, you may be tempted to buy such stocks on the dip. It would be wise to take a breather before doing that. Although, historically, low stock prices can be tempting for dip buyers, the headwinds facing airlines are going to last a long time. A surge back to all-time highs is not in the cards — at least not soon. Additionally, it’s possible that a future bailout could dilute equity and make airline stocks worth less. With that in mind, the following are a few things to be aware of if you’re considering buying airline stocks after the 2020 market crash. The big reason why airline stocks have fared poorly is because their revenue is down with no chance of a quick recovery. In its most recent quarter, Air Canada lost $1.05 billion and saw revenue decline by $712 million. That was with only one month of travel bans. In Q2, with three full months of lockdowns in the picture, revenue will be even lower. And it’s not clear that revenue will jump when the lockdowns are over. Individual travellers may remain wary, even after travel is technically permitted. The possibility for prolonged lower passenger miles was one of the reasons Warren Buffett sold all of his airline stocks. With all of the above being said, it’s important to remember that not all airlines are created equal. If you look at a company like Cargojet (TSX:CJT), it’s a night and day","May 31, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/05/31/market-crash-2020-is-it-safe-to-buy-canadian-airline-stocks/
1,Forget Air Canada (TSX:AC): This Airline Stock Is at All-Time Highs! - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Forget Air Canada (TSX:AC): This Airline Stock Is at All-Time Highs!. Air,"      Joey Frenette | May 30, 2020 | More on: AC CJT In the age of coronavirus, Air Canada (TSX:AC) is a hard stock to value. The stock’s trajectory will ultimately be determined by news relating to the coronavirus or the arrival of a vaccine. The airline stocks are, indeed, a speculative bet that not even Warren Buffett is comfortable making. In many prior pieces, I’ve outlined the fact that the coronavirus-related uncertainties have caused the lines between investment and speculation to be blurred for hard-hit industries such as the airlines. Sure, Air Canada could prove to be undervalued if a vaccine were to land tomorrow, but on the flip side, the stock could also be worth next to nothing if a worst-case scenario pans out and this pandemic lasts through 2021. Air Canada is a speculation, but it’s one that may be worth taking. For those, like Buffett, who have no desire to speculate, however, there is an airline stock out there that’s sound enough for your portfolio. Consider cargo airline stock Cargojet (TSX:CJT). The airline is not only resilient in the face of this unprecedented socio-economic crisis, but it’s also in a spot to thrive, as demand for its overnight shipping services is likely to remain stable amid this pandemic. Shares of Cargojet recently hit new all-time highs just north of the $140 mark, after nearly doubling off March bottoms. In a prior piece, I’d urged investors to load up on the stock, noting that the company was in a position to bounce back, given “the demand for overnight shipping will remain stable,” regardless of what ends up happening next with the coronavirus pandemic. “Although the name is pretty expensive at 68 times next year’s expected earnings, I’d argue it’s far better to pay up for a resilient name that isn’t dependent on the outcome of an exogenous event for its survival. Cargojet is riding on a secular e-commerce tailwind and will continue to fly high, as its commercial peers grind to a halt.” I wrote in a prior piece. Today, Cargojet stock is back to being expensive, with shares around 10% higher than they were back in early February. The stock trades at 3.7 times sales and 7.6 times book, both of which are higher than the stock’s five-year historical average multiples of 1.9 and 6.4, respectively. Clearly, investors have recognized and","May 30, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/05/30/forget-air-canada-tsxac-this-airline-stock-is-at-all-time-highs/

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the summer driving season fades in the rearview mirror, oil markets are taking on a distinctly chilly air.The recovery in demand has officially stalled, just as the OPEC+ countries are starting to taper their record output cuts. With spare capacity rife throughout the supply chain and huge stockpiles of crude and refined products, it may be some while yet before oil prices resume their upward path.After a strong initial rebound from the depths of the pandemic-induced slump, the comeback in demand slowed dramatically, as I’ve written here and here. This is most obvious in those countries that publish detailed data at high frequency, such as the U.S., the U.K. and some other European nations.That oil demand in India remains muted is particularly bad news for those wishing oil prices higher.

4,Is Alaska Air Group Stock a Buy? | The Motley Fool,Is Alaska Air Group Stock a Buy?. Airline shares have been hit hard by COVID-19. Is it safe to buy,"   Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) isn't the best-known airline nationally, but for years it has quietly been one of the industry's top performers, flying passengers up and down the west coast and blanketing the Pacific Northwest with flights. The airline flew into some turbulence in 2016 when it won a bidding war to acquire Virgin America, but entered 2020 with the integration largely complete, and Alaska once again focused on its core historical markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything for Alaska and the rest of the airline sector, causing travel demand to evaporate and starving the industry of revenue. Shares of Alaska have lost nearly 50% of their value year to date, and the airline has cut 80% of its planned capacity heading into June. The shares are more affordable than they were just a few months ago, but the risks are much higher as well. Is Alaska Air stock a good value or a value trap? Alaska lost $232 million in the first quarter of 2020 on revenue down 13% year over year. Those numbers don't speak to the full extent of the damage done by the pandemic, as the U.S. wasn't fully impacted by COVID-19 until near the end of the first quarter. The airline has parked more than 160 aircraft and sliced its schedule, trying to adjust to demand that at its worst was down 90% year over year. When second-quarter numbers come out in late summer, they will reflect a full three months of pandemic weakness, with only a trickle of revenue coming through the door. IMAGE SOURCE: ALASKA AIR GROUP. The focus is on cost-cutting. Alaska was burning through about $400 million in cash in late March but had that down to about $260 million by early May. The goal is to get to cash breakeven by year's end, which would give the airline substantial flexibility to weather even an extended downturn. It's too early to know how long the depressed demand will last, but the airlines came out of the Memorial Day weekend talking about hopeful signs of a gradual recovery. Alaska prior to the pandemic had been doing a good job trimming routes it inherited in the Virgin America deal that were not profitable. These routes mainly involved more costly cross-country flying to destinations where the company did not have a large number of loyal frequent flier customers.

11,10 Reasons the Stock Market Will Likely Crash Again,10 Reasons the Stock Market Will Likely Crash Again. The ongoing crisis will create financial uncertainty for months to come..,"Despite the fact that many saw it coming, the stock market crash of March 2020 took an enormous toll on global economies. Most G20 countries saw an economic downturn of 30 percent as a result of the global shutdown and widespread panic caused by the global health crisis. Although the stock market has been slowly rising back up over the past couple of weeks, many fear that we haven’t seen the last of its impact on Wall Street. While it’s possible that the situation could continue improving, it’s also not unlikely that we’re due for another crash soon. Another shock may well be coming, as millions of people and businesses fall behind on obligations such as mortgages and corporate loans. Here are 10 reasons why this could happen. Regardless of where you stand, the current lack of vaccine means there’s is at least a chance of countries being hit with a second wave of illness. Health officials and organizations around the world are warning of an impending ""second wave,"" i.e. a repeated increase in the numbers of new instances of infection. Estimates on when this might happen vary from the holiday season to early autumn. As many countries are beginning to lift restrictions and re-open businesses and public spaces, this might happen sooner rather than later. Related: 5 Ways This Crisis Is Changing Venture Capital Investment Strategy In the U.S. and many other countries, governments have provided stimulus packages for businesses and additional unemployment benefits for individuals. This cash injection might be partly responsible for the slight recovery of the stock market that we’ve seen in recent weeks. However, this was a temporary boost – once this money runs out, businesses and individuals will struggle again to pay mortgages, rent and will limit their spending, possibly leading to another rapid drop in stocks. Despite government help, many small businesses are struggling to keep afloat – and many others have already been forced to cut down on staffing or close down entirely. A continued decrease in small business activity will cause unemployment levels to remain elevated, negatively impacting the economy. Even once the threat has passed, we can’t realistically expect everything to go back to the way it was before this hit. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take months for businesses to return to full capacity – and for new companies to take the place of those that didn't","May 31, 2020",https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/10-Reasons-the-Stock-Market-Will-Likely-Crash-15303165.php
12,Would Delta Airlines (DAL) be a good buy for a long-term hold? - Quora,,"For the industry in general, low oil prices are a definite plus, and I don’t see that ending anytime soon. So I believe there is a lot of upside potential for the airline industry. It looks to me like Delta is strong enough to survive the current difficulties. Southwest is another good possibility. I do have some concerns about American Airlines, which isn’t nearly as strong. If you buy Delta, and hold it for several years, I suspect you’ll be alright. However, watching your stock lose half its value in the meantime can be rather demoralizing. I don’t believe we’ve seen the worst of this pandemi      I’m not buying any airline stocks. Even after this is all over the economy isn’t coming booming back. Traveling is something only those with extra money can afford including businesses. That said delta does have the best balance sheet in terms of debt and could perhaps take more market share from other airlines that go bankrupt. I’m sure it will recover at some point. If we are talking really long term the corona virus doesn’t have any effect. Rather you should be asking yourself: How has the travel industry been growing. Are planes the method of travel in the future? Most likely. Yes. The nex  I cannot see airlines in total being a good investment right now. Obviously people will still fly but the fear of contagion will cripple travel flights by 75% for the next year- probably two. What I do not know is the configuration of a plane as we go through this period. I know they are taking out middle seats to avoid proximity but what about those rows by the windows that have just two seats. When you think of that, planes will have to reconfigure their prices for far fewer consumers. Obviously the price will have to go up-probably substantially- in order for the operator to say in business. So        No airline on earth is or ever will be or ever has been…a good buy for the “long-term”. You might make money on a momentum trade or a turn around idea, but sell your profits (if you make em) in airlines and find a better business. Theres too much capital costs, ongoing operating costs and regulatory costs associated with airlines, and thats never going to change.","May 30, 2020",https://www.quora.com/Would-Delta-Airlines-DAL-be-a-good-buy-for-a-long-term-hold

Weirdest Economy Ever Finally, after watching how innumerable retail investors — enamored with betting in a convenient way on the price of US crude oil benchmark WTI — got systematically and predictably cleaned out year after year, the SEC and the CFTC are investigating certain aspects of the US Oil Fund [USO]. These types of funds don’t track the price of the commodity they claim to track, except in the very short term, and sometimes not even then. And long-term, by the way they’re structured and designed, they wipe out their buy-and-hold investors. But these funds are marketed to retail investors. This is USO from the beginning, having lost 18% per year on average since its inception (data via YCharts):  The SEC and the CFTC should also investigate the US Natural Gas Fund [UNG] which has a similar problem in not tracking the price of US natural gas over anything but the shortest period of time, and sometimes not even then, and systematically wiping out anyone sticking this into their portfolio. These are not funds that should be marketed to retail investors – but that’s who is buying them. Experienced traders and the pros can trade the actual futures. But retail investors find futures intimidating, and so they buy these funds, and get systematically wiped out, even if the underlying commodity trades their way. The US Natural Gas Fund is even worse than USO, having lost 31% per year on average since its inception (data via YCharts):  The shares of these funds have gone through innumerable and massive reverse stock splits to keep the share price above a few dollars so that they could continue to be traded on the NYSE Arca, rather than over the counter as shares with a value or fractional pennies. Given the collapse of USO, the site is finally warning about it. So what took US regulators so long? I don’t know either. But here are the details on the investigation into USO. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are investigating the most popular exchange-traded fund tracking crude oil prices, the United States Oil Fund, to ascertain if the fund has managed to properly disclose to investors the risks, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing three sources familiar","May 30, 2020",https://wolfstreet.com/2020/05/30/u-s-regulators-probe-investor-risk-disclosure-of-worlds-top-oil-etf-uso/

Much of the salary","                                           Days before it resumes service, low-cost carrier GoAir has revised the salary structure of its senior pilots, many of whom will see a cut of over 50 percent in their pay. For a few, depending on their flying hours, the cut could be as much as 65 percent. For instance, a senior captain could see his monthly gross salary plummet to Rs 2.5 lakh from over Rs 7 lakh. This is probably among the steepest salary cut seen in the industry till now. Along with the cut, the airline has also done away with some benefits, including variable allowance for flying more than 70 hours a month, deadhead allowance and incentive given during a layover. Deadhead is when a crew or pilot travels to a destination to assume duty. He or she doesn't work on that flight. In early May, GoAir promoters Nusli and Jeh Wadia had written to employees, stating that the airline has paid salaries to 40 percent of its employees, and the rest will be paid on a graded and deferred basis. Moneycontrol has reached out to the company for a response, and the story will be updated once the carrier replies. Follow our LIVE Updates on the coronavirus pandemic here The steps come just a few days before GoAir resumes operations, on June 1. It was the only airline not to restart services on May 25.

comments  Some of Britain's biggest business names face relegation from the FTSE 100 after the Covid-19 pandemic sent their shares plunging.  British Gas owner Centrica, Easyjet and ITV could all lose their blue-chip status in this month's reshuffle. Others threatened are cruise company Carnival and aerospace and defence group Meggitt.  The quarterly reshuffle will be based on tomorrow's closing values. Companies in line for promotion from the FTSE 250 index include cyber security group Avast, Ladbrokes owner GVC, emergency repairs firm Homeserve and medical device company Convatec.  Grounded: Struggling Easyjet could lose its blue-chip status in this month's reshuffle It could be the biggest shake-up since the financial crisis, reflecting huge share price moves during the virus crisis. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: 'The Covid-19 crisis has had a devastating impact on many companies and has been a help to very few. The next quarterly reshuffle looks like it will be one of the biggest in 20 years.  'Attention is starting to turn to recovery so we'll start to see which companies can emerge most successfully.' FTSE Russell, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange, reviews the membership of its indices every three months, reshuffling companies based on changes in share prices.  Admission to or relegation from the FTSE 100 is significant. Companies in the Footsie have their shares snapped up by tracker funds, and the list is seen as a safe harbour for pension fund cash.  For Centrica, dropping out will be a particularly bitter blow. The company has been part of the index in one form or another since British Gas was first privatised in 1986.  Its 600,000 small shareholders saw the value of their stock plummet by 86 per cent under former boss Iain Conn. He left in March and has been replaced by Chris O'Shea. Marks & Spencer, another Footsie stalwart, suffered the same fate as Centrica last year, having been a member since the index was founded in 1984.  The last FTSE 100 review was in March, before the virus crisis began to bite.
