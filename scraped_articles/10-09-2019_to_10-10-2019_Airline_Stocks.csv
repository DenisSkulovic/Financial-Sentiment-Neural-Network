0,Now Is the Best Season to Buy Airline Stocks    - WSJ,The Wall Street Journal. Now Is the Best Season to Buy Airline Stocks. Delta’s forecasts for the next quarter were,"The winter low season is the worst time of the year for airlines—and the best time of the year for holders of airline stocks. On Thursday, Delta Air Lines —the world’s largest airline by traffic—said that third-quarter earnings-per-share were 29% higher than a year earlier, thanks in great part to premium-ticket revenue. Delta’s stock slipped in premarket trading, likely because the company forecast rising costs, but that follows a 2% gain over the past five days against a flat market. Airline stocks, in general, have found favor with investors this week, despite being underperformers for most of the year. The rebound might seem counterintuitive as the global economy—to which airlines are notoriously exposed—continues to slow, but it follows a raft of positive news: American Airlines, Ryanair and easyJet recently have all upgraded their projections.

1,"3 Airline Stocks to Trade Now During Earnings Season: DAL, UAL, LUV | InvestorPlace",3 Airline Stocks to Trade Now. Airlines have improved their P&Ls but they still lack respect on Wall Street.. Airline," Source: Shutterstock Airline stocks used to be a bit of a joke on Wall Street. But this has changed quite a bit in recent times. Companies have since shored up their spending and have offset their lack of pricing power per unit by adding a bunch of income sources like bag and seat assignment fees. It seems that every time I fly, I almost have to pay for the oxygen I inhale while on the flight. But lately, the headlines relating to airline stocks have more to do with the Boeing 737 Max model than the companies’ fundamentals. Just this week we learned about more official delays in redeployment estimate dates. Regardless, I want to examine the opportunities in three airline stocks. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). These stocks will be reacting to headlines now that we are entering a new round of earning reports for the sector starting today. Case in point, DAL stock this morning fell 3.7% on its earnings report — in spite of a 28% earnings increase and boring guidance. So the short-term reaction to these events is completely binary. We don’t know what management will say nor do we know how investors will react. Year-to-date, LUV stock is in line with the S&P 500 while DAL and UAL are lagging by at least half. Regardless, DAL, UAL and LUV are stuck in a wide range so all three have opportunity lines to trade. 11 ELECTRIC VEHICLE STOCKS TO BUY FOR 2021  The last time I wrote about DAL stock I cautioned against chasing the upside. DAL at the time had just spiked 20%. Immediately after my note, it corrected 13% and fell back into its breakout neckline. Luckily for Delta bulls, the stock recovered — and more. This is a picture-perfect example as to why investors need to be honest with their trading thesis. Often, we tend to get emotional and make mistakes. So what about the DAL opportunity now? Fundamentally, nothing has changed for DAL stock. It is still cheap as it sells at a 7.8 trailing price-to-earnings ratio and 0.7 times sales. It also pays a dividend twice that of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, so clearly there is not a lot of froth to shed. But that alone doesn’t mean that it can’t fall or that it has to rally from here. Value stocks","Oct 10, 2019",https://investorplace.com/2019/10/3-airline-stocks-to-trade-now/

USD/JPY.,"                                                   In the past week, American Airlines AAL revised its projection on total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) for third-quarter 2019. Despite the negative impact of Hurricane Dorian, the new projection was impressive and consequently found favor with investors. American Airlines also extended the grounding period of Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet by more than a month. The carrier has 24 such jets in its fleet. Latin-American carrier GOL Linhas GOL also provided an upbeat view pertaining to third-quarter passenger unit revenues (PRASK) backed by a strong demand for air travel. GOL Linhas is scheduled to release its third-quarter 2019 results on Oct 31. Also, Azul AZUL grabbed headlines owing to its upbeat September traffic report. Azul’s decision to start operations on the busy Rio de Janeiro-São Paulo routefrom Aug 29, 2019, aided traffic report. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines LUV suspended operations for two Boeing 737 Next Generation (NG) jets in its fleet after finding cracked parts in them. The low-cost carrier has reported its findings to Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here). Recap of Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. American Airlines now expects third-quarter 2019 TRASM to increase between 1.5% and 2.5% (old guidance: increase in the 1-3% band). The raised guidance is primarily based on higher yields. Non-fuel unit costs are still expected to increase between 4% and 6%. Pre-tax margin, excluding special items, is projected in the range of 6.5-7.5% for the to-be-reported quarter (old guidance: 5.5-7.5% range). Additionally, fuel costs are now estimated between $2.03 and $2.08 per gallon for the September quarter (old guidance: $2.05-7$2.10 range). The carrier, which canceled 9,475 flights in the July-September period due to the Boeing 737 Max groundings, expects the cancellations to hurt its pretax income to the tune of approximately $140 million in the to-be-reported quarter. American Airlines extended the grounding period of such jets until Jan 15, 2020 from Dec 3, 2019, expected earlier.

7,Honeywell's Earnings Will Interest Every Industrials Investor | The Motley Fool,Honeywell's Earnings Will Interest Every Industrials Investor. Previewing the upcoming report of the one the highest quality industrial stocks.. The,"   Honeywell (NYSE:HON) investors find themselves in an unusual position going into its third-quarter earnings. The company has been raising full-year sales and earnings guidance through 2019, and has arguably been doing it conservatively, but it still faces some near-term headwinds. Let's look at what to expect from the earnings report and why it matters to so many other industrial companies. Whether its Honeywell, or its peers General Electric (NYSE:GE) and United Technologies (NYSE:RTX), the theme of 2019 has been consistent: Aerospace remains the strongest industry performer. In particular, the commercial aerospace aftermarket has been extremely strong and has generally surpassed expectations. For example, United Technologies raised its estimate for Collins Aerospace full-year aftermarket organic sales growth to high single digits, from low to mid single digits, on its second-quarter earnings call. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Meanwhile, the chart below shows just how strong Honeywell's and GE's aftermarket sales have been in 2019. It's not entirely clear how much of this is down to the Boeing 737 MAX going out of service -- meaning older aircraft are being flown to fill the gap -- and how much is sustainable growth. No matter the reason, the commercial aerospace aftermarket has been very strong in 2019. But how long can it continue? DATA SOURCE: COMPANY PRESENTATIONS. Frankly, it's hard to anticipate because, on the one hand, the commercial aftermarket has been very strong in 2019. On the other hand, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has argued that the global purchasing managers' index (PMI) ""has historically been a useful leading indicator"" for passenger traffic (and therefore aftermarket demand) and there's no doubt PMI and other business survey data have been weaker in recent months. As you can see below, it has clearly weakened in the last few months, and the IATA described the start of the peak season in July as being soft. As anyone who invests in airline stocks knows, the industry tends to be cyclical.  US ISM MANUFACTURING PMI DATA BY YCHARTS. Honeywell's guidance for organic sales growth in the third quarter is a conservative-looking 2% to 4%, and there's a reason. As CEO Darius Adamczyk has previously outlined, 60% of Honeywell's revenue comes from short-cycle businesses. These businesses give a shorter time between initial contact and sales and are therefore more susceptible to an unexpected slowdown in the economy. DATA SOURCE: HONEYWELL PRESENTATIONS.

8,7 Great Value Stocks You Can Buy But Warren Buffett Can’t | WTOP,"7 Great Value Stocks You Can Buy But Warren Buffett Can’t. More on WTOP. . Maryland, Virginia donate vaccine doses","U.S. News & World Report | @usnews October 10, 2019, 8:00 PM You can buy these stocks, but Warren Buffett can’t. Warren Buffett once said he could earn returns of 50% a year — if only he had less money. Why? It’s far easier to make $210,000 double than $210 billion — the size of Berkshire Hathaway’s (ticker: BRK.A, BRK.B) equity portfolio. Buying a small- or mid-cap stock simply can’t meaningfully move the needle for Berkshire, and even if it was reasonable, BRK couldn’t buy a substantial stake without driving the price up or becoming a majority owner. Instead, the stocks Buffett has to buy are almost all mega-cap stocks, and to outperform an index he has to concentrate his bets. Berkshire’s top 10 holdings make up 82% of its portfolio. The average valuation of a top-10 holding is $240 billion. Make use of your advantage: here are seven value stocks to buy that would make Buffett envious. Safety Insurance Group (SAFT) Buffett’s business of choice, famously, is insurance. For decades now, the Oracle of Omaha has been buying up insurers, then using the premiums collected to invest in more high-quality businesses. Safety Insurance Group, a Boston-based property and casualty insurer, makes its bread and butter selling car insurance, and the actuaries and underwriters have done their jobs, with SAFT stock advancing from $40 in 2012 to $100 today. Another strong reason SAFT makes the cut among the best would-be “Warren Buffett stocks” is its lovely combination of a 3.7% dividend and no long-term debt. Plus, if Berkshire did deign to buy this stock, it would fold into Berkshire-owned Geico beautifully. CBIZ (CBZ) If you look at Berkshire Hathaway’s stock portfolio, it doesn’t take long for certain patterns to emerge. For example, Buffett’s top eight holdings are all either consumer goods stocks or financials. But the ninth-largest position is Moody’s Corp. (MCO), which is in the services sector, and technically shares an industry (business services) with CBIZ. CBIZ offers services and solutions for small- and mid-sized businesses, mostly centered around managing finances and employees. Accounting, handling taxes, even consulting on valuation, risk and mergers and acquisitions — CBIZ is almost like a mini Goldman Sachs (GS) in that respect. Yet another reason a poorer Buffett might consider this when perusing for the best stocks to buy: Berkshire owns $3.7 billion in Goldman shares, or 5% of the overall company.

While that would mean attractive fares for travellers, airlines — already operating on a wafer-thin margin — may risk their profitability to fill up cabins in a slowing economy. Capacity addition in the Indian aviation scene is in sharp contrast to other sectors such as automobile and consumer goods.

Investors may have missed the point that upcoming cost escalation is in,"   Delta Air Lines' (NYSE:DAL) fiscal third-quarter earnings report, issued Thursday, revealed that the airline continues to capitalize on brisk passenger demand as it heads into the year-end travel season. Shares of the legacy carrier were down roughly 3% at midday, however, as shareholders panned unit cost escalation both in the current quarter and in projections for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. Note that all comparative numbers in the discussion that follows refer to those of the prior-year quarter. DATA SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. Here are the salient details from the last three months: IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In Delta's earnings press release, CFO Paul Jacobson commented on both year-to-date costs and the benefits of the carrier's cash-generation prowess: We are making important investments in our people and facilities to drive sustainable growth in our business. Unit cost performance in 2019 of approximately two percent is consistent with our long-term target. ... With $7.5 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date, our strong cash generation sets Delta apart in the industry, and allows us to maintain consistent reinvestment in our business, an investment grade balance sheet and substantial cash returns to shareholders. The simple inference from Jacobson's commentary is that investors should focus on longer-term cash returns rather than on often-volatile quarterly fluctuations in unit costs. For the final quarter of the fiscal year, Delta is expecting earnings per share of between $1.20 and $1.50. The company anticipates average fuel price per gallon, inclusive of taxes and its refinery operations, of $2.00 to $2.20. Management believes adjusted TRASM will advance by 0% to 2%, while CASM ex-fuel is slated to rise by 4% to 5%. Delta plans an increase in system capacity of roughly 4.5% in the fourth quarter. While shareholders were disappointed with the projected year-end rise in unit costs, CEO Ed Bastian noted in an interview with Reuters Thursday morning that the airline is currently hiring pilots, staff, and flight attendants to meet strong demand partially due to rival carriers' grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft. Thus, climbing unit costs shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a failure of execution; rather, the escalation is in service of additional incremental revenue, which will deliver higher operating income, though at a lower margin, in the fourth quarter. Today's slight sell-off pushes Delta stock further into value territory.

With only 13 months left until election day, United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker and Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly have all donated to the right-leaning Responsibility and Freedom Work PAC.

The breakout for the airline CEOs were: Another top figure in the industry, Airlines for America’s senior vice president of legislative and regulatory policy Sharon L. Pinkerton, also recently donated $1,000 to the political action committee, according to Federal Election Committee reports. None of the top airline executives donated to the PAC prior to this upcoming election cycle, and marks the first time the three have not been associated with political action committees that equally contribute money to both Democrats and Republicans alike, according to the travel industry web site Skift.

Young,"Boeing 737-A23 (Photo by Bruce Bennett)  An often-quoted expression today is, “he’s got extra baggage.” Meaning of course, he’s got tons of problems that follow him around. For the airline industry extra baggage and overweight baggage means financial nirvana…cha-ching. Without lifting a finger the airlines have increased their revenues dramatically. In 2018 the 11 major airlines seamlessly generated $4.9 billion in baggage fees according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. As the global middle class expands and increases its travel, airlines are cashing in big time. A mere $5 per bag increase mounts up like a fast take-off. Here’s some hard data by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation for 2019: PROMOTED Baggage Fees By Airline, Q1 & Q2, 2019 Airline YTD June 30, 2019 Alaska $155,222 Allegiant $137,586 American $667,851 Delta $489,763 Frontier $192,956 Hawaiian $42,700 JetBlue $174,451 Southwest $25,774 Few of us can travel with only a carry-on bag. So with the flood gates open, the major carriers will never turn back and reduce baggage fees. Baggage fees are only one cog in the airline industry’s revenue machine. They charge for everything unless you travel First or Business class. It took decades and multiple bankruptcies for the airline industry to learn how to be profitable. But they finally did. Add to that the continuing upward mobility of the global middle class that is traveling. It’s true the airline industry is cyclical; a robust global economy helps increase revenues, earnings, and bond interest coverage. A slowdown or recession pinches margins, turning the once rosy scenario peaked. Baggage fee revenues are certainly not an exclusive reason to invest in airline bonds, but it’s an often-overlooked revenue source that is permanent. Couple that with the stable economy, unemployment at a 50-year low, available discretionary income, and airline bonds are a pretty safe bet. The first rule is to invest only in major airline carriers: American Airlines, Delta, Southwest and United. The risk of smaller carriers is not worth it—you aren’t going to earn additional yield on their bonds. Airline bonds we recommend are: Southwest Airlines 3.45% due November 16, 2027 (CUSIP: 844741BE7). Bonds trade around 105 for a 2.75% yield to maturity.

15,Portfolio Diversification: Four Common Mistakes Investors Make,Portfolio Diversification: Four Common Mistakes That Investors Make. Owning 10 Technology Stocks: . Holding Stocks In Covertly-Related Industries:. Diversifying with,"When it comes to portfolio diversification, investors are taught from an early age that they should not put all their eggs in one basket. By investing in a well-rounded portfolio you can still maintain your returns while decreasing your risk.  What does that mean in practical terms? Think about a portfolio where you had put all your money in General Electric (GE) for example. Over the past two years, GE has lost almost 60% of its value. If that was your one holding, your portfolio would be worth 60% less than it was two years ago. On the other hand, if you had 5 equally-weighted stocks, then the GE losses would still hurt, but not nearly as much. And if the other 4 stocks were up—your portfolio might actually have made money. Portfolio diversification should handle not only bad company mismanagement, but also mitigate the impacts from other shocks to the market, such as: So to really diversify, it is important to not just buy more stocks, but also move some of your money into sectors of the market that will protect the investor from the above swings. Sometimes that is easier said than done. So below, I have put my list of the most common portfolio diversification mistakes that an investor can make: Tech has been on a hot streak, and there are plenty of household names that all have terrific track records. It is not uncommon to see an investor buy 10 of the stocks, and think that he has diversified his risk away. Wrong! Trends in the market come and go. Tech stocks are not immune to the changing moods of investors, and they can be out of favor as quickly as they have been in favor. A good example is the fourth quarter of 2018 where the Chinese trade war kicked up and dropped tech stocks much faster than all other sectors. Tech is fine, and should be part of a portfolio, but in moderation. Airline stocks and Auto stocks are completely different right? One is related to business and leisure travel and one is a major household purchase, so they should be good diversified industries, right? NO!
