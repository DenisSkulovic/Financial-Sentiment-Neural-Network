0,"Forget Airline Stocks, These 3 Stocks Are Better Buys Right Now | The Motley Fool","Forget Airline Stocks, These 3 Stocks Are Better Buys Right Now. Here are three stocks that are going places.. Bet","   It's been a tough year for airline investors, with COVID-19 eating into global travel demand and causing airline stocks to slump. Given the continued risk caused by the pandemic, it's hard to enthusiastically buy into airline stocks right now. But the underlying need to go from point A to point B has not disappeared, and there are a lot of interesting companies in the business of providing transportation. Here's why three Fools contributors think AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) are better buys than airlines right now. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Lou Whiteman (AerCap): When airlines go bankrupt, equity holders are typically wiped out, but the planes keep on flying. If you are bullish on aviation but unsure about individual carriers, why not invest in the planes instead of in the airlines? AerCap is one of a small number of companies focused on buying planes directly from manufacturers and leasing them back to airlines. It is a model that many airlines have adopted in recent years as a way to operate asset-light and take debt off of their balance sheets. That's a dangerous business to be in if airlines can't pay their bills, and AerCap shares are down 50% year to date due to the weakness of their customers. But AerCap is set up well to be a survivor. The company has reworked its order book to limit the number of new planes it needs to place with airlines over the next few years and has all of its new deliveries between now and December 2021 leased. AerCap has been forced to work with customers to defer lease payments, a blow to near-term results. But the company has more than $11 billion in available liquidity to fall back on. It also has more than $25 billion in unencumbered assets, mostly planes, that it can borrow against if needed. It also has one of the newer fleets in the industry, meaning if any of its customers do get in trouble and have to return planes to AerCap, the company should be able to place those planes elsewhere. It's difficult to imagine AerCap shares staging a full recovery until the aviation sector gets back on track, but it is also hard to come up with a scenario where AerCap gets in financial trouble due to the downturn. That can't be said about all of the airlines.","Sep 5, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/05/forget-airline-stocks-these-3-stocks-are-better-bu/
1,Should You Buy or Sell Airline Stocks Right Now? | The Motley Fool,"Should You Buy or Sell Airline Stocks Right Now?. Are companies in the airline sector a good value, or a","   Airline stocks are currently stuck in a holding pattern. Shares of U.S. airlines have rebounded off their spring COVID-19 lows, but are still down big for the year as the pandemic continues to depress travel demand. The industry has scrambled to cut costs and fly through the turbulence, but at this moment there is a lot more fear surrounding the sector than greed. Warren Buffett famously advised to be greedy when others are fearful, but then again he joined the stampede for the exits and sold his airline stocks due to the pandemic. So what's an investor to think about the airlines right now? Here's a look at where things stand with the industry.  AIRLINE DATA BY YCHARTS. For all the issues the industry faces today, there hasn't yet been a U.S. airline bankruptcy. That's unusual for the airline business, where historically we've seen Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filings, and occasional liquidations, whenever the economy went south. But the industry entered this crisis in far better health than it has been in decades, and carriers have been able to raise billions in new cash to help offset the tens of millions of dollars they're burning through daily. U.S. airlines have raised about $50 billion in debt and equity financing, coupled with a similar amount of government assistance. The result is an industry that has done a remarkably good job of stabilizing itself in a difficult environment. The airlines will likely report substantial losses through the remainder of 2020, at least, but even the weaker carriers have enough cash and levers to pull to make it well into 2021 before facing liquidity issues. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The cost-cutting is not done yet. Three of the nation's largest airlines have announced plans to cut thousands of jobs in October as government assistance dries up. Expect the entire industry to be much more focused coming out of the pandemic, as management teams use the crisis to overhaul their businesses. With the airline stocks all still down 25% or more for the year, the sector looks like good value assuming the airlines survive the crisis and eventually normalize. Even if the airlines survive, the business is going to be ugly for some time to come. Traffic bounced off of spring lows as the summer went on, indicating there is some pent-up demand for travel, but according to Transportation Security","Sep 5, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/05/should-you-buy-or-sell-airline-stocks-right-now/

A tale of,"      Victoria Hetherington | September 6, 2020 | More on: AC ONEX The pandemic has seen airlines getting their time in the spotlight — if not in the skies — as investors pick over their tickers in the hunt for momentum. Air Canada (TSX:AC) has been hogging the headlines in particular, generating reams of hot takes while its fleet remained largely grounded. But what of WestJet? Today, we will take a quick look at these two airlines and ascertain whether one of them is a better name to buy than the other. You can’t buy WestJet stock anymore. However, what you can invest in is Onex (TSX:ONEX). But should you? The asset manager bought WestJet last year for a cool $3.5 billion. Talk about timing… But that acquisition could work out for airline investors who owned Onex and kept on holding. The stock has remained relatively unscathed in 2020, ditching 17% against Air Canada’s loss of almost 60% year on year. The signs are mounting that airlines are staging a comeback. While this is obviously fraught with risk (consider the potential for another way of coronavirus infections), an end to the pandemic is an inevitability. When it comes is less clear. But the good news is that investors should look forward to a period of post-pandemic growth. Leading the charge will be the sectors most affected and yet most capable of springing back. Air Canada, for instance, will be carrying out a voluntary COVID-19 study of arriving international travelers. This will be in conjunction with McMaster HealthLabs and the Greater Toronto Airports Authority. Meanwhile, WestJet and Vancouver International Airport will be testing some departing passengers. According to WestJet CEO Ed Sims, the initiative will “marry our expertise in passenger movements to science.” For a major airline to be combining expertise with science halfway through a pandemic is no doubt a welcome initiative. But for investors, the real clincher will be whether these two airlines can get customers back in the air in appreciable numbers. There are still a lot of unknowns, after all. From the reliability of a vaccine to the efficacy of masks, the end of the pandemic is not yet in sight. A recovery rally will happen eventually.

4,Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock: Time for a Comeback,. . . . . . . . Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock: Time for a Comeback?. Extended border restrictions. Is,"      Adam Othman | September 5, 2020 | More on: AC Airlines across the globe are facing the same woes as Air Canada, but relatively fewer are faring as bad. Even airline stocks across the border are recovering better than Air Canada. Out of three major European airlines, only one stock is down as much as Air Canada’s. But this might finally be changing. Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock showed some life in the past two weeks. From the monthly low on the 18th, the stock has surged about 13%, and it’s currently trading at $18 per share. The 14-day RSI is 61.48, which isn’t too near the overbought territory, but it’s heading there. It’s hard to say whether it’s a temporary reprieve or if the stock is finally rallying for good this time. This temporary strength that Air Canada stock is projecting is a bit peculiar if you consider the timing. The border restrictions that were supposed to be lifted by August-end have now been extended, all the way to October. One more month of travel restrictions might not seem that bad to small businesses, but for Air Canada, it’s 30 more days of bleeding cash — a few million every day. September would have been a month for Air Canada’s international travel’s recovery. Now, it’s one more month of scraping by. Even the people who can come to Canada have to comply with stringent isolation rules. It’s another thing stifling international travel, which is the bread and butter of Air Canada. The company recently announced the initiative to start posting testing booths on airports, so that passengers can be tested before they board. This will be available by September 7, and it’s expected to mitigate Air Canada’s role in spreading the virus. The company is also facing refund issues and will have to bow down the pressure sooner or later. Too many refund requests can put a severe dent on its already leaking coffers. The liquidity company raised to fight the pandemic-driven circumstances, and a fraction of the usual operational activity will start depleting even faster. Air Canada will release its third-quarter results near the end of October. Many investors might wait till then to tie up their capital to the company, because that will reveal how much the company improved upon the dismal second quarter in similar circumstances. The company will most likely","Sep 5, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/09/05/air-canada-tsxac-stock-time-for-a-comeback/

USD/JPY.,"                                                   United Airlines is gradually adding capacity with plans to fly 40% of its full schedule in October amid hopes of improvement in leisure travel. The company expects to fly 34% of its schedule in September. On September 4, United Airlines (UAL) announced that it is resuming services to 50 domestic routes and 14 international routes in October. The domestic routes include 37 from the airline’s Chicago, Denver and Houston hubs. The air carrier is adding additional flight services to 14 leisure destinations in Hawaii, Florida and Mexico. According to ADARA Traveler Trends Tracker, domestic air and hotel bookings for future travel have been slowly but steadily improving throughout the summer. Bookings were down 64% Y/Y at the end of August compared to 73% Y/Y in early July. The COVID-19 pandemic has been disastrous for airline companies as travel restrictions and growing virus cases have brought the industry to a standstill and led to losses of billions of dollars. Airlines have had to implement cost-cutting measures by cutting jobs and streamlining services in an effort to survive through the aviation crisis. Last week, United Airlines announced its plan to furlough over 16,000 jobs effective October 1 as the pandemic continues to weigh on global travel plans. Rival American Airlines also warned last month that it will furlough 19,000 jobs on October 1 as federal aid is running out. In an attempt to encourage passengers to book tickets, United Airlines decided to permanently cancel the $200 flight ticket change fees charged for travel within the US. (See UAL stock analysis on TipRanks). On September 2, Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik reiterated his Hold rating UAL stock while downgrading American Airlines and Delta Airlines and upgrading Southwest Airlines. Yanoshik, cut his industry revenue estimates by 20% for the second half of this year and by 15% for 2021.

CNBC Newsletters","Disney could have unveiled a bit of magic. Disney debuted its live-action blockbuster Mulan on its Disney+ streaming platform ahead of the long weekend. The film is available for a premium price months after its expected premiere back in March. Investors hope for another streaming smash hit similar to its Hamilton release earlier in the summer.  Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global says the house of mouse is about to make a very valuable move. “Disney+ has a lot of legs,” said Sanchez on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “Right now it’s a new shiny toy, and I think it’s going to remain that way. … I think this could be a very valuable move for Disney, and also to flex the muscle of their Disney+ streaming channel.” Disney has made a steady climb back from its March lows, but is still down nearly 9% for the year. The company was forced to shut the doors temporarily on many of its parks due to the Coronavirus pandemic, but Sanchez says that once things get back to normal, Djsney could outperform again.  “If you look at the things holding them back … the inability to open their parks, the challenges they have around sports,” said Sanchez. “Within the next six to12 months, we’re going to see some changes there that are going to be very beneficial to Disney, so I would actually think that as soon as we get back to a more normal situation, Disney could participate significantly more than the market.” Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, points out that although the stock is lagging, you shouldn’t count Disney out. “The stock actually hasn’t been acting all that badly,” Maley said during the same segment. “Even though it hasn’t been as aggressive in its rally as a lot of other stocks, it has still been making a series of “higher lows” and “higher highs” in a nice upward sloping trend channel.” Maley does point out that Disney is reaching some overbought levels, which is why it’s pulling back with the rest of the market. “One of the good things that could take place in the next week or two is that it would see a golden cross with the 50-day moving average moving above its 200-day moving average. 2 out of the last 3 times that has happened, the stock has rallied dramatically after that has","Sep 5, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/05/mulan-debut-allows-disney-to-flex-its-muscle-trader-says-heres-why.html
