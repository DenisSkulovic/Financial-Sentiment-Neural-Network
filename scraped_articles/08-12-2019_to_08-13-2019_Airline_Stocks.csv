0,Political Unrest and Trade War Impact Airline Stocks,Political Unrest and Trade War Impact Airline Stocks. Political unrest impacts airlines. Protest in Hong Kong. Intensifying US-China trade war.,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO US airline stocks fell on Monday. Overall, the airline industry appears to be bearing the brunt of political unrest and trade war worries. Most US airline shares closed in the red on Monday. Notably, American Airlines (AAL) stock fell the most with a decline of nearly 4%. United Airlines (UAL), Delta Airlines (DAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV) fell 2.6%, 1.5%, and 0.8%, respectively. The iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT) fell 1.7% on Monday. IYT invests in Dow Jones transportation stocks. IYT has allocated 20% of its funds to the airline industry. Intensifying anti-government protests in Hong Kong impacted the airline industry. One of the world’s busiest transportation hubs faced an operation halt on Monday. Thousands of demonstrators gathered across the Hong Kong airport. As a result, airport authorities had to cancel nearly 150 flights on Monday afternoon. Hong Kong residents protested China’s extradition bill. The legislation will allow Chinese authorities to transfer Hong Kong cases to mainland China. The government controls the courts in China. Meanwhile, the Chinese government suspended the bill without withdrawing it fully. The anti-government demonstration intensified over the last few weeks. China used police force against the protesters. The country deployed paramilitary troops across its southern border city, according to a report by The Washington Post on Monday. Rising political tension in Hong Kong might deter the Chinese government’s mega economic growth plans. Notably, the Hong Kong airport is the world’s busiest cargo airport. As a result, political unrest in the region would impact every business sector. Particularly, the unrest would impact the logistics industry. As a result, FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) shares fell 2% and 0.7%, respectively, on Monday. FedEx and UPS are the two largest air freight and logistics companies in the world. Rising trade tensions between the US and China played a crucial role in the stock market plunge. Recently, the trade war between the US and China intensified. President Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods. The Trump administration decided to levy 10% duties on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods starting on September 1. To counter the higher tariffs, China allowed its currency to weaken. The weaker yuan will help Chinese exporters offer better prices than foreign competitors. The People’s Bank of China set the yuan rates at 7.0211 per dollar on Monday. China’s central bank set the yuan exchange rate higher than 7","Aug 13, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/08/political-unrest-trade-war-impact-airline-stocks/

2,Mesa Air Group Stock Crashes 32% on Operational Problems | The Motley Fool,Mesa Air Group Stock Crashes 32% on Operational Problems. A spike in reliability problems came at the worst possible moment,"   One year ago, eight years after filing for bankruptcy, Mesa Air Group (NASDAQ:MESA) returned to the public markets, completing an IPO at $12 per share. The regional airline has taken investors on a bumpy ride since then, with the shares losing nearly half of their value. The latest turbulence struck near the end of last week. The company reported disappointing results for the third quarter of its 2019 fiscal year and its guidance raised the possibility that things could get even worse. Let's take a look at why Mesa Air Group stock plunged 32% on Friday and what the company would need to do to bounce back.  MESA AIR GROUP STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. At first glance, Mesa Air Group's Q3 earnings report might not look too bad. Revenue increased 4.9% year over year to $180 million. Adjusted pre-tax income reached $13.4 million, up 15.9% from $11.6 million a year earlier. While adjusted earning per share fell to $0.30 from $0.37 in the prior-year period, that was just a consequence of the company's IPO, which increased its share count. However, a look under the surface shows more cause for concern. Adjusted pre-tax income was $21 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and $25 million in the first quarter. Generally speaking, the spring season ought to be one of the most profitable times of the year, as that's when airlines tend to increase their aircraft utilization due to high travel demand. That wasn't the case for Mesa. The airline's two sequential declines in pre-tax income -- which have nearly cut its profit margin in half since the beginning of the fiscal year -- should be a big red flag for investors. Indeed, analysts had been expecting adjusted EPS to reach $0.55 last quarter. MESA'S PROFIT MAY HAVE BEEN UNSUSTAINABLY HIGH IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. Poor operational performance was the main driver of Mesa Air Group's sharp profit decline last quarter. Earlier this year, the company agreed to new contract terms with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) that would have enabled Mesa to earn incentive compensation for meeting specified operational targets. Unfortunately, the carrier fell well short last quarter. In early April, Mesa increased the number of spare aircraft it uses to support its regional flight operations for American Airlines from three to five. This was expected to improve its","Aug 12, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/12/mesa-air-group-stock-crashes-32-on-operational-pro.aspx
3,Delta Retools Its Regional Network -- and More Changes Are Coming | The Motley Fool,Delta Retools Its Regional Network -- and More Changes Are Coming. The airline giant will reduce the number of regional,"   For years, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and its fellow network carriers have signed contracts with numerous regional airlines to operate smaller jets on lower-traffic routes, mainly connecting their hubs to small and midsize cities. For example, United Airlines currently has eight airline partners in its United Express network. That level of complexity has been pretty common in recent years. However, Delta plans to change things up over the next 12 months. By this time next year, it will have just three regional airline partners operating Delta Connection flights, down from five today. This is a prelude to further shrinking its regional fleet -- already the smallest among the three big legacy carriers -- in favor of increased mainline service. DELTA PLANS TO SIMPLIFY ITS REGIONAL OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT YEAR. IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. Historically, Delta and its peers preferred to divide their regional flights among many regional airlines to minimize the potential disruption from labor disputes or other problems at any single regional affiliate. That model creates a lot of inefficiencies, though. Each regional affiliate needs its own reserve crews, its own aircraft spares, and its own maintenance department. This can lead to bloated costs. There's also a greater risk of flight cancellations when regional flights at a particular hub are operated by many different regional airlines, especially during periods of severe weather. There could be a spare aircraft and a reserve crew available to operate a flight, but if the aircraft and crew are associated with different regional airlines, the flight will be cancelled anyway. To simplify its Delta Connection network, Delta will end its relationship with Compass Airlines and GoJet by mid-2020. The two regional airlines, both of which are subsidiaries of Trans States Holdings, together operate 63 large regional jets under the Delta Connection brand. Most of those planes will be transferred to one of the three remaining Delta Connection carriers: SkyWest, Republic Airline, or Delta subsidiary Endeavor Air. A handful will be replaced with an equivalent number of newly built regional jets. The three remaining Delta Connection carriers will take on more of a focus on distinct geographical regions. SkyWest's operations will be centered in the western U.S., Republic will maintain its focus on the East Coast, and Endeavor will be responsible for much of the rest of the country. Delta customers probably won't notice much of a change from the","Aug 13, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/13/delta-retools-its-regional-network-and-more-change.aspx
4,How the Trade War is Stifling Capex and Margins,"How the Trade War is Stifling Capex and Margins. . Significance For Investors. Looking Ahead. Compete Risk Free with $100,000","The U.S.-China trade war is becoming an increasing matter of concern for S&P 500 companies, judging by 2Q 2019 earnings calls. An increasing number are mentioning China growth trends in their calls, with almost half these mentions being negative, up from less than 30% being negative in 1Q 2019, Bank of America reports. Additionally, about 15% of the companies reporting so far have mentioned negative impacts from tariffs, compared to about 10% in the first quarter. Moreover, during the first half of 2019, corporate capital expenditures (capex) have been growing at the lowest rate in the last two years. ""With no trade truce in sight and macro data (particularly in manufacturing/industrials) continuing to surprise to the downside, the uncertainty overhang may continue to impact business spending,"" BofA writes. Excluding the financial sector, the average net profit margin for the S&P 500 is coming in at 10.9% for 2Q 2019, down by 60 basis points from the same period in 2018, BofA reports. So far, about 90% of the S&P 500 companies have issued 2Q 2019 earnings reports. Margin compression has been most pronounced in sectors that have the most exposure to trade or which are the most labor intensive, including materials, information technology, industrials, and consumer discretionary, BofA adds. Regarding capital expenditures, 2Q 2019 results are showing year-over-year (YOY) growth of about 3%, roughly in line with the 1Q 2019 YOY growth rate, the lowest since 2Q 2017, per BofA. Based on their analysis of corporate guidance on capex, BofA sees trade-related uncertainties continuing to restrain spending plans. There has been an increase of 41% in the number of S&P 500 companies mentioning tariffs in their earnings calls, FactSet Research Systems reports. Their study compared the 419 first quarter 2019 earnings calls that occurred between March 15 and May 8 with the 438 second quarter 2019 earnings calls that took place between June 15 and Aug. 8. During these periods, the number of companies discussing tariffs rose from 88 (21% of 419) in 1Q calls to 124 (28% of 438) in 2Q calls. In the 2Q 2019 calls analyzed by FactSet, companies in the industrials sector have discussed tariffs the most, accounting for 35 of the 124 mentions. The information technology sector has seen the biggest increase in the number of tariff mentions from 1Q to 2Q, up by 11 companies.

You can tap into a number of different options, including online travel platforms like TripAdvisor TRIP 0.90%

, which was one of the first travel guide and research websites.      Contents TripAdvisor was founded in 2000 by a group led by Stephen Kaufer. The company had the bright idea of putting a button on its travel website that said, “Visitors add your own review,” which became the basis for the platform’s current model. Users now share their reviews and ratings on destinations, attractions and places to stay via the TripAdvisor platform, which also provides web portals to facilitate bookings.  In 2004, the company was bought by IAC/InterActiveCorp, which spun off the travel group business under the Expedia name in 2005. Expedia spun off TripAdvisor in December of 2011 through an initial public offering (IPO).  Immediately before the second spin-off, Expedia implemented a 1-for-2 reverse stock split, which means that for every 2 shares of Expedia, stockholders would effectively only own 1 share. The next day, Expedia shareholders were entitled to 1 share of Expedia and 1 share of TripAdvisor common stock for every share of Expedia owned. According to the company’s own internal log files for the 3rd quarter of 2018, TripAdvisor is the world’s largest travel platform. Over 490 million travelers consult the website every month. The platform provides travelers with information on 8.3 million travel-related establishments that include accommodations, airlines, cruises, restaurants and other unique travel experiences. TripAdvisor encourages users to leave a review and gives them access to browse more than 760 million reviews and opinions of other users. The service is available in 49 markets and has been translated into 28 languages.  TripAdvisor is not a tour operator or booking agent and the platform does not charge any service fees to users of its website. The company instead relies on payments from airlines and other travel partners that offer services through the platform. TripAdvisor’s affiliates and subsidiaries also own and operate their own portfolio of 25 travel brands that can be accessed through the TripAdvisor platform.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders? Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for American Airlines Group As you can see below, American Airlines Group had US$24.6b of debt, at June 2019, which is about the same the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. On the flip side, it has US$5.41b in cash leading to net debt of about US$19.2b. We can see from the most recent balance sheet that American Airlines Group had liabilities of US$20.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$41.9b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$5.41b in cash and US$1.94b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$54.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined. The deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$12.3b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt After all, American Airlines Group would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.       Sometimes, following a leader makes the best investment strategy. And","Aug 13, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-american-airlines-group-nasdaq-145421063.html

Cathay Pacific plunges to decade lows after China retaliates against its protesting employees (CPCAY). SHARE THIS POST. Your Market,"   Cathay Pacific Airways  Cathay Pacific plummeted to decade lows after China demanded that it prevent protesting employees from flying to the mainland. Shares of Hong Kong's dominant airline traded down 4.9% Monday, closing at their lowest price since June 2009. China's civil aviation agency sent its demands after trading hours ended Friday, calling on Cathay to share information for crew members flying to China and bar protesting employees from flying to the mainland. The move comes after more than two months of protests in Hong Kong against the Chinese government. The outcry originally targeted a bill that would allow China to extradite Hong Kong citizens to the mainland for trial, but quickly grew into a call for autonomous democracy. Hong Kong operates within a ""One Country, Two Systems"" structure with China, but the tension between the duo is escalating quickly as Hong Kong citizens fight for the city's independence.  Beijing's request forced Cathay to pick between its workforce and a critical market. Half of the company's revenue comes from flights leaving from either mainland China or Hong Kong, Bloomberg reported. Cathay responded to the demands by suspending a pilot who was detained for his participation in a protest and firing two workers for ""misconduct,"" according to Bloomberg. Employees who ""support or participate in illegal protests"" would face action that ""may include termination of employment,"" Cathay Pacific CEO Rupert Hogg warned in a Monday note to staff. Markets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors. If you're active in the markets, CLICK HERE to sign up. The airline's actions ""have led to a severe threat to aviation safety, created negative social impact and increased the risk of flying from Hong Kong to the mainland,"" the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement given to Bloomberg. Authorities at the Hong Kong International Airport canceled all flights to and from the city Monday after protesters filled the airport for the fourth consecutive day. Thousands of people occupied the building as protests against mainland China's government and Hong Kong's police force raged on.  ""Airport operations at Hong Kong International Airport have been seriously disrupted as a result of the public assembly at the airport today,"" authorities said in a statement sent to Business Insider.

Joe Randell noted Tuesday that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., which bought the floundering regional jet program from Bombardier in June, scooped up the maintenance and marketing activities for the CRJ -- though not its manufacturing operations -- as part of the $550-million deal. ""It's fully supported by Mitsubishi, and I think that will be the case for decades in the future,"" Randell said on a conference call with investors. Chorus, which leases planes across the globe and provides regional service for Air Canada, signed an agreement in February for nine more CRJs to bolster a total leasing fleet that currently sits at 40 planes. The nine regional jets will join the five CRJs already under lease to Air Canada via Chorus subsidiary Jazz Aviation LP, which inked a deal earlier this year to continue to provide Canada's biggest airline with regional service through to 2035.

But what if we told you that two of the top performers in the Dow Jones index year-to-date aren’t technology at all but instead American Express and Visa, which are dividend stocks that have gained more than 30 percent each year-to-date. Not to be outdone, Microsoft and Apple are also up roughly the same so far this year. To be fair, both financials and technology stocks are getting hit pretty hard in the trade-war fueled stock market downturn, but not all of the gains have been erased. In fact, the Dow Jones remains only about 5 percent from its peak, which isn’t too shabby considering the talk about an economic recession. If things continue to worsen, the bottom could still fall out.

Meanwhile, the gold price is looking bullish and is currently trading above $1,500 per ounce. For some reason, investors flocked to the precious metal instead of digital gold, at least today, as fears of a recession, either in the short-term or long-term, loom. Crypto trader Brian Kelly on CNBC said that “macro buyers are using bitcoin as a currency hedge” but adds that BTC wallet address growth, which reflects user adoption, isn’t where it needs to be. For months, bitcoin has been looking like a safe-haven asset in this uncertain global economy. Trader Peter Tchir points out in Forbes that the BTC price has been “[moving] more or less in lines with the headlines.” As a safe-haven asset should, the price has ebbed and flowed in tandem with the tone of trade talks between the U.S. and China. Not today. If you’re wondering why you’re not alone. Tchir  suggested on Twitter that it could have something to do with the “new China crypto chatter.” Bloomberg Crypto reports that “China’s central bank says its own cryptocurrency is ‘close’ to release.'”  China’s move toward a digital currency is seemingly defensive in nature, with tech companies such as Facebook now plotting to create their own coins that would threaten the status of fiat money.

14,Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Warns Airline Staff They Could Be Fired for Supporting Protests - WSJ,The Wall Street Journal. Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Warns Airline Staff They Could Be Fired for Supporting Protests. Threat to,"Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. threatened to fire staff involved in unauthorized protests against the city’s government, as the airline raced to placate Beijing and avert a boycott from its mainland Chinese customers. The move underlined the delicate position in which Hong Kong’s deepening political crisis has placed the city’s flag carrier, which must also avoid alienating its local customer base and much of its own workforce, some of whom say they fear a purge of staff implicated for their involvement in the protests. The threat came as Hong Kong’s airport authority canceled more than 100 flights Monday afternoon after thousands of demonstrators thronged the main terminal to protest police for their handling of this summer’s long-running protests—dealing another blow to the carrier. Shares of Cathay Pacific fell 4.9% Monday, the worst drop in three years. The Hong Kong-listed stock has now lost a fifth of its value since mid-July and closed at its lowest level in more than a decade. In an email sent to staff Monday after another weekend of violent protests across the city—most of which weren’t authorized by the police—Rupert Hogg, Cathay Pacific’s chief executive, said the carrier had “a zero tolerance approach to illegal activities.” He added that “there will be disciplinary consequences for employees who support or participate in illegal protests.
