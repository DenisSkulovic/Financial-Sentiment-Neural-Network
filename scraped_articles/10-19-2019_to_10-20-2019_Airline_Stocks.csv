Credit where due.,"Wall Street’s final act of 2019 will hinge on whether investors should believe the messages being sent by corporate credit, crowd consensus and the calendar characteristics. The broad market has been a sloppy stalemate between supportive and antagonistic forces for many months: The S&P 500 is hovering around the 3000 level it first reached in July – and is only up 4 percent from its January 2018 peak. The global economic slowdown and flattening of corporate profits have held equities in check — leading to bouts of intense recession anticipation — while profoundly low global bond yields and a still-sturdy U.S. consumer have bolstered stock valuations. Now — with the S&P up nearly 20% year to date but with the near-20% drop of a year ago fresh in mind — most investors, Cassandras and Polyannas alike, agree on a few things. Stocks are not cheap at close to 17-times forecast earnings, but also not terribly expensive, especially compared to bond yields. The Federal Reserve has cut rates twice and is quite likely to offer a third, even without severe weakness striking the U.S. economy. And while the economic expansion is looking mature, there aren’t bright flashing lights indicating an imminent recession.  This leads to those three crucial factors under debate as the key to whether the market is preparing to break higher after a long bull-market intermission or not. If a recession were ominously approaching, it would come as something of a surprise to the corporate-debt markets, which have a reputation for expressing worry about the economy and risks to company cash flows before stocks register them. For now, the credit backdrop remains pretty benign, helped by an easier Fed and a global hunger for predictable cash yield. The risk spread demanded by investors in the vast market for BBB-rated corporate debt has been steady, as seen here. Certainly this gap has widened from very tight readings back in 2018 but are not signaling stress or alarm about the availability of money for lower-rated issuers in the investment-grade universe.  Source: FRED Citigroup strategists also point to the Fed’s bank survey showing that lending standards for commercial and industrial loans have not become particularly restrictive, which in their view hints that industrial production should reverse some of its recent drop.

1,– Trader Makes 14000% Gain In Two Simple Trades & Reveals Secret Technique,Trader Makes 14000% Gain In Two Simple Trades & Reveals Secret Technique. 19% fall in stock price results in 6500%,"  Eddie Choi, a punter who hangs out at a reddit forum named wallstreetbets with the user name TheTriviaTribe, has raked in a massive fortune by buying put options of a company named ‘Roku‘. Roku, a company listed on NASDAQ, is notorious for wild fluctuations in its stock price. It is common for its stock price to surge and plunge a few percentage points in the course of a day.  Eddie Choi exploited this characteristic of the stock to his advantage. He bought a truckload of Put Options of Roku by investing a sum of $766 (Rs. 57,000). Because the puts were “Out of Money” and expiry was just a few days later, the options were available at a throwaway price. To Eddie’s good luck, Roku slumped 19% on 20th September. This slump caused the value of the put options to balloon. Eddie’s puts were now worth $50,553 (Rs. 35.89 lakh), translating into a mind-boggling gain of 6,500% overnight. A guy on Reddit turned $766 into $107,758 on *two* options trades https://t.co/zHWk0W7jhC — Bloomberg (@business) October 19, 2019  Eddie proved that his success with Roku in not a flash-in-the-pan. He invested the proceeds in buying Puts in the S&P 500 ETF of the strike price $297. When the ETF slipped from $297 to $295.87 on 24th September, the Puts doubled in value. “I’m naturally a risk-loving person,” Eddie admitted candidly. Eddie was grilled by his followers as to how he achieved the enormous success and to reveal the secret formula. He was quite humble and credited his success to “luck“. “You could be the best trader in the world, but a win like this involves a lot of luck,” he said. “Long term trading involves a lot less luck than short term trading,” he added. He also explained that he bought options expiring the next day that were almost worthless when he bought it, and the price dropped 20%. “It doesn’t mean that I didn’t have a reason for buying it, but there’s a lot of luck involved with it,” he said. He also advised his followers not to be defiant about being a “Bull” or a “Bear” but to flow with the trend. “I’m not bull or bear. I follow the overall market and some stocks, and decide if I’ll be bear or bull for the next day to week for the overall market or a","Oct 19, 2019",https://rakesh-jhunjhunwala.in/punter-makes-14000-gain-in-two-simple-trades-reveals-secret-technique/

Last Updated at October 19, 2019 02:52 IST Indian carriers will operate 23,403 domestic flights per week during the winter schedule starting October 27, with IndiGo set to operate 10,310 flights, according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The winter schedule will be in effect from October 27 to March 28 next year. The number of weekly flights in the upcoming winter schedule is 1.2 per cent higher than the 23,117 operated during the previous winter schedule. According to an industry estimate, scheduled carriers in India will add at least 30 aircraft till December, of which 20 will be added by the first week of November. The Tata-SIA joint venture Vistara is restarting its capacity induction programme following a lull. The airline, which expanded an average of five aircraft per year, is adding five planes this month itself. By December, it will add five more, taking its total fleet size to 41. The new acquisitions will consist of one Boeing 737 and nine Airbus 320neos. That airlines are desperate to boost capacity. This can be gauged from Ajay Singh-led SpiceJet, which is wet leasing five Boeing 737 from Turkish airline Corendon. The airline’s new capacity induction has almost stagnated as it still awaits to resume operations of Boeing 737 Max, which was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes. A senior DGCA official said 23,403 departures per week have been finalised, covering 103 airports. There would be more flights with the addition/acquisition of aircraft by the operators during the winter schedule. Out of the 103 airports, a scheduled domestic airline has proposed to operate to/ from Pithoragarh (Uttarakhand) and Hindon airport (UP)) as new stations, the official said. National carrier Air India will operate 2,254 weekly flights during the latest winter schedule, an increase of 17.6 per cent compared to the year-ago period. SpiceJet will operate 4,316 weekly flights, a rise of 46 per cent, while IndiGo would fly 10,310 flights every week during the winter schedule.

3,"Jet Airways effect! Vistara, Spicejet to record sharp rise in weekly departures - The Financial Express","Jet Airways effect! Vistara, Spicejet to record sharp rise in weekly departures. India's largest airline by domestic market share, IndiGo,","Vistara and SpiceJet have been the biggest gainers in terms of airline slot re-distributions post the grounding of Jet Airways. Weekly domestic departures in the winter schedule of 2019 are set to grow by a tepid 1.2%, compared with the corresponding period last year. Weekly domestic departures for Vistara during the winter schedule for 2019 would rise 64% to 1,376 from 838 a year ago, data sourced from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) showed. SpiceJet’s weekly departures during the winter schedule will go up 46% to 4316, from 2957 a year ago. Flights are divided into two scheduling seasons. The summer schedule runs from last Sunday of March until the last Saturday of October, the remainder comes under the winter schedule. India’s largest airline by domestic market share, IndiGo, which last winter had 9,030 weekly departures, will now have 10,310 weekly flights between October 27 and March 28. Meanwhile, there will be 2,254 weekly departures of Air India flights under the winter schedule for 2019, up 17.6% from the corresponding period a year ago. Even with Jet’s grounding, there are 23,403 departures per week that have been scheduled covering 103 airports, a DGCA note stated. The schedule will add more flights with the expected acquisition of aircraft by domestic carriers. “Prompt steps by the government has filled the void created by Jet Airways and has helped to achieve a growth of 1.2% compared to winter schedule 2018,” the note stated. However, among the airlines which hold 99.5% of the domestic market share, weekly departures will reduce to 20,553 in 2019, compared with 21,348 weekly flights a year ago. Last year, during the winter schedule, Jet Airways was flying nearly 3,600 flights weekly. After the grounding of the airline on 17 April, Jet’s slots were reallocated to other domestic carriers and will continue to be with them till March. A senior DGCA official said the Synergy Group, the only entity interested in the beleaguered airline, ‘seemed bullish during a meeting with government officials last month, but have not been in touch since’. FE had earlier reported that Jet’s resolution has been delayed till December. “With this delay, there is little chance of Jet being accommodated into the winter schedule for 2019. These discussions will only happen once they have a revival plan in place,” the official told FE.

It’s been more than three decades since the bottom fell out in the stock market in 1987, and one thing remains clear – the more things change, the more they stay the same. On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones index plummeted more than 22%, marking the worst single-day performance in the New York Stock Exchange’s history, including the start of the Great Depression, and earning the nickname Black Monday. These days, the global economy is suffering from what Wall Street veteran Ray Dalio describes as a “great sag.” While the stock market faces headwinds that have made volatility the new normal, it’s hard to imagine an imminent collapse, the likes of which we haven’t seen either since the eighties or the Great Recession. That doesn’t mean that people aren’t worried and there aren’t lessons to glean from the stock market crash of ’87.

Company,"If you have the right know-how, trading can be a very lucrative and profitable business. But even the most seasoned investor can benefit from saving a few dollars here and there—especially when it comes to fees and commissions. There is a huge range of service providers investors can use to get investment research and execute trades in a cost-effective and timely manner. Some information providers are free, while others are subscription-based. Websites such as Investopedia and Yahoo Finance provide investors with a vast array of free stock information such as company financial statements, key earnings ratios, and recent company news. This ""raw data,"" however, is only useful if the investor is knowledgeable in what the information is conveying. For example, knowing a company's P/E ratio is only useful if the investor understands the ratio's underlying concept. There are many variables to weigh when considering stock buys and the decision-making process can be complex. Due to the sheer volume and complexity of this raw data, subscription-based advisory and analyst services can be extremely useful because they help disseminate and analyze raw data for investors. These types of services provide market analysis as well as potential stock picks based on their analyses of a wide range of companies and industries. The most inexpensive way to purchase company shares is through a discount broker. A discount broker provides little financial advice, while the more expensive full-service broker provides comprehensive services like advice on stock selections and financial planning. If you use some of the free information sources or subscription-based analysis services in combination with the discount broker, it is possible to keep costs relatively low. The more you educate yourself about the financial world, the less you will have to rely on investment advisors or full-service brokers. The more comfortable investors are with the stock market, the greater the benefit from going with a discount broker or online broker such as Scottrade and E*Trade, where fees can be as low as $5 to $10 per trade. That's compared to full-service brokers where fees can be several hundred dollars per trade. And lower commissions means you'll have more money to invest. If you're looking for a cheap and easy way to buy stock, consider direct stock purchase plans (DSPPs). These plans let you buy stock directly from the company without the need for a broker.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   The preseason slate officially concluded on Friday, and we have just two more days before the much anticipated 209-20 campaign commences. Over the last three weeks, there have been a handful of players that improved their fantasy stock thanks to impressive performances in the preseason, while others have failed to live up to expectations. Stock up:
* Zach LaVine
Not only did Lavine average nearly a point per minute in the preseason (23.3 points per game in 24.1 mins), he was also incredibly efficient on the offensive end. He shot a scorching 59.3 percent from the floor, 56 percent from downtown (while averaging 3.5 made treys a night) and 83.3 percent from the free-throw stripe. Last season, he ranked 61st overall in nine-category fantasy formats after shooting a career-high 46.7 percent from the field. If he can boost that number up closer to 50% this year, and cut down on his turnovers, he has a great chance to crack the top-50 in 2019-20. * Kristaps Porzingis
KP's final numbers were solid (16.0 points, 9.5 rebounds, 2.0 triples, 1.5 assists, 0.5 steals, 0.5 blocks, 1.8 turnovers per game), even though he struggled with his shot, converting 39.3% of his field-goal attempts. However, the most important takeaway from his preseason was the fact that he played in four games and didn't suffer any setbacks. Remember, coming into October, it had been 610 days since Porzingis last stepped foot on an NBA court. The Mavs will err on the side of caution, and KP will likely sit out at least 15 games due to ""load management,"" but his upside remains remarkably enticing.

Tapping Into America's Best-Kept Future","WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 10: Siblings Zinet Adem, 45, of Beltsville, MD left, and Beza Alemu, 32, ... [+] Almost three years ago, a Boeing pilot encountered major problems during a simulator trial of its 737 MAX’s control software. But in the wake of 346 deaths linked to that control software, it took Boeing – in whose securities I have no financial interest – until October 17, 2019 to let the Department of Transportation – home of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) – know about that pilot’s problem with the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). This news – which an MIT professor told me October 19 he views as “scandalous” – raises a troubling question: Is Boeing’s culture systematically shielding from regulators any safety-related information that could put the brakes on its growth ambitions? In an October 18 statement, Boeing said that its former chairman and still “President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg called FAA Administrator Dickson to respond to the concerns raised in his letter. In addition, Mr. Muilenburg assured the Administrator that we are taking every step possible to safely return the MAX to service.” PROMOTED Boeing further said that earlier in 2019, it produced what it said was “a document containing statements by a former Boeing employee” to the attention of “the appropriate investigating authority.” Moreover, Boeing shared this document on October 17, 2019 with the Department of Transportation and the next day provided the document to “the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee’s investigation into the 737 MAX.” Boeing’s Bad Bet That Pilots With Airmanship Could Handle A Faulty MCAS The latest Boeing news is that Mark Forkner, then Boeing’s chief technical pilot for the 737, texted with a colleague about problems he had in a simulator run of the MCAS. As Bloomberg reported, in November 2016, Forkner “recounted a rocky MCAS simulator trial whose handling performance he dubbed ‘egregious.’” Forkner also told a colleague that MCAS was “running rampant in the [aircraft simulator tests] on me.” When I read these details, my mind jumped to a must-read September 2019 article in the New York Times Magazine, which left me thinking that Boeing’s 737 MAX design assumed that the pilots flying it were imbued with “airmanship” which the author described as “a visceral sense of navigation, an operational understanding of weather and weather information, the ability to form mental maps of traffic flows, fluency in the nuance of","Oct 19, 2019",https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/10/19/down-22-how-much-farther-will-boeings-scandalous-conduct-plunge-its-shares/
13,"Clearing House - Definition, Functions, and Importance",Clearing House. What is a Clearing House?. Example of a Clearing House. Functions of a Clearing House. Initial Margin and,"A clearing house acts as a mediator between any two entities or parties that are engaged in a financial transaction. Its main role is to ensure that the transaction goes smoothly, with the buyer receiving the tradable goods he intends to acquire and the seller receiving the right amount paid for the tradable goods he is selling.      Our Introduction to Corporate Finance Course gives you an overview of how capital markets work.   Anyone who engages in any kind of financial transaction wants to be protected in regard to the transaction. The buyer wants to be assured of receiving the goods or services they purchased, and the seller wants to be assured of receiving payment. The clearing house stands in the middle and takes both sides to make sure that both parties are satisfied. Consider an investor who wishes to sell 500 shares of his stock in Emirates Airlines to another investor. It is the clearing house’s job to make sure that the investor gets paid the proper amount for his 500 shares and that the buyer indeed receives the full amount of shares that he paid for. With a clearing house, both parties can rest assured that a successful transaction will take place. The diagram above shows the simplified flow of a transaction involving two parties, the seller and the buyer, and in between them, the clearing house firm. The clearing house is not only involved in regular transactions of tradable goods but also of those that involve futures contracts (contracts entered into by two parties wherein the buyer is obliged to buy an asset and the seller to sell an asset for an agreed-upon price on an agreed future date). Because futures contracts take time to be fulfilled, it is beneficial to have a third party (the clearing firm) to ensure that the contract is not broken. Looking again at the diagram, the seller gives the goods to the clearing house, which then gives them to the futures buyer. In turn, the futures buyer hands the payment to the clearing house who will then give it to the seller. In such an arrangement, both parties are protected and assured that they will both receive what is due to them.   As mentioned, a clearing house is basically the mediator between two transacting parties. However, there is also more to what clearing","Oct 19, 2019",https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/deals/clearing-house/
14,Alliance Air To Launch Flights In New Routes In 2 Months: CEO,. Alliance Air to launch flights in new routes in 2 months: CEO. Alliance Air CEO C S Subbiah said,"                                           Alliance Air, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Air India has chalked out aggressive expansion plans which include launch of flights to newer destinations, a top official has said. Alliance Air recently launched its maiden overseas flight from Chennai to Jaffna making it the 55th destination connected by the airline. Alliance Air CEO C S Subbiah said the airline would connect various cities including Jagdalpur, Raipur, Gulbarga and Hubli among others. ""We are look at flying to Jagdalpur, Gulbarga. These are the two new routes. The flight from Gulbarga will connect to Bengaluru and later to Chennai,"" he told PTI. Jagdalpur route would be connected from Hyderabad then later to Raipur and then it would go to Bhopal, he said. Subbiah said Alliance Air was utilising the Centre's UDAN scheme one hundred percent and added that they were ""forerunners"" operating under the scheme. UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik) scheme commenced in 2017, is a regional airport development and Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) aimed at making air travel affordable. Under the scheme, 50 percent seats in aeroplanes are offered at concessional rates to passengers. Elaborating on the proposal to launch new flights, Subbiah said, ""In 2015 we were hardly in 15 stations. Under (Air India CMD) Lohani's leadership we are now connecting 54 destinations. The 55th route was Chennai to Jaffna."" On the launch of new routes in the country, he said, there are plans to connect cities in the North-East.

15,Sustainable Aviation Fuel Finally Starting To Take Off | Business Aviation News: Aviation International News,. . . NBAA CONVENTION NEWS. Sustainable Aviation Fuel Finally Starting To Take Off. SAF A PARADIGM SHIFT. WORLDWIDE VISION.,"For years, sustainable alternative fuels have been a topic of discussion in the business aviation industry as it looks to improve its overall environmental footprint, but in 2019, those words finally turned to action. In January, the industry came together at California business aviation hub Van Nuys Airport (VNY) for “Business Jets Fuel Green: A Step Towards Sustainability.” For the first time, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was available to the business aviation community on a trial basis, with World Fuel and Avfuel supplying the four FBOs on the field with more than 14,000 gallons of blended SAF produced by California-based World Energy and Gevo, respectively. The biofuel blend was in some cases pumped directly into the FBO’s fuel farm to illustrate its absolute compatibility with the existing neat jet fuel and the FBO’s tanks and pumps, while others chose to keep it stored in a refueler and distributed on customer preference. To further demonstrate the fuel’s acceptability, several OEMs sent aircraft to provide demonstration flights to upload SAF at VNY. Gulfstream, which maintains its own supply of SAF at its Savannah, Georgia headquarters to support its demonstration fleet, dispatched a G280 to VNY, setting a city–speed pair in the process. The Savannah-to-Van Nuys sprint covered 2,243 nm in 4 hours and 49 minutes at an average speed of Mach 0.85. Flying through headwinds averaging 76 knots, the G280 demonstrated the high performance possible with SAF. “This is drop-in fuel, this is jet-A,” Charles Etter, Gulfstream’s head of environmental and regulatory affairs and technical fellow, told AIN during the cross-country mission. “It has better freeze-point qualities to it, it has more energy density to it, it’s actually a better fuel.” Likewise, Bombardier sent a Challenger 350 and Embraer a Legacy 500 for the SAF-fueled flights, which took groups of conference attendees on an hour-long tour over Southern California. Given the more than 250 turbine-powered aircraft operations at VNY in the 24 hours after the renewable fuel was delivered for the event, the entire amount was quickly consumed. At its most basic level, the use of SAF represents a paradigm shift, according to Steve Csonka, executive director of the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative (CAAFI). Instead of pumping new hydrocarbons from the ground as petroleum, SAF simply recycles the carbon that is already in the atmosphere and is extracted from plants, which use photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide to oxygen.

SINGAPORE AIRLINES: FIRST VS,"                               When flying on Singapore Airlines, is it worth paying to upgrade to First Class from Business Class on long-haul flights? In ""Accommodation"" In ""Accommodation"" In ""Accommodation"" In ""Accommodation"" In ""Accommodation"" In ""Accommodation"" In ""Accommodation"" In ""Accommodation"" In ""Accommodation"" In ""Accommodation"" The Singapore Airlines First Class cabin is exquisite. On the A380 it consists of only 6 suites, with 3 suites on each side of the aisle. That’s a downscale compared to SQ’s A380s with the old layout, which features 12 First Class suites. The aisle is framed by beautifully crafted walls, only interrupted by the sliding doors which gives access to the individual suites. The exclusivity of the First Class cabin is further accentuated by two stylishly furnished lavatories in the front, one of which features palatial dimensions has a sit-down vanity counter and is stocked with Lalique toiletries (e.g. special citrus-scented facial mist, body lotion, and fragrance). The design of the new First Class cabin was inspired by the Etihad Airways’ First Class Apartments and is really special. In Business Class, the cabin on the A350 is designed by James Parker Associated, the company that also created the opulent interiors of the Orient Express and is a mix of bronzy gold, beige, purple, and chocolate-brown, colors with plush throw pillows that contrast with the dark leather seats. It is also a pretty special cabin. Singapore Airlines offers a relatively consistent cabin and Business Class product across most of its long-haul fleet. While Singapore Airlines has a prestigious reputation, offering great service, delicious food, excellent in-flight entertainment, and the always smiling Singapore air hostess.

17,Better Buy: Boeing vs. Airbus | The Motley Fool,Better Buy: Boeing vs. Airbus. Let's compare the risk and reward profiles of these two aviation giants.. SWOT analysis of,"   These two perennial aviation rivals will always be compared in terms of aircraft orders and production schedules, but which of the two is the better investment right now? Let's take a look at the risk and reward calculations that you have to make before deciding on buying stock in Boeing or Airbus. The themes discussed throughout are outlined in the strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) table below. It should come as no surprise that the return to service of the Boeing 737 MAX looms large in looking at the prospects for Boeing, but other key issues differentiate the two companies -- namely operational performance (Boeing is better) and the potential for a pickup in wide-body demand in the near future (Boeing looks better placed). For reference, Boeing is also a leading defense stock, but let's focus on commercial aviation, as that's where both companies make the majority of their profit. Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat Boeing (NYSE:BA) Track record of successful production ramp-ups 737 MAX debacle has damaged confidence in the company Aggressive plans to increase up margin, growth opportunity from Boeing Global Services, and wide-body order growth 737 MAX won't return to service as planned; wide-body market won't pick up as planned Airbus (OTC:EADSY) Leadership in narrow-body aircraft Patchy margin and cash flow performance; A380 and A330 have been disappointments in terms of sales Can benefit from the 737 MAX debacle, also improve operational performance Failure to ramp up production and meet targets DATA SOURCE: AUTHOR'S ANALYSIS. It goes without saying that the risk of a failure to return the 737 MAX to service in timely fashion hangs over Boeing stock right now. CEO Dennis Muilenburg believes the return to service (RTS) will occur in October but also acknowledges that the RTS could end up being phased with, say, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration acting before the European Aviation Safety Administration does. All of this is highly significant, because aside from the obvious cash flow issues and reputational damage a delay would cause, a later-than-planned RTS will impact Boeing operationally. For example, Muilenburg has previously discussed the prospect that Boeing could temporarily halt 737 production if the RTS doesn't occur in due course. IMAGE SOURCE: BOEING WEBSITE. However, if the RTS occurs in October, Boeing plans to boost 737 production to 57 a month next year from 42 a month at present.
