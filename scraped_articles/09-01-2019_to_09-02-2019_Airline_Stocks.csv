1,'Fear bubble' is creating a huge buying opportunity: long-time bull,"A ‘fear bubble’ is creating a huge buying opportunity, long-time market bull Jim Paulsen says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News","A bad August for the markets may usher in an even worst September based on seasonal trends. But long-time bull Jim Paulsen is positioning for a breakout by year’s end because he believes dread is oversaturating the market. “We almost have a fear bubble. That’s our primary thing that sits out there for me,” the Leuthold Group’s chief investment strategist told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “People are not loading into stocks even though we’re really close to market highs. They’re loading into bonds even though they have close to record low yields... The behavior just screams fear.” August marked the market’s second losing month of the year. The Dow and S&P 500 were off almost 2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by about 3%. In July, stocks were hitting all-time highs. Paulsen, who correctly predicted the stock market would sharply rebound from last December’s historic pullback, expects evidence of a stronger economy will calm fears. “I think the odds favor all of the policy stimulus we’ve introduced: fiscal stimulus, policy stimulus, monetary growth, lower yields,” he added. “It’s been about six to nine months lag time, and I think it’s going to start to improve economic reports.” According to Paulsen, that’ll be what ultimately paves the way to new record highs. “If you pierce a fear bubble, do you have a big rally? And, I kind of think that’s one of the contributing factors to the upside,” said Paulsen. “If we find out it turns out better than feared, many, many portfolios are under allocated to risk assets and will have to re-adjust themselves trying to get more risk which could drive risk assets a lot higher.” Yet, he acknowledges the market is in a late-stage economic growth cycle. However, he isn’t going into recession countdown mode like many of his Wall Street peers. “We’ve grown slowly close to the 2% stall speed we used to worry about the entire recovery. We’re at full employment with 4% unemployment,” Paulsen said. “We’re in the longest recovery ever now in U.S. history. So there are certainly characteristics of being near the end. But character wise, I just don’t see the overextended nature mainly because we’ve been so conservative.” Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

AirBaltic CEO Martin Gauss said in Jul-2019 that 2021 or 2022 could be a suitable time for an IPO, provided the airline is meeting targets. He is right not to rush this urge for a stock market flotation. The Riga-based hybrid LCC has achieved a strong return to growth since 2016 after years of stagnation and losses. Moreover, it has achieved positive net profits for six years running and is now partway through a transition towards a fleet wholly consisting of the Airbus A220-300, for which it was the launch customer in 2016. However, its net margins are low and its operating profit record is more patchy. Furthermore, airline industry margins appear past their cyclical peak and over the past two years most European airline share prices have fallen. The European airline landscape has for some time been dividing into two broad categories: those with strategic and financial strength and those that struggle to generate sustainable profitability. A downturn will test all airlines, but those in the stronger category will be better placed to meet this test than in the past. AirBaltic has the potential to join this group, but continued patience before launching an IPO is sensible. Our Analysis Reports are only available to CAPA Members.

(NASDAQ:UAL) Suggests It's 36% Undervalued. Crunching the numbers. 10-year free cash flow","How far off is United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. I will be using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: (""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)= $17.5b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the intial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 10-year government bond rate of 2.7%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10.8%.

Leave"," WOODFORD OUTFLOWS Embattled fund manager spends £145 million of cash raised from sale of smaller companies on blue-chip stocks in bid to reposition suspended fund. Neil Woodford has spent £145 million on shares in British American Tobacco (BATS), BT (BT) and British Airways owner International Airlines Group (ICAG) as the embattled fund manager seeks to reposition his flagship Woodford Equity Income fund and secure the lifting of its suspension. Woodford has pledged to reposition the fund as a 'much more liquid portfolio' before a targeted reopening in early December, by selling down hard-to-trade smaller companies and unquoted stocks.  The fund manager has raised around £900 million in share sales since the suspension across his three funds, with the bulk of that coming from Woodford Equity Income, and has invested around 80% of the proceeds in his flagship fund into FTSE 100 stocks. The new purchases are disclosed in Woodford Equity Income's interim report, covering the six months to the end of June and showing the manager's activity in the first few weeks since dealing in the fund was suspended. They mark a significant departure for Woodford, who at the time of his last full portfolio disclosure for the fund at the end of April held only three FTSE 100 stocks: house builders Barratt Developments (BDEV) and Taylor Wimpey (TW) and tobacco company Imperial Brands (IMB). His fund had instead featured heavy holdings in hard-to-trade stocks listed on the junior Alternative Investment Market and unquoted companies. This contributed to the manager's difficulty in funding withdrawals as investors fled amid poor performance and culminated in the fund's suspension in June.  A Woodford spokesman said: 'Neil continues to reposition the portfolio into more liquid FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies, but still reflecting the same investment strategy. 'This strategy is founded on a belief that the global economic environment is not as robust as equity markets are implying.' Woodford's £39 million acquisition of shares in British American Tobacco, a 1.1% position in the fund, rekindles the manager's relationship with a stock he has held throughout the bulk of his 30-year career as a fund manager. The stock was a perennial feature of the Invesco Income and High Income fund he ran and was the third largest holding when he launched Woodford Equity Income five years ago.

The coach of Angola's national team at this World Cup speaks no fewer than six languages and doesn't regularly get his mail because he's hardly ever near Idaho - the place he currently calls home. He grew up in Vermont, went to college in California, worked for a couple NBA staffs, ran teams in the ABA and G League, and has coached in places like Norway, Nigeria and China. Oh, and he used to live in Gregg Popovich's house. ''I've kind of embraced the journey of it all,'' Voigt said. He's not the only coach whose trip to the World Cup classifies as a journey. Voigt is one of five Americans serving as head coaches in the tournament - others include Poland's Mike Taylor, Jordan's Joseph Stiebing, Canada's Nick Nurse and Popovich. ''Nick is honorary Canadian,'' Rowan Barrett, the general manager of Canada Basketball, said of the NBA champion Toronto Raptors' coach. In all, 11 men from one nation are coaching another at this World Cup: There's Taylor, Stiebing, Nurse and Voigt, plus Italy's Paolo Povia (coaching Ivory Coast) and Sergio Scariolo (Spain), Argentina's Fernando Duro (Venezuela) and Julio Lamas (Japan), Portugal's Mario Palma (Tunisia), Israel's Ronen Ginzburg (Czech Republic) and Croatia's Aleksandar Petrovic (Brazil). Taylor's first foreign coaching job was in Germany in 2001. ''Hey, I thought I'll come over for one year,'' said Taylor, a Florida resident who has also worked in the Czech Republic and now Poland. ''I came over and basically have been over here ever since.'' This is not a new phenomenon, someone from one nation coaching a team from another. But Voigt's story stands out. Cabot, Vermont, population about 1,500, is known for cheese - not coaches. The Cabot Creamery puts out some of the best cheddar in the world.

The tennis event at the Olympics will begin two weeks after Wimbledon and Federer said it is simply too soon to decide if he will chase a singles gold medal, which is the only major prize the 20-times Grand Slam champion has yet to win. ""I don't know if I'm going to be playing there just because it's still a year away,"" Federer said after beating David Goffin to reach the U.S. Open quarter-finals. ""Even though the time is slowly coming around for me, in my mind, my team, my family, to find out what's the best schedule after Wimbledon next year."" The Swiss 38-year-old competed in the first of four Olympic Games at Sydney in 2000 and won doubles gold in 2008 and silver in singles in 2012. ""Needless to say, the Olympics, the ones I played, have always been very memorable, either with carrying the flag, meeting my wife in 2000, winning gold, winning silver,"" said Federer. ""Naturally it's always going to be a possibility for me to play Tokyo if there is an exemption.

9,Amazon.com Buys Into Another Cargo Plane Company | The Motley Fool,Amazon.com Buys Into Another Cargo Plane Company. This time it's the leading Canadian air freight carrier.. Online sales growth up,"     Just beginning to flex its muscles in the logistics and transportation industry in the U.S., Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now making a big move up north by acquiring a minority stake in Canadian freight cargo carrier Cargojet (OTC:CGJT.F). Amazon already uses Cargojet's aircraft services for mid-mile delivery from Amazon warehouses to distribution centers, but the deal that sees the e-commerce giant take a 9.9% stake in the carrier has been structured to encourage it to use Cargojet's network even more, giving Amazon the ability to claim new ground in a different market. IMAGE SOURCE: AMAZON.COM.  E-commerce growth is surging globally, and Amazon recently introduced one-day delivery in both the U.S. and Canada. Carriers like UPS and FedEx now deliver seven days a week, but the latter has severed most of its ties to Amazon to make itself available to other large customers expanding their e-commerce presence. Where promises for two-day delivery could largely be handled by truck, the guarantees for speedier shipping necessitate the use of more air cargo capacity. Walmart and Target have been notable Amazon rivals that are successfully meeting the demand for faster delivery times, and while in-store pickup for online orders is a preferred method for same-day fulfillment, the need to get packages from warehouse to customer means air freight capacity is going to be a premium service. Like in the U.S., Amazon is the primary online shopping destination for Canadian consumers. A survey of the e-commerce market by the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) says 85% of Canadian consumers have made a purchase on Amazon compared to just 32% at runner-up Walmart. Amazon has quadrupled its same-day or one-day delivery reach within the country since 2015. Earlier this year, Amazon added 13 additional cities in Canada eligible for one-day Prime delivery. Cargojet already completely owns the air freight market with a 95% share of the domestic overnight cargo business. While the carrier doesn't break out its e-commerce business separately, RBC says the segment was wholly responsible for Cargojet's rising total volumes over the past three years, which grew 7% in 2016 and 14% over the last two years, and there's more room to grow. Cargojet had 100% on-time delivery rates during Amazon's 48-hour Prime Day event this year as it handled over 1 million pounds more than it does during a typical week while operating 23 additional flights.

10,Why Is Cineplex (TSX:CGX) Stock a Sell Despite Falling 30% Since November? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why Is Cineplex (TSX:CGX) Stock a Sell Despite Falling 30% Since November?.,"      Aditya Raghunath | September 2, 2019 | More on: CGX Shares of Cineplex Inc. (TSX:CGX) have fallen over 30% since November 2018. The stock is trading at $24.8 — 9.5% above its 52-week low and 30% below its 52-week high. Cineplex stock has fallen 25% in the last 12-months. It has grossly underperformed the broader markets in the last five years and has slumped over 40% since August 2014. So, is the stock a “buy” at the current price? Have Cineplex shares bottomed out and trading at an attractive valuation? Let’s look at the company’s financial metrics. Analysts expect Cineplex to grow sales by 4.5% to $1.69 billion in 2019 and 4.1% to $1.76 billion in 2020. Its earnings per share are estimated to fall by 38.5% in 2019 and then rise by 30.7% in 2020. However, analysts have forecast Cineplex earnings to fall at an annual rate of 13.1% over the next five years. Comparatively, Cineplex stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 24.9, indicating that the stock is overvalued. Analysts, however, remain optimistic about Cineplex and have a 12-month price target of $30.94 for the stock. The target price is 27% higher than the current trading price. Investors are worried about the gradual decline in theatre attendance. The cord-cutting phenomenon rising popularity of online streaming services are driving cinema footfalls lower. Cineplex is seeking to diversify revenue streams from its Rec Room business and other entertainment offerings instead of banking on just Hollywood movies for growth. Cineplex and other theatre outlets rake in money when a highly anticipated movie is released. But popular movies such as Avengers: End Game and Captain Marvel are not released throughout the year, making this a somewhat cyclical company as well. However, Cineplex management continues to have a positive outlook and have bought back company shares in the last three months. Will they be able to turnaround Cineplex’s fortunes? The movie industry continues to remain popular and forms an integral part of the domestic populace. Cineplex has a dividend yield of close to 8% — a yield that’s more than doubled in recent years driven by the company’s massive fall in its share price. The dividend payout stands at over 100% and Cineplex is unlikely to increase dividends in the near future. Cineplex’s high debt balance of $2 billion might concern investors given that it’s","Sep 2, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/09/02/why-is-cineplex-tsxcgx-stock-a-sell-despite-falling-30-since-november/

Twitter (TWTR) is one of those stocks that has been flying under the radar over the last two years. Unlike other tech giants that have been hogging media attention, Twitter has been quietly making gains. The social media firm’s net income grew from -$108,063 million in 2017 to $1.206 billion in 2018. In addition, the company is following through its strong performance after surpassing earnings estimates in both the first quarter and second quarter of 2019. As a result of growing fundamentals, the equity is up by over 50 percent year-to-date. A look at the technicals show that Twitter is just warming up. Not long after its IPO in November 2013, Twitter descended into bear territory. The stock plunged while its peers such as Facebook (FB) went into a steady uptrend. In May 2016, TWTR posted an all-time low of $13.73. That’s a massive devaluation of over 81 percent from the top of $74.73. Nevertheless, the worst appears to be behind the stock. For the first time since its IPO, the equity has made a bullish breakout to technically conclude its five-year bear market. A quick look at the weekly chart reveals that TWTR took out the diagonal resistance of $40. This triggered the breakout from a massive inverse head-and-shoulders reversal pattern. The breakout marks the beginning of the stock’s technical uptrend. Based on the height of the pattern, the immediate target of the breakout is $65.

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) futures trickled lower on Monday, extending the August stock market massacre which saw 2 percent wiped off the Dow. The early September slide came after Trump’s new wave of China tariffs went into effect on Sunday. China immediately retaliated with fresh tariffs of their own.  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) futures fell 80 points before recovering slightly on Monday. The move was accompanied by low volumes as traders take a break for Labor Day. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq Composite futures were similarly muted. On Sunday, Trump imposed a new 15 percent tariff on $110 billion of Chinese goods.

14,"Jet shutdown effect: Traffic growth lowest in 5 years, more trouble for airlines - The Financial Express","Jet shutdown effect: Traffic growth lowest in 5 years, more trouble for airlines. Expands at just 1.9% year-on-year in the","Domestic air traffic growth in FY20 so far has been the slowest in the past five years. The passenger traffic, which witnessed high double-digit growth since 2014-15, has expanded at just 1.9% year-on-year in the first four months of FY20, largely due to closure of Jet Airways. As per analysts this muted growth is expected to continue till at least January next year. “The low traffic growth in July 2019 is largely on account of lower capacity as Jet remains grounded. Additionally, full ramp-up of sales of Jet tickets, which moved to SpiceJet fleet, will take some time,” analysts at ICICI securities noted.  Aviation consultancy firm CAPA India has projected less than 5% y-o-y growth for the domestic market in FY20. However, airlines executives expect traffic growth to increase during the festival season. “July-September is a weak quarter for airlines. The July growth was mainly due to less capacity and fares being higher,” said an executive at a low-cost carrier. Watch Video: How To File ITR-1 for AY 2019-20 in less than 15 minutes  Jet commanded 15% of the domestic market share before the full-service carrier shut down due to liquidity crunch on April 17. Since then, SpiceJet and Vistara have inducted more than 40 aircraft which were earlier operated by Jet. The average domestic fares in FY20 are up 8% y-o-y, according to travel booking portal Cleartrip.  Travel industry executives point out that airlines have added more capacities, measured in terms of available seat kilometres (ASKs) on the international routes, which face less competition as compared to domestic sectors. “The passenger traffic growth requires steady increase in capacities by airlines. The traffic was increasing by 19% in 2018 when overall capacities grew at 21%. In this current financial year, the capacity has grown by only 3% y-o-y.

While international capacities at IndiGo grew at 90% y-o-y, SpiceJet is adding overseas ASKs at 80%, followed by Go Air, the DGCA data stated. Indiver Rastogi, president and group head, global business travel, Thomas Cook, however, is positive, saying the airlines have lapped up slots on key domestic routes. “We are seeing robust growth in our bookings.

15,Hindon Airport in Delhi-NCR to begin commercial operations from Oct; fly at affordable fares to these cities - The Financial Express,Hindon Airport in Delhi-NCR to begin commercial operations from Oct; fly at affordable fares to these cities. Hindon Airport: Flyers,"Hindon airport (VIDX) in Ghaziabad is likely to begin commercial flight operations from October! Flyers from Noida, Ghaziabad, and East Delhi may finally get to board flights from the newly-inaugurated Hindon airport in the first half of October. This comes after the Ministry of Defence has given its nod, an Airports Authority of India (AAI) official was quoted saying by PTI. Financial Express Online had earlier reported that there have been delays in commencement of domestic commerical flight operations at the airport. Once the operations begin, flyers will be able to travel to tier-3 cities across India such as Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand, Nasik in Maharashtra, Hubli in Karnataka, Kannur in Kerala, Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh, Kalaburgi (Gulbarga) in Karnataka, Jamnagar in Gujarat, and Shimla in Himachal Pradesh. Earlier, several airlines like Heritage Aviation, Ghodawat Airlines, IndiGo Airlines, and TurboAirlines bagged routes connecting from Hindon. Flyers will be able to book flight tickets at affordable rates for tier-2 and tier-3 cities as airlines need to cap flight ticket prices at Rs 2,500 per hour of flight under norms laid down by the RCS-UDAN scheme. The AAI official said that there have been issues related to slots that needed to be sorted out between the Indian Air Force and airline companies. He claimed it was expected that these issues would be resolved soon and the flight operations will begin from the first half of October, 2019 from Hindon airport. Two airlines have got the nod to operate from Hindon airport. The Ministry of Defence has given green light to the proposal of Ghodawat Enterprises and Delhi-based Heritage Aviation to operate flights from the Hindon airport, the AAI official said. Earlier this year, on March 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the new civil enclave at Hindon airport. Commercial flights would be operated under the operation of RCS (regional air connectivity) scheme.

Please see our DEALER LOCATOR for a list of authorized dealers which may have stock available for immediate shipment. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Regular price
$315 If you are someone that has always wanted to have the performance and versatility of an HPA system but just couldn't bear the thought of being tethered to an airline or having a tank screwed into the back of your rifle, then the CGS™ was designed specifically with you in mind. Externally the CGS™ is manufactured using a real Milspec buffer tube blank which has been modified to conceal an adjustable regulator and CO2 cartridge which allows you to run your HPA system while retaining the same realistic appearance and the use of traditional Milspec buttstocks.

Its integral regulator shares the same internal design as PolarStar's other compact regulators and delivers performance on par with systems twice its size. This regulator has an output pressure range of 40-130psi which is easily adjusted using a 3/32 allen key but can be locked out using a standard chrono zip tie which blocks the adjustment screw. Additionally, if you want to get a little more ""omph"" out of the regulator, you can install the High Pressure Spring (p/n 10000692)* which boots the maximum output pressure to approximately 200psi. This regulator is coupled with a removable CO2 insert which is easily installed by sliding the insert into the back of the buffer tube and screwing it into the regulator's ASA threads before being secured with a set screw. This modular design makes the CGS™ a very versatile system since you are able to swap between two available CO2 Inserts giving you the ability to use either traditional 12g CO2 cartridges or the magnum sized 33g cartridges (p/n 10000332)* for even more shot capacity.

These inserts feature an integral expansion chamber, anti-siphon system, 5 micron filter and check valve to prevent liquid CO2 from entering the regulator regardless of the rifle's orientation and therefore safeguarding the system from any spikes in pressure. As an added benefit, the internal check valve also prevents gases from escaping the expansion chamber while switching out cartridges so as to conserve as much CO2 as possible when performing a ""combat reload"" and allowing several full-power shots even while when the CO2 cartridge has been removed.

The CGS™ can be used","Sep 2, 2019",https://polarstarairsoft.com/products/cgs-co2-gas-stock
