The FTSE 100 added 0.6%, its best day in nearly 2 weeks, outperforming the broader European markets. Gains in easyJet and Aston Martin helped the domestically-focused FTSE 250 advance 0.4%, despite a hit to the local currency from mounting Brexit jitters. Luxury brand Burberry jumped more than 15% on its best day ever, after it posted a stronger-than-expected rise in first-quarter comparable-store sales and affirmed its annual forecast. “The big question facing Burberry has been to what extent the Chinese consumer is reining in their luxury buying ... Not so much, it seems,” Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said, as the company’s revenue growth in China and across Asia improved. Airline stocks climbed after Ryanair said deliveries of Boeing’s 737 MAX planes may be delayed further, raising the prospects of easing over-capacity in the European market. “It’s just that reduced capacity is what is required for the industry - improved pricing environment which should be supportive of margins,” Wilson said. Shares in Europe’s largest budget carrier, which cut its forecast for growth in traveller numbers next summer, and British Airways owner IAG gained 2.6% each. EasyJet added 5.4% and was the biggest boost to the FTSE 250. Luxury automaker Aston Martin advanced 7.6% after a rating upgrade from Jefferies and a bullish view from Goldman Sachs. The mid-cap index has broken ranks with sterling, defying its positive correlation with the UK’s domestic currency. The index is up 12.3% this year while the pound has slipped 2.7%. The currency slumped on Tuesday to a 27-month low against the U.S. dollar amid increasing concerns of a chaotic, no-deal Brexit.

8,JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines Reaffirm Their Q2 Forecasts | The Motley Fool,JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines Reaffirm Their Q2 Forecasts. JetBlue and Spirit Airlines weren't able to beat their unit revenue,"   Over the past few months, the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX has forced several major U.S. airlines to reduce their domestic capacity. That has paved the way for strong revenue and profit growth at airlines that haven't been affected by the 737 MAX grounding. Delta Air Lines recently reported stellar results for the second quarter, and a couple of other airlines raised their quarterly forecasts last week. As a result, many investors hoped for guidance increases at JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), neither of which operates the 737 MAX. Instead, both carriers reaffirmed their recent forecasts last week. However, JetBlue and Spirit remain on track for strong earnings growth in the second quarter and beyond. Back in April, JetBlue projected that revenue per available seat mile (RASM) would increase 1% to 4% year over year in the second quarter, after falling 3.1% in the first quarter. Last month, the carrier boosted the low end of its Q2 guidance range, saying that RASM would rise 2% to 4% for the quarter. On Thursday, JetBlue said that RASM had increased approximately 3.1% in the second quarter, slightly better than the midpoint of its revised forecast. The company did not provide an update to its cost outlook. JETBLUE'S Q2 RASM GROWTH WAS IN LINE WITH THE AIRLINE'S MOST RECENT FORECAST. IMAGE SOURCE: JETBLUE AIRWAYS. That said, there are some reasons for optimism about JetBlue's cost performance. First, oil prices have declined over the past three months. Thus, JetBlue likely paid less for fuel last quarter than the $2.21 per gallon it had estimated in April, which already would have been lower than its $2.28-per-gallon average price in the prior-year period. JetBlue's initial guidance also called for a modest year-over-year improvement in fuel efficiency. Second, the carrier had another quarter of solid operational performance. JetBlue completed about 99.3% of its scheduled flights last quarter, easily beating its Q2 2018 performance, especially in May and June. This uptick in completion factor may have allowed JetBlue to limit its nonfuel unit cost growth to the lower end of its guidance range for a 1.5% to 3.5% increase. The combination of a solid RASM increase, modest nonfuel unit cost growth, and lower fuel costs should put JetBlue on track to post strong earnings for the second quarter. Analysts currently expect adjusted earnings per share to surge 47% year over year to","Jul 15, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/07/15/jetblue-airways-and-spirit-airlines-reaffirm-their.aspx

11,What investors should do with IndiGo stock as promoters’ feud turns uglier - The Financial Express,What investors should do with IndiGo stock as promoters’ feud turns uglier. IndiGo’s parent company InterGlobe Aviation’s stock has tumbled,"IndiGo’s parent company InterGlobe Aviation’s stock has tumbled over 13% in the last two days after a spat between the airline’s two promoters Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal spilled out in public on Tuesday. InterGlobe Aviation shares traded low continuously for two trading sessions, falling from Rs 1,565.75 on Tuesday’s close to Rs 1,354.85 on Thursday’s close. Today, IndiGo shares opened flat at Rs 1,355 on BSE and inched up later. Several analysts that Financial Express Online spoke to are divided on whether to buy or sell IndiGo shares, amid the controversy shadowing the strong fundamentals of the airline. InterGlobe Aviation is IndiGo’s operating company, jointly promoted by Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal. SEBI has sought clarification from the company. IndiGo co-founder Rakesh Gangwal on Tuesday asked SEBI to intervene in the matter. He alleged several corporate governance violations by co-founder Rahul Bhatia including matters about related-party transactions, the appointment of senior management personnel. “I have vigorously attempted for almost a year to persuade the company to shore up its governance standards, and all my attempts have been thwarted by the IGE Group,” Gangwal said in a letter to SEBI. “Beyond just questionable RPTs, various fundamental governance norms and laws are not being adhered to and this is inevitably going to lead to unfortunate outcomes unless effective measures are taken today,” he added while detailing the gamut of events at the company violating corporate governance norms. Both the co-founders Gangwal and Bhatia each own less than 40% in Interglobe Aviation, giving both co-founders a major say in its strategy and plans. ICICI Securities has maintained a BUY rating on the stock in view of its strong business fundamentals. It said the core issue remains of overriding power of IGE in the board, as per Rakesh Gangwal group, is leading to the decadence of governance standards of IndiGo related to issues of related party transactions (RPTs) between IndiGo and IGE. However, Target Investing has a SELL rating on IndiGo stock as it believes the premium valuation of the company will come down due to promoter dispute. “ We believe due to promoter dispute there will be a reduction in premium valuation the company trades at. In short and medium term there will be volatility and we do not see resolution anytime soon as concerns of Gangwal would be investigated by SEBI and government. We have SELL on the company,” Sameer Kalra,","Jul 15, 2019",https://www.financialexpress.com/market/what-investors-should-do-with-indigo-stock-as-promoters-feud-turns-uglier/1641961/

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Have you been paying attention to shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $62.24 in the previous session. Delta Air Lines has gained 23.6% since the start of the year compared to the 17% move for the Zacks Transportation sector and the 13% return for the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry. What's Driving the Outperformance? The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 11, 2019, Delta reported EPS of $2.35 versus consensus estimate of $2.29 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.3%. For the current fiscal year, Delta is expected to post earnings of $7.04 per share on $46.81 billion in revenues. This represents a 24.6% change in EPS on a 5.35% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $7.32 per share on $48.97 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 3.99% and 4.6%, respectively. Valuation Metrics Delta may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level. On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style. Delta has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.","Jul 15, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-dal-soars-52-week-131501494.html

Guru Purnima 2019:"," Guru Purnima 2019: A guru exists in every field and the field of investment is not an exception. They show the direction of trends and shed light on positive way forward or warn of dire consequences of certain actions, besides acting as well-spring of all kinds of wisdom. In short, they teach and even enlighten. This 'guru gyan' can indeed be very profitable. Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch and our very own Rakesh Jhunjhunwala are such geniuses whom investors follow. Speaking on the role of the above-mentioned geniuses in achieving one's investment goals, Rahul Jain, Head, Personal Wealth Advisory at Edelweiss said, ""These phenomenally successful investors, often touted as 'gurus' in the investment world, have amassed wealth through deft and prudent investments. On this special occasion of Guru Purnima, a day dedicated to remembering and thanking our teachers for their learnings, let us learn key investing lessons from these prominent ones.""  Jain suggested the following top 5 investment lessons that investment gurus like Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala strictly follow while investing:  See Zee Business video below:  1] Be positive Being optimistic is one of the key investment lessons, which the ‘Pied Piper of Indian Equities’ Rakesh Jhunjhunwala strongly advocates. The ace investor has ten commandments of investing and being positive is one among them. It’s important to note that any investment, especially market-linked ones, takes time to generate returns.  Speaking on the returns Rahul Jain of Edelweiss said, ""Returns depend on multiple factors and to be honest, most of them are beyond the control of investors. If you have made a fundamentally sound investment, the returns will follow in the long run."" 2] Invest in what you know When it comes to investing, ignorance can be dangerous. One of the famous investing principles of ace American investor Peter Lynch is to invest in what you know. Investors often land in a soup in their bid to chase high returns from instruments they are unaware of.

16,Best Stock Picks for India’s Electric Vehicle Theme - Research & Ranking,Is India Ready For Electric Vehicles? Which Could Be The Best Stock Picks For Electric Vehicle Theme?. Top stock picks,"Watch a complete video on our webinar on 'Investing In The Post Covid-19 World. What's Next For Investors?'. Watch Now Electric vehicle segment in India is considered as the next big thing and much valuable stock picks for wealth creation can be found in this segment.

Crude oil is a limited resource. According to estimates the world is likely to run out of crude oil completely by the year 2040. That’s why there is a huge potential for vehicles running on electricity in not just India but world over. Switching over to electric vehicles will benefit India in mainly two ways. Firstly, India is one of the top importers of crude oil in the world which not only increases the country’s import bill but also increases our dependency on other countries. According to ratings agency ICRA, every decline in barrel of oil by $10 would mean a saving of $15 billion in India's net oil import bill. India spent $111.9 billion on oil imports in 2018-19, up from $87.8 billion in the previous fiscal year. Secondly, India tops the list of countries with high pollution, a significant proportion of which can be attributed to pollution caused by vehicles. Pollution is a silent killer which not increases the risk of cardio-vascular diseases but also puts a huge strain on the country’s already fragile health care system. Though still in a nascent stage, the electric vehicle segment in India has huge growth potential and is projected to reach $707.4 million by 2025. Government schemes and subsidies have helped immensely in the growth of the market. But many infrastructure challenges remain like the lack of adequate charging stations and high initial cost of buying electric vehicles.

The government is targeting a gradual transition in multiple stages in the form of year 2023 for 3 wheelers, year 2025 for 2 wheelers and 2030 for 4 wheelers to replace from current internal combustion engines (ICE). For boosting electric vehicle segment in India, government has introduced the FAME 2 scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid vehicles) which offers subsidy for electronic vehicle buyers with a budget allocation of Rs 10,000 crore.

The NDA government under PM Narendra Modi has setup an ambitious target of all-electric vehicle fleet in India by the year 2030.  The idea behind this huge aspiration is to reduce the import bill on fossil fuels like petrol and diesel as well curb","Jul 16, 2019",https://researchandranking.com/blog/3-best-stock-picks-for-electric-vehicle-sector-in-india

During the same period"," Amid a bitter spat between IndiGo promoters Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, Interglobe Aviation Ltd secured credit facility worth Rs 2,577.75 crore since April. This includes a credit facility of Rs 867.43 crore from Deutsche Bank AG in June after the airline pledged its investment in three mutual fund schemes managed by Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Asset Management and SBI Mutual Fund, reported Mint. In May, the airline secured Rs 660.32 crore worth of secured facilities from Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, the daily added. For this, the airline pledged an exclusive charge over its fixed deposits (FDs). On April 4, the airline secured a credit facility worth Rs 1,050 crore from Standard Charted Bank, which was approved on IndiGo's MF investments and lien over its FDs worth Rs 185 crore, which also included interests, renewals or rollovers on these schemes. Notably, the total credit facility availed by IndiGo is three times the facility availed during the corresponding quarter last year. During this period in 2018, the airline had secured the credit facility worth Rs 778 crore from Kotak Mahindra Bank and HSBC on MF investments and lien on its FDs. India's largest airline, which had a fleet of 217 aircraft as on March 31, 2019, was embroiled in a controversy after one of the IndiGo promoters, Rakesh Gangwal, recently accused his partner and co-founder Rahul Bhatia of corporate governance lapses. Comparing IndiGo with a betel shop, Gangwal said even a ""paan ki dukaan"" would have managed matters with more grace. Gangwal also alleged the shareholders' agreement provided Bhatia unusual controlling rights over IndiGo. Bhatia and his affiliates (InterGlobe Enterprises Group) refuted Gangwal's allegations, saying the airline was running well and was managed by a competent set of managers. Gangwal, along with his affiliates, holds around 37 per cent stake in InterGlobe Aviation. Co-founder Rahul Bhatia and his affiliates (IGE Group) has around 38 per cent stake. InterGlobe Aviation (or IndiGo) is also the parent of the country's largest airline IndiGo.
