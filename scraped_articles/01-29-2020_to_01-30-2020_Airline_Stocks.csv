RECOVERY WITH THE FT Myles McCormick in London Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story Hedge funds including Citadel and Marshall Wace have ramped up their short positions against airlines disrupted by the spread of a deadly coronavirus in China, as carriers cancel flights to the country. So-called short interest in the shares of Air France-KLM and Lufthansa has risen this week as speculators placed bets that their market value would head lower. The airlines’ share prices have already tumbled this month — both falling about 13 per cent — on concerns over their exposure to the Chinese market. Disclosed short positions in Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM represented 4.55 per cent of the total shares outstanding on Monday, the highest since mid-2018, according to data from analytics company Breakout Point. At Germany’s Lufthansa they hit 3.86 per cent on Tuesday, the highest since mid-2017. Chinese authorities are racing to control the virus that has swept through the country and killed more than 130 people. The prospect of people reducing travel to and from China, either by choice or because of travel bans, has shaken the airline industry. Lufthansa said on Wednesday that it would suspend flights to mainland China until February 9, following a similar move by British Airways and a decision by Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific to halve the number of its flights to and from the Chinese mainland. Air France has cancelled flights to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, but said it planned to continue operating on routes to Shanghai and Beijing for now. Many analysts have compared the new virus to the 2003 Sars outbreak that also emerged from China, and which Lufthansa’s then-chief executive described as aviation’s “worst-ever crisis”. That disease cost airlines billions of dollars in revenue and sent passenger numbers plummeting, especially at Asia-Pacific and North American carriers. Air France-KLM and Lufthansa are the European airlines most exposed to the Chinese market, according to analysts at Citigroup. Air France-KLM relies on mainland China for 3.6 per cent of total revenues, according to FactSet, while at Lufthansa, the figure is 1.9 per cent. But as a result of its lossmaking operations in its domestic market, Air France-KLM is particularly dependent on Asia for its profits, according to analysts. Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel disclosed a new short position of 1.43 per cent against Air France-KLM, with Marshall Wace and Sandbar","Jan 29, 2020",https://www.ft.com/content/0f13e2d0-4297-11ea-abea-0c7a29cd66fe

5,Coronavirus: British Airways cancels all flights to and from China,British Airways cancels all flights to and from mainland China on coronavirus fears. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"British Airways has stopped all direct flights to and from mainland China because of the coronavirus outbreak. The airline said the suspension would be implemented “with immediate effect” following the viral outbreak that has caused 132 deaths and infected more than 6,000 people. Beijing authorities have continued efforts to contain the virus, while other countries have begun to evacuate their citizens from the region. Almost all deaths from the flu-like virus have occurred in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei, which remains on virtual lockdown. See: Coronavirus live updates British Airways normally operates daily flights to Shanghai and Beijing from Heathrow, but on Wednesday morning these were canceled without any indication of when they would resume. “We have suspended all flights to and from mainland China with immediate effect following advice from the Foreign Office against all but essential travel,” British Airways said in a statement. The airline apologized to travelers for the inconvenience but said “the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority.” US. carrier United Airlines has already said it was suspending 24 U.S. flights to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai between Feb. 1 and 8 because of low demand. Air Canada and Cathay Pacific have also said they will reduce the number of flights in and out of China while Korean carrier Air Seoul has said it will halt all flights to China. Indonesia’s Lion Air said in a statement Wednesday that it would suspend all flights to China from February. Indigo, the Indian budget carrier, is to cancel all flights between Delhi and Chengdu from Feb. 1. Its regular flight to Guangzhou will continue. Travel and airline stocks have fallen sharply over the last two weeks as fears over the potential of the coronavirus to become a global pandemic have grown. On Wednesday, shares of British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group fell before rising 0.2% by 10 a.m. London time. The decision by BA follows an advisory by the U.K. Foreign Office that says only essential travel should be taken to anywhere in China. In the United States, the White House has told airline executives it had been considering suspending flights from China, people familiar with the matter have told CNBC.

CNBC Newsletters","Stocks closed higher on Thursday after a sharp comeback late in the session erased earlier losses stemming from concerns around the coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 124 points, or 0.4%. At its low of the day, the Dow was down 244 points. The S&P 500 ended the day up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.3%. The major averages started paring losses with roughly one hour to go after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency, but at the same time, did not recommend travel to China be restricted and said the country had the situation under control.   Airline stocks also rebounded, with American and United each closing more than 3% higher. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, two coronavirus proxies for their gaming exposure in Macao, ended the day up  more than 2% each. Stocks were down for most of the session as the death toll in China from the coronavirus hit 171, with confirmed cases of the virus surpassing 8,000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later confirmed the first human-to-human transmission of the virus in the U.S., pushing the major indexes back towards their session lows. “The spread of the Wuhan virus isn’t accelerating, but markets becoming more concerned about future earnings and economic growth as companies implement work stoppages to reduce the chance of the disease spreading,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. Microsoft led the Dow higher with a 2.8% gain after the tech giant reported better-than-expected quarterly results. That rise pushed the S&P 500 into record territory, advancing 0.9%. Still, concerns over the coronavirus and how it will impact remain. Investors increased their exposure to bonds, briefly pushing the 10-year Treasury yield below its 3-month counterpart, triggering a so-called inversion. Traders worry when the yield curve inverts because, in the past, this event has preceded recessionary periods.  “This tells us that investors are reconsidering, at least in the near term, how they feel about the growth prospects of this country. And not just that, but global GDP,” said Yousef Abbasi, director of U.S. institutional equities at INTL FCStone. “So with that in mind, the question becomes, how can you justify paying a multiple of 18.5 times earnings, when the bond market is kind of telling you that growth prospects are starting to diminish or potentially be impacted in a negative way?” Stocks have","Jan 30, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/30/us-futures-point-to-sharply-lower-open-on-wall-street.html

8,Travel stocks fall as coronavirus spreads | Morningstar,Travel stocks fall as coronavirus spreads. And create attractive buying opportunities for long term investors. . Your stock insights and,"   The outbreak of the contagious coronavirus in China and its rapid spread to other parts of the world has triggered widespread panic. As death toll climbs and countries scramble to contain the spread of the mysterious new virus and its catastrophic effects that could potentially be 10 times bigger than the SARS epidemic, the ripples of anxiety have travelled far and wide rocking stock markets globally. The travel-related stocks – from airlines to online travel agencies and hospitality -- have been amongst the worst hit. For pragmatic long-term investors, though, the potential pandemic has created rare buying opportunities with some travel stocks dipping too far too quickly. At a time like this, it bears repeating that the travel and tourism sector remains one of the strongest pillars of the global economy, creating millions of jobs and accounting for more than 10% of global GDP, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). Leading travel companies may not be immune tomacroeconomic events, but their growth prospects and business fundamentals make them reliable prospects for long-term investment. History shows any short-term health scare only creates new entry points, further enhancing the attractiveness of these stocks, before things bounce back.

9,"737 MAX crisis throws Boeing for a loss, but stock rises out of relief - GeekWire","737 MAX crisis throws Boeing for a loss for 2019, but stock price rises out of relief. Figuring out 2021","by Alan Boyle on January 29, 2020 at 8:36 amJanuary 29, 2020 at 1:54 pm Boeing doubled its estimate for the financial effect of the 737 MAX crisis today and recorded a net annual loss for the first time since 1997 — but the company’s stock price rose nevertheless, reflecting market sentiment that the worst may be over. An additional $9.2 billion was set aside to cover projected costs associated with the aftermath of two catastrophic crashes involving a 737 MAX 8 jet in Indonesia in 2018 and the same model in Ethiopia in 2019. That brought the total projected cost to $18.4 billion. The costs are coming in the form of lost deliveries and concessions because of the worldwide grounding of all MAX jets, as well as increases in production costs. Boeing expects to incur further costs in 2020 that will factor into the $18.4 billion, primarily due to production snags. Even though 737 MAX production is being temporarily suspended, Boeing is keeping its workforce intact. (Boeing’s suppliers, however, have announced thousands of layoffs.) Because of the costs to date, Boeing reported a net loss of $636 million for 2019, compared with a $10.5 billion profit for 2018. Profits in other business divisions, including space and defense as well as services, couldn’t fully make up for Boeing Commercial Airlines’ $6.7 billion loss. The narrow-body 737 MAX isn’t the only airplane line facing challenges: Boeing said the production rate for its wide-body 787 Dreamliner would be cut back from 14 to 12 airplanes per month in late 2020, and was likely to be further adjusted to 10 planes per month in early 2021. The company said the rate could return to 12 planes per month in 2023, based on projections focusing on the Chinese market. Boeing’s final frontier is also facing a challenging year: Last month, Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner space taxi failed to get to the International Space Station as intended during its first uncrewed orbital test. In today’s quarterly financial report, the company said it’s taking a $410 million pre-tax charge to provide for the possibility that it’ll have to conduct a do-over of the uncrewed test before proceeding to crewed missions. NASA and Boeing are currently evaluating the data collected during December’s uncrewed orbital test flight, and the space agency is expected to decide within the next month or so whether another uncrewed flight will be required. “We","Jan 29, 2020",https://www.geekwire.com/2020/737-max-crisis-throws-boeing-loss-2019-stock-price-rises-relief/

The coronavirus outbreak from Wuhan has hit Hong Kong","Hong Kong stocks resumed trading on Wednesday after the break for the Lunar New Year. They got crushed, with the death toll from the new coronavirus now at 132, and more people infected in China than during the SARS outbreak. The Hang Seng Index closed with a 2.8% loss, having broken for the holiday at half-time on Friday. Markets in the mainland have postponed their resumption from this Friday to Monday, in line with China's decision to lengthen the New Year holiday. But that's a tentative date at best, with the infection count for WARS having rapidly risen by one-third overnight, to 5,974 patients in the mainland. Those are the official Chinese figures for what Hong Kongers are calling Wuhan Acute Respiratory Syndrome. But there's chaos in mainland hospitals, causing patients to be turned away or give up waiting to see doctors. There's footage circulating of sick people waiting to see a doctor while what appear to be dead people lie covered on gurneys in the hospital hallways. Patients who died early in the outbreak were cremated as quickly as possible, often without testing. The stock market in Hong Kong may have reopened, but little else in the city is functioning. Civil servants have been told to work from home the rest of the week, and companies are encouraged to tell their employees to do the same. Since the stock market no longer has a physical trading floor, getting digital trading back online isn't too much of a stretch. The Shanghai government has ordered businesses not to restart operations until Feb. 9, a week later than normal. That will hit foreign manufacturers with operations in the city, such as Tesla (TSLA) , with its new Tesla Giga Factory producing its first China-made cars in December, as well as General Motors (GM) and Volkswagen (VWAGY) . Companies with factories in Wuhan will see even worse disruption. They include Honda Motor (HMC) , Nissan Motor (NSANY) , Renault (RNLSY) , Peugeot-Citroen (PUGOY) , and the Chinese automakers SAIC Motor SH:600104, Dongfeng Motor Group (DNFGY) and Geely Automobile Holdings (GELYY) . The SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 eventually killed 813 people, according to the World Health Organization, 90% of them in greater China.

12,Why IndiGo shares are flying low despite trebling profits,Why IndiGo shares are flying low despite trebling profits. . ,"  InterGlobe Aviation Ltd’s shares rose about 3% in early trading on Tuesday, after the company reported a 205% jump in pre-tax profit for the December quarter. InterGlobe runs IndiGo, India’s largest airline. But the shares gave up most of those gains since, ending the day 2.8% lower. That’s because the skies are looking a bit cloudy from a near-term perspective. In a post-earnings conference call, Ronojoy Dutta, chief executive officer of IndiGo, said: “As we move to the seasonally weak fourth quarter, we will find it difficult to produce year-on-year improvement in unit revenues because we will be comparing ourselves against a base period when Jet Airways’ capacity was beginning to decline."" Besides, InterGlobe Aviation is facing some headwinds with regards to employee and maintenance costs. In any case, the huge jump in Q3 profits came off an extremely low base, and the growth in revenue was largely driven by an increase in capacity. It’s interesting to note that passenger yield rose just 1.2% on a year-on-year basis. Passenger yield is a measure of average fare paid per kilometre, per passenger. Non-fuel unit costs rose 17%, although the drop in oil prices put a lid on overall costs. Revenue passenger km rose over 22%, tracking the growth in capacity, and drove revenue and profit growth. InterGlobe Aviation had further lowered its capacity guidance in December, with available seat km expected to increase 23% in FY20. “We believe the cut in capacity growth guidance is a blessing in disguise, as the demand environment is weak and strong capacity addition would put pressure on yields,"" analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients. Already, analysts are a tad disappointed with the trend in yields, especially given that one large competitor exited the market last year. “With low yielding capacity (LCCs) largely taking over Jet Airways’ slots, there is an increase in competitive intensity especially on the metro to metro routes,"" Paarth Gala of Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd wrote in a note. The rise in non-fuel cost is a worry too. “We expect IndiGo’s Cask (cost per available seat km) to remain under pressure in the near term due to increase in maintenance cost due to re-assessment of contracts, DGCA deadline to replace unmodified engines on all A320neos by 31st May 2020; and underutilized pilots/aircrafts,"" added Gala.

13,3 Value Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now | The Motley Fool,"3 Value Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now. Even in the most expensive stock market in history, it's still","   January 2020 has been one for the record books. On Jan. 15, the Dow Jones Industrial Average passed 29,000 for the first time, and it remained above that benchmark for more than a week before it slumped back below it on Friday. And yet, even with the stock market as a whole near record highs, there are plenty of individual stocks that are still trading at bargain-basement valuations. Here are three such stocks, each of which cost less than the market average price-to-earnings ratio of 24.8, paying more than the average 1.9% dividend yield, and growing faster than the average long-term projected growth rate of 9.3%: Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY), and Wabash National (NYSE:WNC). IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.     The  second-highest-rated airline in America according to The Wall Street Journal -- and the absolute best airline in the country for transforming frequent flyer miles into free domestic flights and first-class seats -- Alaska Air Group is also arguably one of the cheapest value stocks on the market today.   It's trading at just 13.3 times earnings and with a dividend that yields 2.1%. Now, based on those numbers, for the shares to be considered a fair value, you'd ordinarily expect to find analysts forecasting about  11% annual growth for Alaska Air. But analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence predict that the airline will grow its earnings nearly twice as fast as that -- better than 20% annually over the next five years. Strong growth rates and a low price relative to earnings give Alaska Air stock a bargain-basement PEG ratio of just 0.66, and a total return ratio of 0.6 -- well below the standard value investing target of a stock trading for less than a ""1.0"" ratio. This cheapness may be a hangover from investors upset at Alaska Air's sharp decline in profit margins in 2018. But margins are already on the upswing again today. Given the stock's very moderate debt for its size, strong earnings, and strong free cash flow, I think this cheapness is a mistake -- and an opportunity to buy. Granted, for Alaska Air stock to be as cheap as it looks, earnings will need to grow as fast as analysts are projecting. The good news here is that so far, it appears to be doing just that.

14,How Hard Will the Wuhan Coronavirus Hit Chinese Stocks? | The Motley Fool,How Hard Will the Wuhan Coronavirus Hit Chinese Stocks?. The outbreak could hit a lot of sectors across the Chinese,"   The rapid spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, which has claimed over 170 lives and infected over 7,000 patients in China so far, is sparking serious concerns about Chinese stocks. Let's see how this outbreak could affect Chinese companies, many of which were already struggling with China's economic slowdown. The Chinese government has already locked down over a dozen cities to contain the virus, and many cities have been suspending public transportation, taxis, and ride-hailing services. Air travel between Chinese cities is being tightly controlled, and overseas airlines are either canceling or changing their flights into China. Therefore, investors should steer clear of Chinese online travel agencies like Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM), hotel chains like Huazhu Group, and airlines like China Southern Airlines (NYSE:ZNH). Analysts will likely revise their estimates for these companies once they gain a deeper understanding of the outbreak, and the revalued stocks could head significantly lower. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Luckin Coffee (OTC:LKNC.Y), which recently surpassed Starbucks as China's largest coffee chain (by store count), will also likely lose business as more consumers stay indoors. Luckin's revenue has been rising by triple-digit percentages since its IPO last year, but that meteoric growth was mainly driven by new store openings and steep promotions. Its losses are still widening, and the coronavirus could prevent its new stores from generating sustainable comps growth. Companies that generate most of their revenue from display ads could also struggle since the outbreak will likely throttle China's economic growth and force companies to rein in their marketing expenses. The ongoing slowdown of China's economy -- which is growing at its slowest rate in three decades -- already hurt advertising heavyweights like Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Weibo over the past year. The coronavirus outbreak could exacerbate that slowdown, and crush those companies' hopes for a cyclical recovery. The longer consumers stay home, the more likely they'll use e-commerce platforms like Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com. Both e-commerce leaders generated strong growth throughout 2019 as the country's economy stalled, and the coronavirus outbreak could boost their online orders throughout 2020. China's video game industry should also hold up well, as long as the government doesn't suspend new gaming approvals again or implement tougher playtime restrictions. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), which generates most of its revenue from video games and has less exposure to ads than its larger rival Tencent, should be well-insulated from the coronavirus fears.

British Airways and","British Airways announced plans to suspend flights to mainland China this week. The coronavirus continues to deter commercial travel among tourists and business people. We’ve now seen hedge funds take direct aim at the stocks of major airline companies that service the Asian markets. Citadel and Marshall Wallace have joined their peers in shorting companies exposed to China. Speculators took a special interest in Air France-KLM and Lufthansa. Shares of both stocks are trading about 13% lower since the start of the month. Short float hit 4.55% on Air France KLM, while it hit 3.86% on Lufthansa’s stock n the German market. Citadel has disclosed a net short position of 1.43% on Air France-KLM. Lufthansa announced Wednesday that it planned to halt flights to China until February 9. That followed news from British Airways and Cathay Pacific to limit travel to the region. Air France will not flight to Wuhan, the center of the outbreak. However, it has not suspended travel to Beijing or Shanghai yet. The firm may experience the biggest impact given its exposure to the Chinese market and dependence on revenue from the Asian markets. At the moment, more Chinese citizens have contracted the coronavirus than the number of people who contracted SARs in 2003.
