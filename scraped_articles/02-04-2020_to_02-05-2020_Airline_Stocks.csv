2,Stocks Rally to Records as Investors’ Coronavirus Concerns Ease - WSJ,"Stocks Rally to Records as Investors’ Coronavirus Concerns Ease. Nasdaq hits its second straight record, while S&P 500 rises 1.1%"," U.S. stocks rallied Wednesday, largely erasing the losses sparked by reaction to China’s coronavirus outbreak, while oil prices posted their biggest gain in more than a month. Investors have cheered quarterly earnings and growth projections from the world’s largest companies in recent days, as well as signs that the manufacturing sector in both the U.S. and Europe may be stabilizing. Concerns about the deadly virus have faded in the absence of immediate signs that the disruption to businesses in China could affect other nations. “The story in the market is the repricing of the virus fear,’’ said Peter Schaffrik, a global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “What people are currently looking at is the rate of spread of the outbreak: The number of cases is still going up, but the growth rate is slowing down.’’ The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 483.22 points, or 1.7%, to 29290.85. The S&P 500 advanced 37.10 points, or 1.1%, to 3334.69. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose 40.71 points, or 0.4%, to 9508.68.

3,Why Shares of American and Other Airlines Are Climbing Higher Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of American and Other Airlines Are Climbing Higher Today. The stocks are gaining and losing altitude based on,"   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) both traded up more than 5% on Tuesday afternoon, caught up in a broader surge higher as markets brush off concerns about the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in China. The airlines were among the biggest losers as virus fears were growing, with both stocks down more than 12% for the month in late January, and are bouncing back now that the panic is at least temporarily subsiding. The coronavirus outbreak has weighed heavy on investors for weeks now, with airline stocks under pressure due to concerns over revenue lost to canceled flights, and vacationers deciding to defer travel out of fear of getting sick. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. American and United were among the airlines most affected, but for different reasons. American has the highest debt burden among major airlines and is seen as the most vulnerable to an unexpected drop in demand. United is the U.S. airline most exposed to the China market, with an estimated 4% of its capacity tied to China and 15% tied to the Asia Pacific region. In comparison, American has about 2% of its capacity tied to China and 6% to Asia, and Delta Air Lines about 3% and 9%, respectively. Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) is also moving higher on Tuesday. Though Hawaiian Airlines has no China capacity, it is No. 1 among U.S. airlines in exposure to Asia, which accounts for close to one-fourth of its revenue. In recent days all the major airlines have canceled flights to China into April, a move that helped put investors at ease -- it's better for the companies not to operate service when there's no demand, rather than have the expense of flying nearly empty planes. A general sentiment that China is moving to contain the virus, and is willing to stimulate its economy to make sure there are no long-term ramifications of the outbreak, is also helping move airline shares and other stocks higher on Tuesday. The outbreak is far from over, and a new batch of headlines announcing an uptick in cases could easily send stocks in the opposite direction tomorrow. But today's trading action should serve as a reminder that the weakness is tied to the outbreak, and buy-and-hold investors are best served by riding out the crisis and the headlines without making a move.

4,American Airlines Q4 Earnings Could Signal a Turnaround | The Motley Fool,American Airlines Q4 Earnings Could Signal a Turnaround. The struggling airline seems to be making a comeback.. A reprieve. Addressing,"   American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has had a rough go of it the last five years, losing nearly half of its value. Amid an onslaught of the fallout from the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX groundings, uncertain future growth, and a weak balance sheet, things weren't looking good for American Airlines until the company reported some positive news in its fourth quarter 2019 report. Is a turnaround in store for the airline, or are its problems far from over?  AAL DATA BY YCHARTS As the second-largest owner of 737 MAX aircraft behind Southwest Airlines, American Airlines has spent 10 tiresome months dealing with the consequences of an undersized fleet by canceling flights and reassessing the timeline for the MAX's return to service. American had originally planned to have 100 737 MAX 8 aircraft in its fleet, but the additional 76 aircraft, like all orders, have been placed on hold. American blamed the MAX groundings as the primary reason it didn't have better third quarter 2019 results, and in the fourth quarter of 2019, CEO Doug Parker noted the groundings have brought ""a lot of uncertainty and frustration to our customers, our team and our shareholders."" Parker went on to say, ""The financial cost of the MAX grounding should be borne by Boeing shareholders, not American. We're pleased that recently, we reached a confidential settlement with Boeing to compensate American for the financial damages we incurred in 2019 due to the grounding of the MAX.""  Going forward, American has suspended flying of the MAX through June 3, 2020, and plans to hold Boeing accountable for future financial damages.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In its fourth quarter 2019 report, American Airlines announced an aggressive goal of $6 billion in Free Cash Flow (FCF) over the next two years. The surge in FCF should help American fix what may be its biggest problem: debt. American Airlines has more net long-term debt than the other five major U.S. airlines combined. Also concerning is American's debt to capital (D/C) ratio, which is the highest of the group and now exceeds 100%, meaning the company is highly leveraged and prone to using debt financing over equity financing.

7,How Airlines Feel the Effect of Terrorism,How Airlines Feel the Effect of Terrorism. . KEY TAKEAWAYS. Predictable Stock Drop Across Carriers. Ryanair . easyJet. International Airlines,"When terrorists strike—as they did during the November 2015 Paris attacks and the March 2016 Brussels bombings—the effects reverberate across the globe. These high-profile and devastating tragedies impact human behavior in a variety of ways, particularly immediately after the event. People often rethink their travel plans after an attack, becoming more cautious about traveling to certain parts of the world. This change in behavior directly leads to the changes airlines see in the number of passengers booking flights. By reviewing the financial statements for specific carriers, we can get a clearer picture of how terrorism, such as the attacks on Paris and Brussels, affects the airline industry. Most of the major European airlines announced their earnings relatively soon after the Paris attacks. A majority of those reports mentioned weakening demand. The effects were worsened after the 2016 Brussels bombings, likely because the attacks occurred in an airport terminal and metro station.1﻿ 2 Europe's largest low-cost airline lost over 10% of its stock value in the six months following the Paris attacks, eventually culminating in a more than 25% loss following the Brussels bombings.3﻿  After the attacks, Europe’s number two low-cost carrier reported a half-year loss of $34.6 million.4﻿ The company said a few things contributed to these results. French air traffic controllers went on strike earlier that spring, which caused hundreds of flights to be canceled. In addition, the company said the terrorist attacks affected the demand for air travel. The airliner lowered their ticket prices in an attempt to get people back in the air.5﻿  Subsidiaries British Airways and Iberia, as well as Irish carrier Aer Lingus, stated that demand in March 2016 was notably weaker due to the attacks in Brussels.6﻿ 7﻿ ""Revenue trends in quarter two have been affected by the aftermath of the Brussels terrorist attacks, as well as some softness in underlying premium demand,” IAG CEO Willie Walsh said in a statement. “As a result, IAG has moderated its short-term capacity growth plans.""8 Commonly referred to as Lufthansa, Europe’s largest airline also reported weakness in the same quarter. They attributed most of their issues with increased competition and pricing. Chief Financial Officer Simone Menne mentioned the company saw weakening demand by both U.S. and Asian group bookings after the Brussels attacks.9﻿ 10 Another of Europe’s large airlines said they lost roughly $76 million in the aftermath of the Paris attacks.

Focus: North American large caps MARKET OUTLOOK U.S. gross domestic product for the fourth quarter was moderately disappointing and other economic signals in the U.S. economy continue to point to a slow rate of growth. In spite of very low unemployment, we see no signs of inflation and have no reason to believe that interest rates will increase in the near future. Corporate earnings for the fourth quarter have come in much as expected. Under these circumstances, we view most stocks as close to fully priced, with moderate upside expected in special situations where growth is higher than the overall economy. Low interest rates continue to push yield-seeking investors into higher dividend-paying stocks, which continue to present an attractive risk/reward picture. TOP PICKS David Baskin of Baskin Wealth shares his top picks: Delta Airlines, Tricon Capital and CCL Industries. DELTA AIRLINES (DAL NASD) We think Delta Airlines shares are cheap after falling from fears the coronavirus will impact global travel. The airline industry’s resiliency continues to be underappreciated following years of consolidation. Delta is the best in-class airline, with industry-leading profitability and reliability while a strong balance sheet, non-unionized workforce and diverse revenue streams make it well positioned to weather any potential downturn. TRICON CAPITAL (TCN TSX) Tricon Capital is an owner of single-family rental (SFR) houses, owning over 20,000 houses and 7,000 apartments in the U.S. Sun Belt. The SFR industry was created following the financial crisis and scale in technology and maintenance is required to manage a sprawling network of homes. The SFR industry will benefit from demographic tailwinds such as high student debt and delayed household formation rates. As the SFR industry matures, Tricon can shift its revenue streams increasingly to institutional asset management fees, which will increase returns. CCL INDUSTRIES (CCL/B TSX) CCL Industries is the world’s largest label maker and the only company with global scale to service multinational giants","Feb 4, 2020",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/david-baskin-s-top-picks-feb-4-2020-1.1384899

You can review all of Tuesday's developments 'as they happened' here. Good morning and welcome to the FT's rolling coverage of the novel coronavirus outbreak. As the disease continues to spread, US airlines United and American have have suspended flights to Hong Kong, in a blow to the Asian financial centre. Chinese authorities, meanwhile, are coming under growing pressure over their handling of the virus, with one World Health Organisation expert breaking ranks to criticise the time it took for the country to initially report cases. We will have the latest developments and reaction as we get them throughout the day, so follow along here. Naomi Rovnick writes: China’s 31 provinces reported 3,887 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, according to the latest round-up by the China National Health Commission. The vast proportion of these were reported by Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. This takes the total number of confirmed cases in China to 24,324, with 490 deaths. The semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau have confirmed 18 and 10 cases respectively, with one death so far in Hong Kong. Despite the World Health Organization having publicly praised the government of Xi Jinping’s handling of the virus, senior WHO expert John Mackenzie has broken ranks and accused China of not reporting cases quickly enough in the early stages of the outbreak, the FT’s Primrose Riordan and Sue-Lin Wong report here. Naomi Rovnick reports: United Airlines said it will suspend services to the Asian financial centre, days after it also cut its mainland China flights. This came just after American Airlines announced a similar step. Both American and United have halted their services to Hong Kong until February 20. British carriers that have stopped flying to China, such as British Airways and Virgin, are still selling flights to Hong Kong.
