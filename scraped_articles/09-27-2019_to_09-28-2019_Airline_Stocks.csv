0,Delta Air Lines Stock Dips After $1.9 Billion Investment In Latam; Latam Airlines Stock Soars | Investor's Business Daily,Delta Air Lines Just Made Its Biggest Investment Since 2008. Analysts See Delta Air Lines Stock Upside. Latam Airlines Stock,"BREAKING: Futures Rise On Big Gains For Nike, Banks    New to Investors.com? Delta Air Lines (DAL) said it would invest $1.9 billion for a 20% stake in Chile-based Latam Airlines (LTM), a move that represents Delta's biggest investment in more than a decade as it tries to widen its flight coverage across Latin America. Delta Air Lines stock gave up gains, while Latam Airlines stock soared. The investment, announced late Thursday, is Delta's largest since it merged with Northwest in 2008. The partnership, with Latin America's largest airline, will open up more routes between North America and South America, and build off Delta's partnership with Aeromexico, a collaboration that handles more than 400 flights between the U.S. and Mexico. Delta said that the two carriers, working together, would take passengers to 435 locations worldwide. ""With their complementary networks, Delta, Latam and their partners will be able to offer access to a greatly expanded array of worldwide destinations,"" Delta said in a statement. ""Together, the partnership will provide greater customer convenience, a more seamless travel experience and better connect customers with the rest of the world."" Delta said it expected the deal with Latam Airlines to add to its earnings per share over the next two years. The carrier also said the partnership wouldn't affect shareholder returns or other financial targets laid out to investors. Delta also said it would dump its minority stake in GOL Airlines (GOL), in Brazil. Delta's investment will come through a public tender offer at $16 per share. The airline will also invest $350 million to help set up the partnership. The deal will also give the carrier representation on Latam's board. Delta will also get four Airbus (EADSY) A350 jets from LATAM, and will take on a commitment from Latam to buy 10 more. Those jets will be delivered from 2020 to 2025. Stephens analyst Jack Atkins, in a research note on Thursday, took the news as positive, ""given this is the last big geographic hole for DAL internationally to fill in with partnerships."" The deal could also boost profits in the region, the way the U.S. airline industry's trans-Atlantic partnerships have, Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note Thursday. And he said it would give Delta the second most flight coverage between the U.S. and South America. But he also said the deal, which he expected to go to","Sep 27, 2019",https://www.investors.com/news/delta-air-lines-stock-investment-latam-airlines-stock/
1,Shares of American Airlines Could Be Ready for Takeoff After a Very Bad Year | Barron's,American Airlines Stock Is Ready for Takeoff. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily. . . . Here’s BofA’s List of 4,"  A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.  Nothing seems to be going right for American Airlines Group this year. Boeing grounded the 737 MAX, taking 24 of American’s 956 mainline jets out of service. Negotiations with the union representing American’s mechanics have yielded bitterness. Customers are cranky, with the airline near the bottom of the rankings on lost luggage and on-time arrivals. Just this past week, The Wall Street Journal published an account of passengers stranded in Peru for three days as an 18-year-old plane suffered multiple mechanical problems. The troubles have hammered the company’s shares
(ticker: AAL), which, like those of other airlines, face fears over recession. Some investors are betting that this is about as bad as it gets. If the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX can return to service
and a contract is reached with the mechanics union, the reasoning goes, the shares could be ready for takeoff.   American fetches just five times estimated 2020 earnings of $5.50 a share. Its stock is the worst performing major airline over the past year, dropping 33%, far worse than the 3% average drop of airline peers over the same span. The rest of the group isn’t exactly soaring: U.S. carriers trade for less than eight times estimated 2020 earnings, a 60% discount to other consumer-discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 index. “At this valuation level, we believe investors are more than compensated for lower margins and a riskier balance sheet,” wrote Jamie Baker, a J.P. Morgan analyst, in a recent research report. He rates American shares an Overweight, with a $40 price target. Baker has a novel way of finding a bargain: the “down 30 in 30 rule.” The longtime analyst says that when an airline stock loses 30% of its value in 30 days, as American did from July 24 to Aug. 27, it’s a sign of investor capitulation—and quite possibly the bottom. The Fort Worth, Texas–based airline admits to some misses: “2019 should have been much better for American,” Robert Isom, the airline’s president, said at a September investor conference. The labor dispute hurt operations, and the 737 MAX grounding increased costs, preventing American from pursuing “fleet harmonization,” or flying fewer plane types to lower operating costs by simplifying pilot training and maintenance. The MAX has been grounded since mid-March after","Sep 27, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/shares-of-american-airlines-could-be-ready-for-takeoff-after-a-very-bad-year-51569605713
2,Why LATAM Airlines Stock Just Soared 31% | The Motley Fool,Why LATAM Airlines Stock Just Soared 31%. Delta drops its stake in the airline Gol Linhas in favor of LATAM..,"   Shares of LATAM Airlines Group (NYSE: LTM) are on fire this morning, up 30.8% as of 10:10 a.m. EDT on news that Delta (NYSE:DAL) will enter into a partnership with the Chilean company and buy 20% of it. Delta's own stock is up only a fraction of a percentage point, while a third company -- Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (NYSE:GOL) -- is taking a much bigger hit, down 6.4%. IMAGE SOURCE: LATAM AIRLINES. As CNBC explained today, Delta plans to cash in its stake in Gol, shares of which have nearly tripled over the past year. (Gol competes with LATAM.) Switching horses, Delta will join with LATAM ""to form the leading airline partnership throughout the Americas,"" offering what it says are the most flights to five of the top six Latin American markets from the U.S.   Now for the dollars and cents: Delta will buy 20% of LATAM's shares for $16 per share -- $1.9 billion in total -- and invest a further $350 million to deepen its partnership with the Chilean carrier. Delta will also flex its financial muscle to acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM, and take over the latter's commitment to buy 10 more A350s from Airbus from 2020 through 2025. LATAM believes the new alliance will enable it to boost free cash flow and pay down more than $2 billion in debt through 2025. Today's 31% jump in LATAM's stock probably caught a lot of eyeballs -- and its run probably isn't done just yet. Delta's plan to pay $16 a share for its LATAM stock, when compared with its current share price of less than $12, suggests there could still be another 33% or more of upside left in this stock.

Find out which of these stocks benefited from a","   The stock market lost ground on Friday, giving into pressure stemming from an possible escalation in the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. A threat to limit U.S. investment in China included a look at potentially requiring Chinese companies to de-list their shares on U.S. exchanges, and that eliminated any hopes that relations between the two nations were improving. Still, some stocks managed to post solid gains. Latam Airlines Group (NYSE: LTM), Arcus Biosciences (NYSE:RCUS), and Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) were among the top performers. Here's why they did so well. Shares of Latam Airlines Group soared 31% after the Chilean airline partnered up with Delta Air Lines. Delta will take a 20% interest in Latam for $1.9 billion and will invest an additional $350 million in order to help Latam as it ends its previous partnership with American Airlines Group. As part of the deal, Latam will leave the Oneworld alliance program, which included American. The move shows just how valuable the Latin American travel market is, especially at a time when U.S. airlines are flush with cash and looking to shore up strategic alliances across the globe. IMAGE SOURCE: LATAM AIRLINES. Biopharmaceutical company Arcus Biosciences saw its stock climb 16% following favorable comments from analysts. Mizuho started its coverage of Arcus with a buy rating and a price target of $22 per share. The stock analysis company is optimistic about Arcus' approach toward drug development, with an immune-based approach to fighting cancer that could generate enthusiasm. With more data from clinical trials expected over the course of the next year, now's a key time for Arcus to deliver on its promise to investors. Finally, Vail Resorts finished higher by 3% after having been up much more early in the session. The ski resort operator reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that closed a solid year for Vail, and early signs for the coming 2019-2020 winter season looked good. Season pass sales are well ahead of where they were this time last year both in units sold and in dollar revenue collected, and the closing of Vail's acquisition of Peak Resorts will add 17 new properties to the mix. Given how important a large network is in driving sales of its popular Epic Pass, Vail Resorts is in a great position to pick up speed down the slopes as winter approaches.

6,Bamboo Airways Plans $100 Million Initial Public Offering - Simple Flying,Bamboo Airways Plans $100 Million Initial Public Offering. Who are Bamboo Airways?. What is their new IPO?. Nicholas Cummins. Related," Bamboo Airways, the new favorite upstart airline from Vietnam, has already made plans to enter the stock market via an IPO despite launching less than a year ago. Bamboo Airways is a new airline in Vietnam that took off in January 2019. They operate 10 leased aircraft (one Airbus A319, five A320s, and four A321neos) with a huge order for more aircraft on the way (30 Boeing 787-9s, two A330-200s, and 46 A321neos). As reported by CH-Aviation, the airline also has four more A320-200s and the two A330s coming online before the end of this year. The airline focuses on flying holidaymakers from Vietnamese cities to remote resort destinations that are owned by the airline’s parent organization, as well as domestic travel throughout the country. However, looking at their order book for future aircraft, it is obvious that they have far bigger ambitions too. The airline wants to become the Vietnamese tourist airline of choice, even flying from Vietnam across to Europe and America. The airline was launched with capital from investors to the tune of $56 million USD, and thus to fund further expansion, the airline will need to go public to raise more than double that initial amount. According to an article published by Bloomberg, Bamboo Airways is ambitious enough to reach 30% market share (they believe they currently have 10% of Vietnam) by next year. This ambition needs funding, and doing a public offering will allow the airline to actually reach that level of capacity and seats across their network, let alone the international plans outlined above. “The fundraising will help us to expand our fleet as we want to take 30% of the domestic market next year,” Trinh Van Quyet, the Hanoi-based chairman of the startup carrier, said in a phone interview to Bloomberg.  Likely most of this new funding will go to pay for their airline orders, with the remainder to be used for cash flow. Once the initial public offering (IPO) is complete the airline plans to open the shares up for public trading on a stock exchange but has yet chosen any in particular. The airline has hopes to have 30 aircraft flying by the end of March 2020 and up to 100 aircraft by the end of the next five years in 2024, following permission from Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport in August for its adjusted operations.

This is the carrier’s largest deal since its merger with Northwest Airlines a decade ago. This pact with Latin America's largest carrier will strengthen Delta’s footprint in the region including cities in Argentina, Peru and Brazil, which are currently served by LATAM.

Delta aims to grow internationally by inking deals with foreign airlines. To this end, the carrier already has partnerships with Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., Air France-KLM, Korean Air Lines Co. and Grupo Aeromexico SAB. Lately, the carrier is said to be negotiating a 10% stake in Alitalia.

The Deal

As part of the partnership, the Atlanta, GA-based airline will also invest $350 million in aiding LATAM’s transition from Oneworld to join Delta’s network. The contract is also a step forward for Delta’s fleet transformation initiatives as the carrier will acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM and purchase 10 additional A350 aircraft (complying with LATAM’s commitment), which are to be delivered between 2020 and 2025, per the terms of the agreement. Further, Delta will get a representation on LATAM’s board.

The carrier anticipates the deal to be accretive to its earnings over the next two years. Moreover, this heavyweight contract is expected to boost revenues by $1 billion in five years. Additionally, Delta does not expect the transaction to affect its free cash flow and therefore its commitments to add shareholder value. The transaction is also not expected to weigh on its targeted leverage ratios. Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price   Delta Air Lines, Inc. price | Delta Air Lines, Inc. Quote   Following this new deal, the carrier plans to sell off its 9% stake in Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA GOL, which completes with LATAM.

As news of the deal broke, LATAM’s shares jumped more than 44% in after-hours trading on Sep 26. The company anticipates the transaction to enhance its capital structure and free cash flow as well as reduce its expected debt in excess of $2 billion by 2025.

Japan Airlines JAPSY, +0.92%   has a feature in its booking process that indicates where young children are seated on its flights. When passengers traveling with a child who is less than two years old select their seats, a child icon will appear on those seats when others go select their seats. It is not clear when Japan Airlines 9201, +1.10%  first rolled out this feature, but it was first widely noticed after Rahat Ahmed, a venture capitalist, tweeted about it. Japan Airlines did not immediately return a request for comment. There are some caveats to the child-icon feature that Japan Airlines noted on its website.

News Tips.","U.S.-China trade talks have hit another snag. The next chapter in the saga involves the Trump administration considering cutting back on investments in China, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC on Friday. Stocks fell in response, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding over 150 points. Monday on CNBC, in the first on-the-record comment about such considerations, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said the reports about them were “full of inaccuracies” and amounted to fake news. If the White House were to go through with that move, “it would be an unmitigated disaster,” says Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale University and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia. “Open access to each other’s markets [is] really important, especially with China likely to be the biggest consumer market in the world in the first half of this century,” he told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. Roach noted that the United States and China had been negotiating what’s known as a “bilateral investment treaty” for about 10 years before the trade war began in an effort to open “our markets to China and China’s markets to us.” “We got really close, but now it’s been stalled out,” Roach said. “We have bilateral investment treaties with 42 countries. China has them with 145. Free and open investment is the best way to enhance cross-border opportunities for multinational corporations, so we’re going the wrong way. This really would concern me if we were to make progress on it.” Roach isn’t the only one who’s concerned. A University of Michigan survey released Friday revealed that near-record numbers of consumers cited trade policy as a negative factor stymieing U.S. economic progress. And, when it comes down to it, the health of the U.S. consumer will be a major determinant in where the market goes next, Roach said. “With the global economy really weakening, recession likely in Europe, downside in Japan and throughout east Asia, the American consumer has really been the only thing that’s held the economy afloat,” he said. “But with businesses in the U.S. turning cautious on capital spending, these are the same businesses that make decisions on hiring, and if they pull the plug on job growth, then consumers are in trouble.” In short, “there’s not a lot of leeway should we get a soft patch,” according to the Yale professor, and that’s why U.S.-China trade talks stalling has Roach","Sep 28, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/28/us-pulling-investments-from-china-would-be-an-unmitigated-disaster.html

11,What are Model Portfolios? Are They Right For You? - SmartAsset,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .," Whether you’re a new or veteran investor, you probably want a lot of different things from an investment. But, deciding which investments will help you achieve your financial goals may be a bit of a challenge. So, rather than putting together a portfolio of investments from scratch, many financial advisors will assign you to a pre-built model portfolio. Here’s what to expect from a model portfolio and what to consider when selecting one.  Investment comes with expectations. Investors may seek high returns, low risk, tax efficiency and perhaps even social status. A financial advisor can assemble a model portfolio for investors and illustrate how it will achieve their goals. Model portfolios are a diversified group of assets designed to achieve an expected return with a corresponding risk. Ideally, each portfolio has a combination of managed investments based on extensive research. These portfolio blend asset classes, investment managers and investment strategies to achieve diversification. Typically, financial advisors or investment managers offer a variety of portfolios to correspond with your financial goals and objectives. Model portfolios allow investors to use simple and effective investment methods that require minimal management effort.  There are several advantages to investing in a model portfolio. Here are a few benefits you should consider when determining if this is the right investment choice for your financial goals and objectives. A model portfolio allows you to diversify your assets. Diversification is an investment strategy that helps investors reduce risk by distributing funds across multiple financial vehicles, asset categories and industries. To maximize returns while reducing risk exposure, financial advisors select investments that may react in different ways when the same event occurs. For instance, let’s say you decide to invest in railroad stocks. Then railroad workers go on strike and stock prices plummet. This scenario would cause your portfolio to take a severe hit. However, if you also invested in airline stocks, you may see an increase in share prices as people fly instead of taking trains. But, it could also have a negative impact on this stock because both are in the transportation industry. So, in an ideal scenario, you want to invest in a wide variety of securities in different industries to avoid a big loss when an event, such as our imagined railroad strike, occurs. Another advantage of investing in a model portfolio is that knowledgeable experts in the industry probably designed them.","Sep 27, 2019",https://smartasset.com/investing/model-portfolios
12,What Is EBITDA Measure And How It Affects Stocks,. . What Is EBITDA Measure And How It Effects Stocks. What is EBITDA?. EBITDA Calculated. Why is EBITDA Useful?.,"Chris Dios - September 27, 2019 EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It is a measure of a company’s financial health and earnings potential from core business operations. Its purpose is to give investors a better idea of how much a business earned from its actual business operations. Since interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are mostly unique events that have little to do with the underlying business, its often more useful to look at EBITDA numbers than overall net earnings. To calculate EBITDA, you need to know some basic information that you can find on just about any corporate income statement or balance sheet. This is the most simple way to calculate EBITDA: Alternatively, you can also use this method. However, it requires more data inputs: Whichever form you prefer, they both will take you to the same destination. Stripping out extraneous factors allows traders to see how the core business is operating. The downside is that is doesn’t speak for management. Core businesses can be performing well while companies decline due to poor management. Like any other data point, EBITDA is most effective when used in conjunction with other types of analysis. Traders can use it to help identify whether or not a core business is performing well. This form of earnings strips extraordinary expenses and allows for better baseline comparison of the underlying business model. Comparing stocks using EBITDA numbers allows traders to look at the companies in a more objective way because it compares actual underlying business operations. Traders frequently used this figure to measure corporate profitability, and it’s also used to estimate incoming cash flow and a company’s ability to cover its long-term debts.  Many traders prefer to use EBITDA when comparing different companies with sector benchmarks because they offer a more objective view of a company’s business. Discovering the information you need to perform this calculation is easy. You can find the required data in a company’s income statement under selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A). This category includes depreciation and amortization expenses. EBITDA helps interested parties evaluate similar companies in their respective business. Differences in companies’ accounting practices cause differences in net income earned. However, this is not to say that the company is a standout or a laggard. This information alone cannot tell investors how the company is doing relative to its peers.

This is typically caused by a decline in overall spending, which is often a result of one or more events such as a financial crisis or an economic bubble. Recessions are much more common than depressions, which are defined as a decline in GDP of more than 10%, or a recession that lasts more than two years. There have been 11 recessions since The Great Depression in 1929; there has been at least one recession every 10 years. Both depressions and recessions take a toll on the stock market, and as markets get more and more competitive and the economic environment changes, companies become more prone to bankruptcy and M&A. So what happened to the companies that were in the Dow 30 during The Great Depression? How about the Recession of 1958? The chart below shows what happened to the Dow 30 stocks during the five worst economic downturns since The Great Depression. Be sure to also read about the Complete History of the Original Dow Dozen. The Dow 30 includes some of the most significant and influential companies in the world. Due to the reliability and stability of these companies, many investors seek out Dow stocks to invest in. Below, we look at the performance of the current Dow 30 during the last five recessions. The 1970s recession began in November 1973 when gas prices skyrocketed after oil exports to the United States were stopped by OPEC. This would become known as the 1973 Oil Crisis. High government spending and a stock market crash in 1974 also added to this recession, which at the time was the worst economic downturn since The Great Depression. The stock market crash of 1974 was triggered by the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the Oil Crisis of 1973. The Dow lost 45% in value during this crash, making it the seventh worst bear market in history. United Technologies Corporation (UTX) and The Boeing Company (BA) were top performers during this recession, but the performance","Sep 27, 2019",https://www.dividend.com/dividend-education/the-dow-30-a-look-into-the-last-five-recessions/
14,How Did Carl Icahn Get Rich?,How Did Carl Icahn Get Rich?. . KEY TAKEAWAYS. The 1960s. The 1980s. 11. The 1990s. . The 2000s. Compete,"Carl Icahn made his fortune as a corporate raider by buying large stakes and manipulating the targeted company's decisions to increase its shareholder value. Most recently, on July 24, 2019, Icahn sent a letter critiquing Occidental Petroleum's management and board for issuing $10 billion of preferred stock to Berkshire Hathaway in late April. The stock carries an 8% dividend yield, and estimates suggest that Occidental could have issued preferred stock on the open market at a lower rate. Icahn, who holds a 4% stake in the company, is seeking to replace several directors. As of August 27, 2019, the activist investor's net worth was estimated by Forbes at close to $17.5 billion. This is his story. Charles Icahn spun through a degree in philosophy at Princeton and three years of medical school before he turned to Wall Street and became a broker and options manager for two different companies. In 1968, Icahn established his own brokerage firm, named Icahn & Co, a holding company that dabbled in options trading and risk, or merger, arbitrage. Corporate raiding, huge in the 1980s, tagged a certain notoriety. Raiders bought companies by acquiring large stakes in their corporations, achieved out-sized control, and used their shareholder rights to drastically manipulate the company's executive and leadership decisions. Raiders became hugely rich by increasing the value share of these companies through their interference. Icahn rationalized his raiding by saying it profited ordinary stockholders. Sometimes, he merged raiding with greenmailing, where he threatened to take over companies such as Marshall Field and Phillips Petroleum. These firms repurchased their shares at a premium to remove the threat. In 1985, Icahn bought Transworld Airlines (TWA) at a profit of $469 million and, as chairman, turned the firm around from bankruptcy. Carl Icahn was listed at #11 on the Forbes list of ""Highest-Earning Hedge Fund Managers 2019."" By the mid-1980s and through the 1990s, Icahn had amassed controlling positions in various companies that included Nabisco, Texaco, Blockbuster, USX, Marvel Comics, Revlon, Fairmont Hotels, Time Warner, Herbalife, Netflix, and Motorola. Each time, the billionaire sought to acquire, break up or sell off parts of the company. In 1991, Icahn sold TWA’s prized London routes to American Airlines for $445 million and forged an agreement with TWA, where Icahn could purchase any ticket through St. Louis for 55 cents on the dollar and resell at a discount. He plunged TWA into debt. Forbes","Sep 28, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/managing-wealth/080516/how-did-carl-icahn-get-rich.asp

Airbnb Stock Down 25% Since IPO, Three","An Airbus 320 operated by Spirit Airlines approaches for landing at Baltimore Washington ... [+] In his 2007 Chairman’s letter, Warren Buffett said that, in the airline industry, “a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.” The industry has evolved considerably since 2007, which is why Buffett has become an investor in the airline industry. Moreover, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) appears to be an up-and-coming carrier with a sustainable competitive advantage that is also trading at a very reasonable share price. The Airline Industry Evolution In 2007, when Buffett made his remarks, industry profitability was consistently terrible. At the time, eight different companies controlled 85% of industry capacity, and price wars which summarily destroyed profitability were a regular occurrence. Today, just four companies control 85% of industry capacity and, as a result, price wars are less frequent and less protracted. Most U.S. airline boards have begun linking management compensation to profit margins and returns on invested capital, and the majority of management teams have compensation packages linked to profitability. Moreover, it’s not just management teams that have pay tied to profits; employee profit-sharing programs have become very popular within the airline industry. As a result of these and other changes, airlines have improved their ability to match capacity with consumer demand and maintain high load factors during both peak and off-peak times, resulting in improved profits and better asset utilization. It is no wonder, then, that Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has become a top-two shareholder in all four of the largest airlines (United, Delta, American, and Southwest). Spirit Airlines – An Attractive Business Within the context of improving airline profitability, low-cost carriers, especially Spirit Airlines, have driven most of the industry growth in recent years. Spirit and other low-cost carriers have gained market share by stealing the legacy carriers’ cost-conscious passengers and attracting those who would have taken a different form of transport. Moreover, due to their extreme cost consciousness, these airlines are generally more profitable than the legacy airline companies. Indeed, Spirit Airlines has been generating a double-digit return on invested capital while also increasing revenues at a double-digit rate for years.  As the largest low-cost U.S. airline, Spirit enjoys a cost advantage which is so large that most","Sep 27, 2019",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamstrauss/2019/09/27/spirit-airlines-offers-cheap-airplane-tickets-along-with-a-cheap-share-price/

Some," According to head of Sanlam iTrade, Gerhard Lampen, more than 100 000 people in South Africa invest online in the stock market. Most are ‘ordinary people’ who have learnt how to invest for themselves. Remember that the stock market comes with risks; the outcome is never guaranteed.

17,Will Delta Benefit from Partnership with LATAM?,Will Delta Benefit from Partnership with LATAM?. Delta and LATAM partnership. Will the partnership impact American Airlines?. Financial benefits .,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO On Thursday, Delta Air Lines (DAL) announced a partnership with LATAM Airlines in a deal worth $2.25 billion. According to the agreement, Delta will acquire a 20% stake in LATAM for $1.9 billion. Also, the company will invest an additional $350 million to help LATAM transition out from Oneworld alliance and join Delta’s SkyTeam network. As part of the deal, Delta will purchase LATAM shares through a tender offer at $16 per share. The transaction would allow Delta to be on LATAM’s board of directors. Also, the airlines would acquire four long-haul and wide-body Airbus A350 aircraft. The partnership assumes that LATAM will fulfill its commitment to buy ten additional A350 planes. LATAM will receive the shipment between 2020 and 2025. Delta’s aggressive approach towards enhancing the South American network will help it compete with American Airlines (AAL) in the region. Notably, American Airlines has a strong presence on the continent through its partnership with LATAM Airlines. Currently, the airline has the highest number of fleets between the US and South America. As a result, we think that the Delta-LATAM partnership will disrupt American Airlines’ business operations in the Latin American region. The Delta and LATAM collaboration is the second major blow for American Airlines in the region this year. Earlier, the Chilean Supreme Court stopped American Airlines and LATAM Airlines for more route cooperation. The court’s ruling limited the upside benefits for the American Airlines and LATAM partnership. Due to LATAM’s new arrangements with Delta, American Airlines will likely lose its market share in the region. However, American Airlines denied that there’s a major financial impact from the Delta and LATAM collaboration. In a statement on Thursday, American Airlines said that “this change in partnership is not expected to have a significant financial impact to American, as the current relationship provided less than $20 million of incremental revenue to American, and the proposed joint business without Chile would have provided limited upside,” according to One Mile at a Time. Delta expects its investment in LATAM to increase its EPS over the next two years. The company expects the deal to bring in an additional $1 billion in revenues over five years. In a press release, Delta stated that the LATAM deal won’t impact its financial commitments to shareholders. LATAM Airlines expects the transaction to improve its capital structure by reducing its debt of $2 billion","Sep 27, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/09/will-delta-benefit-from-partnership-with-latam/
