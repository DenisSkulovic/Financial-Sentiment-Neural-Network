0,Tuesday's Rising Market Is Leaving Airline Stocks Behind | The Motley Fool,"Tuesday's Rising Market Is Leaving Airline Stocks Behind. There's a lot of optimism about the overall economy, but it won't","   Stocks were generally higher on Tuesday morning, with investors shrugging off concerns about the rise in reported COVID-19 cases in key states like Florida, Texas, and California. Instead, the focus appears to be on how quickly hard-hit Americans can get back to work and play their part in helping the overall economy return to more normal conditions. Just after 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up 176 points to 26,201. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) rose 25 points to 3,143, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) picked up 105 points to 10,162. Tuesday's gains were broad-based, but there were still some notable laggards that missed out on the rally. Airline stocks were among the worst performers, with a couple seeing greater losses than the rest. Even as the economy gets back on track, it's still unclear whether airlines will bounce back as much as other companies do. With airlines operating far below full capacity, raising capital in order to maintain financial reserves and offset negative cash flow has been essential. Unfortunately, it's been necessary to pull out all the stops in order to find viable funding sources, and that's weighing on shareholder confidence. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) announced the pricing that it received on its efforts to raise about $2 billion through offerings of stock and debt. American sold 74.1 million shares of stock to investors at a price of $13.50 per share, raising roughly $1 billion. The offering was larger than the originally anticipated $750 million, but it's hard to say that American's decision was motivated by strong demand, because the offering price turned out to be nearly 10% lower than where the shares closed Monday. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. In addition, American priced five-year convertible notes to pay a yield of 6.5%. That offering also got upsized from $750 million to $1 billion, with noteholders being able to convert their bonds to stock at a price of $16.20 per share. Overall, the two offerings prompted a quick 6% retreat for the stock Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) announced that its MileagePlus program subsidiary will raise $3 billion through an offering of seven-year notes. The mileage program will then turn around and lend the net proceeds to United. Terms of the offering haven't yet been set, but the news sent United shares down 3%. Elsewhere in the industry, losses were more modest.","Jun 23, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/23/tuesdays-rising-market-is-leaving-airline-stocks-b.aspx
1,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. Evidence is mounting that COVID-19 is regaining the upper hand in key tourism markets..,"   Airline shares are under pressure on Wednesday, caught in a broader market move downward due to growing fears that a surge in new COVID-19 cases will force another round of shutdowns. Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) were down 11% as of noon EDT, while shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were down 8% apiece. Shares of other carriers including American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) were all down 5% or more.  Airline balance sheets have been devastated by the pandemic, which has caused travel demand to evaporate and starved the industry of revenue. The shares have regained some of their altitude in recent weeks on growing hopes that the worst of the pandemic is now behind us, but that optimism is seemingly diminishing by the day. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Popular tourism destinations including California, Texas, Florida, and Arizona are seeing spikes in new cases, and some cities are considering reversing plans to reopen and instead putting new restrictions in place. That would threaten the nascent recovery, and in the worst case send demand back to March and April lows. Airlines saw daily business down 90% or more year over year in those months. Among the reports weighing on investor sentiment on Tuesday was a decision by the governors of New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey to impose travel restrictions on visitors from Florida and other high-infection states. Also, workers at Disney parks in Florida are reportedly petitioning to delay reopening due to the surge in new cases. Those headlines are all bearish for travel demand. The good news, if there is good news, is the airlines are not going to be caught flat-footed by a second wave. The industry has raised nearly $40 billion in private debt and equity capital in addition to up to $50 billion in government assistance. Just this week, both American and United have raised billions in additional liquidity. The goal for the airlines is to have enough cash in the bank to outlast the pandemic and its economic ramifications, no matter how long it takes. The industry has cut flights and is likely to start shedding workers this fall if demand does not return. But no airline can survive indefinitely without revenue coming in.

2,Buy American Airlines (AAL) Stock Now for a Long-Term Recovery | InvestorPlace,Buy American Airlines Stock Now for a Long-Term Recovery. Don't expect massive rallies in airline stocks to last until we," Most losses stem from obvious mistakes. Chasing a stock after a giant rally is an obvious mistake — it leaves investors vulnerable to disappointment. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) shot up, and many learned about this disappointment the hard way. AAL stock has fallen this week, but its problems started a long time ago.  Much of this drama started in early June, when experts started calling for a rally. Unfortunately, shares have fallen 40% from highs set on June 5. That was around the time when CNBC began focusing on Robinhood investors and their quick profits on airline stocks. But these bullish investors overstayed their welcome, and profits turned into losses. There are simple rules investor must be willing to follow, and there aren’t any real shortcuts. You must understand macroeconomics. Then, you must study a stock’s fundamentals. Compare companies to their competitors — in this instance, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL). Lastly, I am a strong believer in the charts, so I never make a trade without studying levels and patterns. Why do charts matter? Well, in an age where most trading is done by machines, the technical aspects ring truer than ever. Machines only trade based on history, and history is exactly what you see on the chart. Understanding the price history also means you can predict potential pitfalls. The big picture is terrible. Millions of U.S. residents are out of work, but the stock market doesn’t care. There’s even chatter of a second round of stimulus checks coming from the White House. Meanwhile, there is underlying weakness for American Airlines. The Transportation Security Administration traffic reports still show the daily airline throughput is down 78% year-over-year. This is hardly supportive of the bull case. Now that we have established that the environment is still hostile for airlines, we must look at what upside potential AAL stock has. I can report that, so far, it is packing its planes full. It could be worse. I know this because my wife just flew to and from Texas, and both of her flights had zero empty seats. Eventually, airlines will have to comply with new capacity rules. These rules will add to their burden. This sounds ominous, but it is important to thoroughly stress test every bullish thesis.  I promise you that I am not a hater. In fact, I shared a bullish write-up on March","Jun 24, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/06/american-airlines-aal-stock-buy-long-term-recovery/

4,Stocks to buy: These aerospace companies should bounce back from the COVID-19 crisis | Fortune,"Valuation: The coronavirus is crushing the aerospace industry, but these stocks should bounce back. The pandemic has set a precedent","June 24, 2020 9:00 PM GMT+3 “The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.”
—Warren Buffett, Fortune, 1999 When the stock market gyrates as wildly as it has this year, it doesn’t do any good to gyrate along with it. Much better to return to investing’s first principles, one of which I wrote about last month: Buy businesses that you wouldn’t mind owning if the stock market were closed for an extended period. This month, I want to explore an important corollary to this concept as seen through the prism of aerospace stocks, which I own a lot of on behalf of my clients: distinguishing between temporary losses and permanent ones.  Investors last got a good lesson in this subject more than a decade ago, when the financial crisis represented a reckoning for some businesses and a great buying opportunity for others. Heading into the 2008–09 financial crisis, for example, Wells Fargo was by far the best-capitalized and best-managed bank. Early in the crisis, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson called the major banks to Washington to offer them rescue packages; only Wells objected. “We don’t need your [expletive deleted] money,” then-CEO Dick Kovacevich reportedly told federal officials.  Wells was forced to take the funds, but mainly it used the crisis to get stronger, cutting expenses and doubling its low-cost asset base by buying Wachovia at a fire-sale price. Most of the other banks, however, weren’t as well prepared. Lehman Brothers went bust, Bear Stearns sold itself to JPMorgan Chase for cents on the dollar, and Citigroup had to raise so much new equity capital that even today, more than a decade after the crisis, a Citi share is worth roughly 10% of what it was before 2008.  The crisis laid bare banking cultures that were all too commonly characterized by loose lending standards and undisciplined expansion. I knew Wells didn’t have such a culture, so after its shares declined 40% in late 2008 I began to buy Wells stock for Gravity Partners and its clients. In the months that followed, the market didn’t agree with me: The stock fell another 20%, and then another 35%, and I was buying more all the way down.

Evidently, in the previous week, American Airlines AAL management stated that it hopes to reduce its cash-burn rate to nil by Dec 31, 2020. The carrier was also in news in the past five trading days when it announced its intention to raise $3.5 billion to strengthen its liquidity position to combat the coronavirus-induced low passenger revenues. Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines SAVE was fined by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to the tune of $350,000 for violating rules pertaining to oversold flights. Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Southwest Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), anticipates its June operating revenues to fall 70-75% year over year with capacity declining 40-50%. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) in the period is estimated in the 40-50% range. In May, operating revenues slumped 85-90% with capacity decreasing approximately 64% and load factor at around 30%. The May readings were better than those in April.

7,American Airlines Raises Nearly $2 Billion. This Is Why Its Stock Is Still Falling. | Barron's,American Airlines Raises Nearly $2 Billion. This Is Why Its Stock Is Still Falling.. . . Here’s BofA’s List of,"    American Airlines Group saw strong demand for its newly issued common stock and convertible securities, raising nearly $2 billion in capital. But American priced its common shares well below where the stock traded on Monday, and the stock is falling as investors factor in the equity dilution and hit to the balance sheet. American (ticker: AAL) said in a filing on Tuesday that it priced a $1 billion offering of 74.1 million shares of common shares at $13.50 and priced an offering of $1 billion in 6.5% convertible senior notes due in 2025. The proceeds amounted to $1.94 billion, which the airline said it would use for general purposes and to enhance its liquidity. Shares of American were down 6.8% Tuesday morning, at $13.90. The S&P 500 was up 0.9%, and the NYSE Arca Airline Index was off 1.1%. American’s capital raise was at the upper end of the carrier’s initial range, indicating strong demand. But the stock offering price of $13.50 was 9.6% below Monday’s closing price of $14.92, a sign that institutional investors needed a significant discount to be attracted to the shares. American has said it plans to raise a total of at least $3.5 billion through common equity, debt, and convertible offerings, implying that more security sales are on the way. American’s liquidity isn’t nearly as strong as its peers. Before the new capital raise, its liquidity amounted to $9.9 billion, or 22% of 2019 revenue, according to Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth. Delta Air Lines (DAL) has $19 billion in liquidity, or 41% of 2019 revenues, she estimates. United Airlines Holdings (UAL) is at 40% with $17.1 billion, and it’s likely to be enhanced by $5 billion this week as it issues more debt, using its mileage program as collateral in a deal with Goldman Sachs and other banks. Debt is rising throughout the industry, and American’s debt is a growing burden, expected to hit $38.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, putting its net debt to capital ratio at a steep 109%, according to Syth. American still has financial levers to pull: It has $7 billion in “unencumbered” assets such as planes that it can collateralize, and its loyalty program could be worth $19.5 billion to $31.5 billion, she estimates. That would be at least three times its market cap of $6.3 billion.

RNS Responses. Related","Stock Market Review for the Retail Investor  23 JUN 2020 | Patricia Miller  As countries start to lift travel restrictions and demand starts to creep back into the system, there are a few stocks which make better recovery plays than others.  And the near-total collapse of UK air travel through April and May has produced quite the interesting situation now.  A straw poll of friends revealed a stark split between ‘Get me on the first flight out of here,’ and ‘You couldn’t pay me enough to go to an airport right now.’  This kind of glass half full/empty dichotomy will infect the travel industry for a while yet.  But for the committed contrarian this period has been manna from heaven.  As the de facto creator of value investing Benjamin Graham said: “The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.” And optimism has been crushed.  Picking up pieces UK airline stocks looked utterly wrecked just a month ago. Ryanair (LSE:RYA) admitted a 99.5% drop in passenger numbers in May. British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG) revealed its fleet of planes was haemorrhaging cash at the rate of £178 million a week just parked on the ground.  That said, the numbers for anyone brave enough to take a punt at the peak of the pandemic crisis are clear to see.  A £5,000 Hail Mary on recently-demoted FTSE 250 budget airline easyjet (LSE:EZJ) in April would have yielded a 72% gain. That’s a healthy £3,600 profit and levels of growth normally reserved for the AIM casino.  AIM shares to soar Pre-pandemic, AIM-listed airline shares like Jet2 owner Dart Group (LSE:DTG) and Wizz Air (LSE:WIZZ) were among my favourites to trade.  Volume, momentum, and confidence were high. Between January and February, pre-crash and pre-lockdown (remember that?), each grew its share price by 10% and 25% respectively.  I still see these two as the best-placed travel stocks to come storming out of lockdown.  If I was going to buy any of these I’d buy Wizz Air. After shedding half its value in the Covid crash, it has regained a whopping 71%. Certainly the news out of Wizz Air has been much more positive than its older, larger rivals.

The most notable investor activity was by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which exited its positions in the four largest airlines: American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. Berkshire was the second-biggest holder of public companies in the airline sector at the end of 2019, with $10.19 billion in holdings. ""We took money out of the business, basically even at a substantial loss. And we will not fund a company ... where we think that it's going to chew up money in the future,"" Berkshire Chairman, President and CEO Warren Buffett said during the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, citing doubts on airline traffic over the next two to three years. The International Air Transport Association said June 9 that the global airline industry is headed for a collective net loss of $84.3 billion in 2020, its worst year ever as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out passenger demand. The industry group warned that airlines also face a ""financially fragile"" 2021 and that their recovery would be ""long and challenging"" amid elevated debt levels, changing travel patterns and a global recession. The Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index has lost nearly half its value since the end of 2019.  PRIMECAP Management Co., the leading institutional owner of airline companies at the end of 2019 in terms of market value, reduced its combined public holdings in 12 airlines to roughly 223.2 million shares as of June 17 from about 236 million shares as of Dec. 31, 2019, according to regulatory filings.

Here’s what happened: The economy should stage a “robust” growth spurt as 2020 progresses though that would be jeopardized by another widespread shutdown, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Wednesday. Even with the recent rise in cases for some states, Bullard said data show that the daily infections and in particular hospitalization and death rates have fallen substantially from the worst phase of the coronavirus pandemic in mid-April. With that, second-quarter growth is likely to be the worst in post-World War II history, but he thinks the U.S. is “going to be able to manage pretty well. My base case is we’ll have a pretty robust recovery in the second half of the year.” He added that people shouldn’t expect a Covid-19 vaccine soon and instead should focus on prevention and management measures. One area he cautioned against is taking the same approach going forward as the country did during the shutdown. “Depression would develop if we had many, many businesses closing up shop all at once, and that would take a long time to recovery from. So we definitely want to stay out of that situation,” Bullard said. “An important part of the depression risk that we face is [if] we get into that situation, we’ll have worse health outcomes and a worse economy. So it’s the worst of all worlds to be in that situation. We don’t want to be there.” – Cox Stocks tumbled on Wednesday as a slew of negative headlines about the spikes in new coronavirus cases damped hopes for a smooth economic recovery.

14,Forget Air Canada: Buy This TSX Growth Stock - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Forget Air Canada: Buy This TSX Growth Stock. Why you should choose,"      Daniel Da Costa | June 24, 2020 | More on: PLC During the last few months, there has been a tonne of interest in TSX stocks like Air Canada. This makes sense, as the stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value since the start of the pandemic. Because the stock is so cheap, savvy investors have been wondering if the stock is a buy at these low prices. However, soon after starting research, it should become apparent that it’s too difficult to make an investment. There is way too much uncertainty regarding how affected Air Canada will be. Also, there’s considerable uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic. Because of these uncertainties, even from a long-term perspective, it’s very difficult to have a good idea of the long-term potential of a company. Besides airline stocks, there are other industries, such as restaurants, hospitality, and retail, that have also been significantly affected. So, it’s not surprising that most stocks in these industries are also trading ultra-cheap. The airline industry is tough to be invested in, because it’s so heavily impacted by the coronavirus. Sure, restaurants have taken a big hit, and retail has seen a massive slowdown, but these will be able to rebound in some capacity, whereas airlines will be impacted for quite a while. Sitting inside an airplane is one of the highest-risk areas to contract the coronavirus, according to medical experts. Furthermore, countries are having a hard enough time containing coronavirus in their own borders, so we will likely continue to see border restrictions across the world. This will have a huge impact on travel until after this pandemic has come to an end. This means it could be years before airlines get back to the record capacity they saw in 2019. If you are interested in Air Canada because you think there could be big growth in the stock, you may be disappointed. Although this could easily materialize if there were positive news to act as a catalyst, at the moment, that seems unlikely. Instead, consider buying a TSX growth stock like Park Lawn (TSX:PLC). Park Lawn is in the death-care industry. The company owns funeral homes, crematoriums, cemeteries, and other businesses in its diverse portfolio. Park Lawn is growing in three ways.

17,American Airlines braces balance sheet with $3.5 billion in financing | The Japan Times,TOKYO (5 p.m.). BUSINESS / CORPORATE. American Airlines braces balance sheet with $3.5 billion in financing. PHOTO GALLERY (CLICK TO,"8 P/SUNNY  BLOOMBERG NEW YORK – American Airlines Group Inc. dropped after the carrier said it would raise $3.5 billion (¥375 billion) in new financing, diverging from its recent reliance on U.S. federal aid as the coronavirus pandemic suppresses travel demand. The carrier is selling $750 million of shares and the same amount of senior convertible notes due in 2025, American said in a statement Sunday. In addition, the carrier will offer $1.5 billion in senior secured notes and said it would enter into a $500 million term loan facility.   American’s actions show the broad range of tools airlines are using to bolster balance sheets amid a hesitant return to flying that for now is led largely by leisure travelers anxious to escape months of confinement. While carriers have resumed some of the U.S. domestic flights slashed when the virus hurt travel demand in late March, a full recovery is expected to take years. The largest U.S. carriers continue to burn through as much as $45 million daily as demand sags. With the equity offering, Texas-based American joins Southwest Airlines Co., which raised about $4 billion with an April sale of 70 million shares and $2 billion in convertible notes due in 2025. United Airlines Holdings Inc. raised more than $1 billion in the industry’s first share sale during the coronavirus crisis. American used a pool of slots, gates and routes in various countries, including the U.S., China, Japan, Australia and South America as collateral for the bonds and term loan. The stock offering is to start trading Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Part of the proceeds from the offering and loan will be used to refinance a $1 billion, 364-day financing the airline took out on March 18. The new $500 million loan, which will close with the bond offering, is due in 2024. American will grant underwriters up to $112.5 million worth of additional shares and the same amount in added convertible notes depending on demand, the carrier said. Carriers are pulling out all the stops to make sure they’re positioned for a fundamental change in their business. Delta Air Lines Inc. is preparing for a “slow and choppy” recovery that could take as long as three years to return “to a new level of normal,” the carrier said in a June 19 presentation.
