0,Warren Buffett: Sell All Airline Stocks Now!,. . Warren Buffett: Sell All Airline Stocks Now!. History is revealing. What does Buffett think now?. MORE FROM THE,"Everyone knows Warren Buffett. He’s one of the greatest investors in history. When he talks, markets listen. If you’re invested in airline stocks, pay attention. Buffett’s relationship with the airline industry stretches back decades. Everything culminated in 2017 when he started buying shares. Last year, he was a major shareholder of four different airlines.  Then the coronavirus hit. The airline industry experienced the sharpest decline in passenger traffic ever. Uncertainty remains rampant. What does Buffett have to say about the current situation? Let’s find out. If you want to understand how Buffett thinks about the airline industry, it’s critical that you review his past statements. “If a far-sighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting Orville down,” he claimed over a decade ago, later adding that “there have been almost 100 airline bankruptcies” since the industry first began. “I mean, that is a lot. It’s been a disaster for capital.” People change. In 2017, Buffett explained his new airline bets, saying that this time actually was different. “It’s true that the airlines had a bad twentieth century,” he said. “They’re like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way. The hope is they will keep orders in reasonable relationship to potential demand.” Perhaps he should have listened to his previous statement on the matter: “I now have an 800 number I call every time I think about buying a stock in an airline. I say, ‘I’m Warren and I am an air-aholic.’” Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Buffett’s airline profits were completely erased. In March, when the pandemic first began, Buffett was steadfast in his support for the industry.

1,LUV Stock: Southwest Remains a Clear Winner As Travel Recovers | InvestorPlace,"Southwest Airlines Stock Remains a Clear Winner As Travel Recovers. Airline stocks are starting to recover, and LUV stock is"," We may still have a long way to go before the novel coronavirus pandemic is no longer an issue. But, the recovery has already started for hard-hit names like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock. After hitting multi-year lows due to outbreak-driven depressed air traffic, shares have bounced back more than 50%.  And that’s no surprise. Since mid-May, the airlines have started clawing their way back towards pre-pandemic air traffic levels. Granted, a look at TSA checkpoint travel numbers still shows travel levels remain far blow where they were a year back. However, things are moving in the right direction. And, given public sentiment remains largely pessimistic, coronavirus tailwinds remain more than priced into airline stocks. Yet, if the pandemic cools down sooner than expected, names in the sector stand to make substantial additional gains. And, it’s low-cost airlines like LUV stock that stand to gain the most. How so? With a stronger balance sheet than its legacy rivals, Southwest is in a much better place financially. Also, the carrier is projected to recoup a much larger share of its pre-pandemic revenue than the three “old school” major airlines. To top it all off, the carrier could leverage these strengths to gain substantial market share while rivals struggle to bounce back. In short, Southwest remains one of the best airline stocks out there, and a buy as it makes a recovery. Granted, a sooner-than-expected comeback for air travel bodes well for airline stocks across-the-board. But, there are many reasons why low-cost carriers like Southwest remain airline comeback plays. Firstly, Southwest is in a stronger place financially. Yes, like the other major airlines, this carrier has experienced tremendous cash burn, as well as borrowed billions under the U.S. Government’s CARES Act to shore up its balance sheet. Yet, in terms of liquidity, the carrier can outlast many of its rivals. As announced back in June, Southwest has enough cash to carry on for nearly two years. Secondly, this airline is second to only another favorite of mine, Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) in terms of potential recovery speed. What do I mean? As I discussed earlier this month, Spirit and Southwest are the only carriers projected to recover more than 75% of their 2019 revenue in 2021. Compare that to all three legacy carriers. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) all have 2021 revenue projections that are below 65%","Aug 13, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/luv-stock-southwest-remains-a-clear-winner-as-travel-recovers/
2,2 Ways to Play AAL Stock While It Takes Flight Again | InvestorPlace,How to Play American Airlines Stock As It Takes Flight Again. AAL stock finally broke out of its trading range.," Airline stocks are finally taking flight. Their departure has been a long-time coming. For weeks, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and its peers have been parked on the tarmac, fueled up, and ready to go. What they lacked was a catalyst — a reason for buyers to return to the industry. Bulls were too busy chasing tech stocks to the moon, and sentiment surrounding the reopening trade had soured. But patience has finally paid off in AAL stock.  We could point toward multiple factors for the takeoff, but I think the most important variable is the capital influx into small-cap stocks. When you look at stock performance through the lens of market capitalization, it reveals where the masses are moving their money. In turn, we can conclude sentiment and risk appetite. The go-to benchmark for small-cap stocks is the Russell 2000 Index. In June, its recovery stalled out, and for almost two entire months the Index meandered. Traders left its shores in search of bigger gains elsewhere. Airliners like AAL stock were among the tickers being left to languish. The money fleeing the little guys found a new home in the protective arms of large-cap tech stocks. As a result of the steady drumbeat into the big boys, the Nasdaq notched record highs virtually every single week. As we’ll see in the chart for the AMEX Airline Index below, during this period of indifference toward the little guys, airline stocks drifted.  Without the lift of small-cap strength, AAL stock was unable to leave the ground. Fortunately, we finally saw rotation over the past week. With the tech sector in the stratosphere, traders decided to ring the register and shift capital into small-caps. With the RUT once again powering higher, bullish momentum has been restored to airlines. The fact that casinos and hotels have been hopping as well tells us that the reopening trade is making a comeback. Since pivoting on Aug. 3, the Airline Index has risen for five of the past six trading sessions, gaining nearly 20%. The rally allowed XAL to push above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages. While it’s true that moving averages are rendered mostly useless in a range, rising above them is a prerequisite to starting a sustainable uptrend. The upper end of the consolidation zone has been defined by $57.50. Tuesday’s jump finally carried us beyond it, signaling an upside breakout that","Aug 12, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/american-airlines-aal-stock-is-taking-flight/
3,Airline ETF Takes Off: Will The Surge Continue?,. . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD.,"                                                   Airline stocks have bounced back strongly this week on a rebound in travel demand. This is especially true as the number of people going through airport security screening checkpoints hit a five-month high last weekend. Nearly 832,000 people screened across the country on Aug 9, up from 799,861 the week before per the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data.

This is the first time that passenger numbers topped 800,000 since Mar 17, when the coronavirus pandemic hit passenger numbers. However, the new daily record number is down 70% over the same day in 2019 when about 2.5 million people were screened.

Given this, U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, the only ETF dedicated to the airline industry, surged 13% over the past six sessions, representing the longest such streak since the eight-day stretch ended Mar 13, 2018 (read: Best & Worst ETF Areas of July). This fund provides exposure to the global airline industry, including airline operators and manufacturers from all over the world, by tracking the U.S. Global Jets Index. In total, the product holds 40 securities with the highest concentration on the top four largest U.S. carriers, which collectively make up for nearly 38.3%. American firms account for 68.4% of assets while Canada, Mexico, China and the United Kingdom round off the next countries. The fund has gathered $1.3 billion in its asset base while sees a solid trading volume of nearly 5.9 million shares a day. It charges investors 60 bps in annual fees (see: all the Industrial ETFs here). Despite the jump, the airline ETF is down about 44% this year. The resurgence in coronavirus infections across several states including Florida, California and Texas, once again put travelers off flying. For the last few weeks, passenger numbers have plateaued at around 20-25% of the pre-COVID-19 levels.

As such, air travel has a long way to go before reaching the levels seen before the pandemic. According to International Air Transport Association (IATA), the second half’s recovery in traffic has been slower than expected as global passenger traffic will not return to pre-crisis levels until 2024, a year later than previously projected","Aug 12, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-etf-takes-off-surge-140502550.html

BTC-USD.,"                                                   In the past week, Copa Holdings CPA reported a loss in second-quarter 2020 results, keeping the overall bearish sentiment alive. This underperformance was due to weak passenger revenues as a result of sagging air-travel demand, which stemmed from the coronavirus pandemic. Notably, carriers like SkyWest SKYW and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL also disappointed investors when it released second-quarter earnings in the previous week On the non- earnings front, the likes of Azul AZUL, Gol Linhas and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT posted their respective traffic results for July. Despite the recent slight improvement in demand, passenger revenues are way below the year-ago figures. Consequently, traffic decreased significantly on a year-over-year basis. 1.    Copa Holdings, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), incurred a loss (excluding $6.38 from non-recurring items) of $2.7 per share in second-quarter 2020, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.38. Meanwhile in the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.2 per share.  Quarterly revenues of $14.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.4 million. However, the top line plunged 97.7% year over year with passenger revenues tumbling 98.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2.    Due to coronavirus-induced bleak air-travel demand, Gol Linhas’ traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), slumped 80.2% year over year in July. With travel demand way below year-ago levels, the company reduced capacity significantly. For July, capacity measured in available seat miles contracted 78.5%. With travel demand lagging the year-ago levels, the company reduced capacity significantly. For July, capacity, measured in available seat miles, contracted 78.5%. With traffic declining more than the extent of capacity contraction, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) fell to 78.1% from 84.7% a year ago. Gol Linhas’ total monthly departures tanked 78%.

3. At Allegiant Travel, July traffic for scheduled service dropped 48.2% on a year-over-year basis. Scheduled capacity fell 9.8% to 1516.8 million in the month.

8,Warren Buffett Is Wrong! Airlines Will Bounce Back - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Warren Buffett Is Wrong! Airlines Will Bounce Back. Evidence. Valuation. Warren Buffett’s,"      Vishesh Raisinghani | August 13, 2020 | More on: AC All signs seem to indicate that Warren Buffett has abandoned the airline industry. He recently sold his investments in America’s four largest airlines at a steep loss. Buffett’s abrupt change of heart served as a red flag for Canada’s airline industry as well. Air Canada (TSX:AC), for example, has lost 27.5% of its value since June.  I have nothing but respect for the Oracle of Omaha. After all, you don’t become one of the wealthiest investors on the planet without being right more often than you’re wrong. However, on this decision, I disagree with him. Here are three reasons I believe Buffett made a mistake and why airlines like Air Canada could rebound in the years ahead.  Air Canada has cut several routes this year. This decision was driven by a collapse in domestic air travel demand and border restrictions that have stymied international travel. In other words, barely anyone is flying right now.  However, the number of domestic air passengers has slowly bounced back from its March-April lows. As the number of coronavirus cases subside across the country, people are traveling to domestic destinations for summer vacations.  International travel is also gradually opening up, with several countries in the European Union and Asia accepting Canadian tourists this year. Japan, Iceland, and Greece are even subsidizing foriegn visitors.  Meanwhile, domestic air travel in the U.S. has more than doubled from 87,000 in April to over 200,000 in May, 2020. That could indicate that the worst is over for the airlines. While borders were being shut, and the economy was being locked down, Air Canada was restructuring its operations to lower costs and boost cash. The company has raised $1.6 billion by offering new shares and raising debt funding in June. Meanwhile, the airline has sold 79 planes, laid off 20,000 employees, and announced a cost-savings initiative of $1 billion. The stock now trades at a price-to-book value ratio of 2.5 and a price-to-sales ratio of 0.36. In other words, the company has bolstered its business, but the stock price still reflects the worst-case scenario. Air Canada seems to have enough cash to survive for years, as air travel gradually recovers and the world mitigates the virus’s impact.  To be fair, Buffett’s investment strategy has always focused on predictability.","Aug 13, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/08/13/warren-buffett-is-wrong-airlines-will-bounce-back/

And more Big hedge funds such as Citadel, Sandbar Asset Management and Marshall Wace homed in on the tourism industry to take short positions, filings show. The hedge funds declined to comment. Calculations by data provider Ortex Analytics showed short sellers earned 853.6 million euros ($1.01 billion) in the first seven months of the year, up from 174.1 million euros over the same period in 2019 from shorting tourism related stocks. Hedge funds profit when they borrow a stock from an institutional investor and sell it back when the price falls, pocketing the difference, a practice known as short-selling. Airline Deutsche Lufthansa proved one of the most profitable, making short-sellers more than 150.3 million euros in profit over the period, according to the Ortex data. Other heavily shorted stocks were French hotel company Accor , TUI and cruise line Carnival Corp, based on Ortex data. Some hedge funds ramped up short positions during strict lockdowns between March and May, before easing them as Europe seemed to become successful at reducing infections.

Airline stocks like International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), easyJet and Ryanair have all rallied more than 18% in August, with the trio benefitting from a strong recovery in short-haul flights and have adjusted operations to accommodate passengers amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But with European governments considering travel bans and quarantines to stop a resurgence in coronavirus cases, the airline industry remains in a precarious position. But will the three airlines share prices keep climbing or will headwinds prove too much for the sector?

12,IndiGo shares up 19% this week; here’s why the stock is surging while airlines have their wings clipped - The Financial Express,IndiGo shares up 19% this week; here’s why the stock is surging while airlines have their wings clipped. IndiGo’s recent,"India’s largest domestic carrier IndiGo’s share price jumped over 8% on Thursday, taking it 19% higher so far this week. Although the aviation industry has been one of the worst hit by the coronavirus, IndiGo still remains a preferred pick for a number of market analysts. Passenger traffic has now inched higher with average daily flyers reaching 80,000 per day in the previous week. IndiGo’s recent decision to raise funds has helped instill confidence in investors pushing the stock higher to trade at Rs 1,120 per share. IndiGo’s stock price has gained 31% since March, but still remains way below its February highs. In-line with a number of firms, IndiGo too has announced that it will raise Rs 4,000 crore through issue of equity shares through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). Fundraising seems important for IndiGo after the airline reported a 92% fall in revenue in the first quarter of this year. The largest private carrier reported a net loss of Rs 2,844 crore crore in the April-June quarter with revenue shrinking to just Rs 1,143 crore. Earlier last month IndiGo said that the company was operating 400 flights daily. Further, IndiGo has seen buying interest from Jwalamukhi Investment Holdings, a private investment arm of Westbridge Capital. Jwalamukhi Investment bought 54 lakh shares of the aviation giant from Kotak Mahindra International Ltd for Rs 1,028 per share.  “IndiGo is best placed among Indian carriers to withstand the current disruption and also capitalize on growth recovery,” said analysts at Centrum Broking. IndiGo has a domestic market share of over 52% which makes it a favoured pick among the listed private airline carriers. IndiGo has also been vigilant in taking on cost cutting measures so that the company is able to fly whenever the skies open back to their original strength. Aviation analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher has last month noted that IndiGo’s strong balance sheet with Rs  18,400 crore in cash and cash equivalents along with industry leading cost structure and strong management team could help it fare better than peers. IndiGo’s share price has surpassed most of the target prices of brokerage firms after its recent surge.
