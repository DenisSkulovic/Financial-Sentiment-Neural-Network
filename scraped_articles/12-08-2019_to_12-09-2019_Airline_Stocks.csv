1,Morgan Stanley: Buy Virgin Galactic stock on hypersonic opportunity,"Virgin Galactic shares to triple as it disrupts airlines with hypersonic travel, Morgan Stanley says. Shares to triple?. First space","Morgan Stanley began coverage of Virgin Galactic’s stock on Monday with an overweight rating, saying the space tourism company’s shares will soar as it proves out a long-term plan of flying people around the world at hypersonic speeds. “A viable space tourism business is what you pay for today … but a chance to disrupt the multi-trillion-dollar airline [total addressable market] is what is really likely to drive the upside,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to investors. Virgin Galactic shares rose 16% in trading to close at $8.42. That was its best day of trading since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 28, although the stock remains about 35% below its most recent high. Morgan Stanley’s price target of $22 a share represents a 203% increase from Virgin Galactic’s current levels. The company outlined a three phase plan to investors during its roadshow earlier this year. While Morgan Stanley gave a $10 a share valuation to Virgin Galactic’s space tourism business, phases one and two of its plan, the firm sees $12 a share in value from phase three: Hypersonic point-to-point air travel. “The shares feature biotech-type risk/reward where today’s space tourism business serves as a funding strategy and innovation catalyst to incubate enabling tech for the hypersonic P2P (point-to-point) air travel opportunity,” Jonas said. Jonas, known on Wall Street for his early calls on Tesla, has recently been also looking at the fast-growing space industry. Morgan Stanley forecast $800 billion in annual sales for hypersonic travel by 2040, or just about two decades from now. Virgin Galactic is in the early stages of exploring how the technologies it developed for space tourism might apply to hypersonic travel, with Boeing venture arm HorizonX recently investing $20 million into Sir Richard Branson’s company specifically to explore hypersonics. “While some investors have described high-speed hypersonic P2P air travel opportunity as ‘the icing on the cake’, we see Hypersonic as both the cake and the icing, with Space Tourism as the oven,” Jonas said. The firm is the third on Wall Street to begin covering Virgin Galactic’s stock. Credit Suisse and Vertical Research Partners also have buy ratings. Virgin Galactic expects to begin flying its first space tourism customers in the next six to nine months.

2,"Tesla is a 'faith stock,' according to trader","Here’s why Tesla is a ‘faith stock,’ according to trader. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","Tesla shares are tapping the accelerator again. The electric automaker’s stock has added 2% so far this month, better than the slight decline by the Nasdaq 100. Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global, says its status as a “faith stock” could mean a bigger move is ahead. “Tesla is definitely a faith stock and many investors in Tesla are really, really looking at the real long-term vision of this and willing to seemingly suffer a lot of pullbacks that happen in the interim and it causes the stock to develop an incredible momentum when it starts to run,” Sanchez said Friday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” Tesla has had a major run over the past three months, reversing its late spring and early summer slump. The stock is up nearly 50% since early September. Even so, Sanchez said it could be at risk of coming back down to earth. “Remember, three months ago we were worried about production, six months ago we worried about production, this company still has issues, and when it overshoots like this, it naturally will come back,” Sanchez said. “No matter how bullish the story, it still has to block and tackle and meet all of the interim requirements in order to maintain that bull story.” Morgan Stanley analysts upped their bull case price target to $500 last week on potential Cybertruck sales and growth into China. A move to that level would mark a 48% rally from current levels. JC O’Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, said Tesla investors should get used to these wild moves in the shares. “This stock is extremely susceptible to these large momentum swings. Just look back at last June. The stock was cut in half, it was on multiyear support at $185. Since then the stock doubled, but now it’s overbought and at resistance in that $365-$380 area,” O’Hara said during the same segment.  However, after its autumn rally, O’Hara warns that it could be building toward a breakdown. “You know an overbought stock at resistance,” said O’Hara. “I would rather exercise some patience. Wait for a pullback, and I think that’ll be a better tactical buying opportunity.” Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

4,Virgin Galactic Could Disrupt Airline Industry With Hypersonic Travel: Analyst | Investor's Business Daily,Why This Boeing-Backed Space Stock May Be A Threat To Airlines. Hypersonic Point-To-Point Travel Disrupting Airlines. Virgin Galactic's Space Tourism.,"BREAKING: Futures Rise On Big Gains For Nike, Banks    Virgin Galactic (SPCE) was started with an overweight rating at Morgan Stanley Monday as analysts bet the Boeing (BA)-backed space company's future high-speed, point-to-point air travel could disrupt the airline industry. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas started Virgin Galactic stock with a 22 price target. He compared the space tourism company to a biotech in terms of risk/reward. Jonas wrote that Virgin's space tourism side of the business is a ""niche"" market buoyed by those with yachts and luxury cars. But its hypersonic point-to-point travel plan is ""really likely to drive the upside."" ""While some investors have described high-speed hypersonic P2P air travel opportunity as 'the icing on the cake', we see Hypersonic as both the cake and the icing, with Space Tourism as the oven,"" he wrote. But Jonas warned that there were still unknowns and risks associated with Virgin Galactic, including fatal accidents, regulatory obstacles, competition and limited market acceptance. Shares jumped 16% to 8.42 on the stock market today. But Virgin Galactic stock remains well under its 50- and 200-day lines, according to MarketSmith analysis. Boeing stock dipped 0.8%, also below its key support levels. American Airlines (AAL) was off 0.85%, while United Airlines (UAL) was down 1.1%. Boeing venture capital arm HorizonX took a $20 million minority stake in Virgin to help Richard Branson's company develop a vehicle to travel Earth at hypersonic speeds. Virgin said earlier this year that a business jet takes 11 hours to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo. But a hypersonic vehicle traveling at five times the speed of sound could make the same journey in just two hours. But Virgin Galactic also has competition from other space companies looking at point-to-point travel. Elon Musk's SpaceX said its Starship will take passengers into low Earth orbit on the way to their destinations, potentially cutting travel time from London to Dubai from 7 hours to just 29 minutes. On Oct. 28, Virgin Galactic became the first publicly traded commercial space tourism company after a reverse merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings. As of Sept. 30, it has received reservations from over 600 people in 60 countries, accounting for $80 million in deposits and $120 million in potential revenue. Virgin also had 3,557 expressions of interest in flight reservations by the end of Q3.

5,United Airlines Buys the Airbus A321XLR: Is Boeing's NMA Dead? | The Motley Fool,United Airlines Buys the Airbus A321XLR: Is Boeing's NMA Dead?. As more airlines pick the Airbus A321XLR to serve long-and-thin,"   Today, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) operate hundreds of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 757 and Boeing 767 jets, with transatlantic flights being the most prominent use case. However, these planes are aging, leading to lots of speculation about how the three legacy carriers would replace them. Until recently, there were no direct replacements available for either model. The Boeing 737 MAX 10 and Airbus (OTC:EADSY) A321neo are similar in size to the 757-200 but don't have enough range for most transatlantic routes. Even the smallest Boeing 787 Dreamliner variant is larger than the most popular 767 model (the 767-300ER). The Dreamliner also has far more range than is needed for transatlantic routes, adding unnecessary costs. However, Airbus began selling an ultra-long-range version of the A321neo earlier this year: the A321XLR. It has been racking up orders quickly. Last week, United Airlines jumped on the bandwagon, ordering 50 Airbus A321XLRs. This could be the final nail in the coffin for Boeing's proposed ""NMA"" (new midsize airplane) concept, which would have filled a similar niche. UNITED AIRLINES ORDERED 50 AIRBUS A321XLRS LAST WEEK. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. The Airbus A321XLR has an advertised range of 4,700 nautical miles -- even more than the Boeing 757. It's also about 30% more fuel efficient. As a result, it represents a great direct replacement and can also open the door to new routes that were slightly too long for the Boeing 757 or wouldn't have been sufficiently profitable with the 757's higher fuel burn. Unsurprisingly, Airbus quickly won commitments for the A321XLR from three U.S. airlines after launching the model at the 2019 Paris Air Show. Most notably, American Airlines ordered 50. It will likely use them for flights to Hawaii from Los Angeles and Phoenix, as well as transatlantic flights from Philadelphia (and perhaps also Chicago and New York). Many of these routes are operated with Boeing 757s today, or were in the past. Airbus also received smaller order commitments from two U.S. low-fare carriers. JetBlue Airways converted 13 A321neo orders to the A321XLR, as part of its plan to begin flying from Boston and New York to Europe. Finally, Frontier Airlines ordered 18, although its A321XLR plans are less clear. United Airlines (and merger partner Continental Airlines before that) has been the biggest user of the 757 for transatlantic routes, mainly connecting Newark Airport to smaller","Dec 8, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/08/united-airlines-buys-the-airbus-a321xlr-is-boeings.aspx
6,Virgin Galactic leaps after Morgan Stanley says the company's stock can jump 203% over the next year | Markets Insider,. Virgin Galactic leaps after Morgan Stanley says the company's stock can jump 203% over the next year. SHARE THIS,"   REUTERS/Luke MacGregor  Virgin Galactic traded as much as 21% higher Monday after Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on the stock with a buy-equivalent rating and forecasted dominance in the hypersonic-flight business.  Morgan Stanley also issued a $22 price target for the stock, saying the company offers ""biotech-type risk/reward"" and has the potential to ""disrupt the multi-trillion-dollar airline"" industry. The aerospace company closed last week at $7.26 per share, leading the bank's note to imply a 203% surge through December 2020. Virgin Galactic's space-tourism business is only worth $10 per share, the team of analysts led by Adam Jonas said Monday, and the greater investment opportunity comes from hypersonic point-to-point travel.  The team split Virgin Galactic's future into three phases. The first two involve 90-minute space trips for wealthy consumers and, subsequently, an expanded space-tourism business involving more than 3,000 passengers by the end of the next decade. The third phase of the firm's business model includes hypersonic travel, with $800 billion in annual sales arriving by 2040, according to MS. The futuristic transport opportunity drives $12 per share in the bank's price target. Sending a customer to space and back safely is ""the key catalyst"" to driving a hypersonic travel industry, the analysts said, and those who believe space tourism is the most promising opportunity are mistaken. ""While some investors have described high-speed hypersonic P2P travel air travel opportunity as 'the icing on the cake,' we see Hypersonic as the cake and the icing, with Space Tourism as the oven,"" the analysts wrote. The bank's analyst pointed out a trove of risks facing the company as it seeks to enter a new and relatively unexplored sector. Virgin Galactic is ""possibly one passenger fatality away"" from strict regulatory scrutiny, they said, mentioning Boeing's 737 MAX controversy. The company may face difficulty in making a case for space tourism, they added. Though the population of millionaires is rising, Virgin Galactic's future relies on fundraising from its tourism business. Should the company find demand to be far weaker than anticipated, a lucrative hypersonic travel business may never leave the ground, MS wrote.  Virgin Galactic traded at $8.61 per share at 2:33 p.m. ET Monday, down roughly 15% year-to-date. The company has three ""buy"" ratings, no ""hold"" ratings, and no ""sell"" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $19.11, according to Bloomberg data and the Morgan","Dec 9, 2019",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/virgin-galactic-stock-price-spikes-morgan-stanley-lofty-price-target-2019-12-1028748656
7,Virgin Galactic stock soars on bullish Morgan Stanley note,Fast Company. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"      Now you know what to buy your 2040 self for the holidays: some shares of Virgin Galactic to hold for a long, long time. Virgin Galactic’s stock soared 18% today following a bullish rating by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who predicts that the company will eventually disrupt the multitrillion-dollar airline industry if its hypersonic air travel plans come to fruition. That’s a big if. Virgin Galactic is currently a space tourism company in phase one of a three-part strategy. Hypersonic point-to-point air travel is not expected to arrive until the third phase, and in the meantime the company must develop hypersonic air travel technology while expanding its space tourism business. A proof of concept does not yet exist. “We believe the key catalyst over the next 12 months will be sending even one customer to space and returning safely,” Jonas wrote. Traders were undeterred, boosting Virgin Galactic’s stock, which has been down as much as 40% since October. Jonas’s investor notes attract attention around Wall Street, following his accurate forecasts on stocks like Tesla. Today he gives Virgin Galactic stock a price target of $22 a share (it’s currently trading above $8) and predicts that hypersonic air travel will be a $800 billion market in 20 years. Other analysts have recently rated Virgin Galactic stock a “buy,” though they focused on its space tourism business.

Two days earlier, on December 7, United Airlines, the third largest carrier in the world, started non-stop services between Delhi and San Francisco. Later that day, VietJet Air - Vietnam's low cost airline - launched first direct flight between Hanoi and New Delhi. The end of the year will also see Delta Air Lines, another American aviation major, restart its non-stop flight between Mumbai and New York after a decade.

By: Josiah Wilmoth | Email | Leave a comment The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned south on Monday, slipping below the 28,000 level due to weakness in several core stocks. Here are five reasons why the Dow struggled – and failed – to sustain the momentum from last Friday’s massive rally. Boeing is the Dow’s most heavily weighted component, which is bad news since the aerospace giant spent the day ranked among the index’s worst performers. Investors appeared to be reacting to reports that the Federal Aviation Administration had smacked Boeing with a proposed $3.9 million penalty. Regulators allege that the company installed defective parts in about 130 737 NG-model aircraft and still certified them as airworthy – even after learning about the defective parts. While the amount of the fine is immaterial to the $200 billion Dow Jones stock, it’s not a good look for a company that needs to stay on the FAA’s good side if it hopes to see its cash cow – the 737 MAX – given the green light to return to service. Other core Dow stocks struggled, too. Shares in Apple, the DJIA’s third-heaviest stock, fell by just under 2%, making it far and away the index’s worst performer. Goldman Sachs, the Dow’s fourth-heaviest stock, declined by 1%. AAPL shares had surged to all-time highs on Friday after an industry analyst predicted that the iPhone","Dec 9, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/5-reasons-why-the-dow-slipped-below-28000-today/
13,Top Consumer Discretionary Stocks | Consumer Discretionary ETF,. . Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks - Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy Now. Top Consumer Discretionary Companies in the World.,"  Consumer discretionary stocks are issued by companies in the business of goods and services that are non-essentials. These non-essentials—such as entertainment, fashionable apparel, and automobiles—are available for purchase by consumers with disposable income (or a credit card). These are the companies that have made a name for themselves in the consumer discretionary sector, showing long-term solid performance on the stock market. Through quality products, stellar brand building, and customer loyalty, they’ve become household names around the world for what they offer, whether it’s animated entertainment, travel and vacations, or vehicles. The consumer discretionary sector is not comprised of consumer staples like food or tech. Consequently, consumer spending power can make it fluctuate. During recessions, the consumer discretionary industry can take a hit, as consumers hold on to old vehicles instead of buying new ones and have less cash to spend on non-essentials like travel. Because of their potential to fluctuate, consumer discretionary stocks are also referred to as the consumer cyclical sector. Consumer staples will always be in high demand, but discretionary items are not essential. To that end, market sectors like technology stocks and consumer staples (such as food) might have more balanced performances throughout the year. However, consumer confidence and brand loyalty can stabilize the consumer discretionary sector. By and large, despite the waves of the market the biggest players in the consumer discretionary sector are stable Fortune 500 companies, and not necessarily the best growth stocks for short-term traders; however, long-distance investors will appreciate their stability, and in many cases, the dividends they pay. The biggest players in this industry have been in business for decades—some even more than a century. Over those years, through quality products and solid management, they have solidified their footprint and positioned themselves to respond to rebound from bad times, while staying ahead of upstart competition. If you’re wondering what stocks to buy, this stocks list will provide you with some of the biggest names in this global industry. GM, or General Motors (NYSE: GM), has been designing, producing, and selling motor vehicles since 1908. It’s the largest car manufacturer in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. GM has recently been ranked #10 on the Fortune 500 list of American corporations in terms of revenue. Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac are their core brands, and a quick look at other vehicles on the road will","Dec 9, 2019",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/consumer-discretionary-sector-stocks/

Another year of solid U.S. economic growth has pushed the stock market to all-time highs in 2019, but conditions in the restaurant industry have been challenging. Bank of America analyst Gregory Francfort says store growth trends are driving market share away from weaker restaurants and toward stronger brands, making stock selection critical for investors. Francfort recently updated his projections for 2020 total shareholder returns (earnings growth plus dividends) within the restaurant group.

Vistara Airlines | Lufthansa Press Trust of India  |  New Delhi 
Last Updated at December 9, 2019 21:45 IST Vistara has entered into a codeshare pact with German airline Lufthansa, the sixth such agreement with an international airline as the domestic full service carrier seeks to expand its overseas network. As part of the agreement, Lufthansa will add its 'LH' designator code to nearly 18 Vistara-operated flights every day covering ten Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. The two carriers already have an interline partnership. Vistara is the second airline after Air India to have a codeshare agreement with Lufthansa. In a release on Monday, Vistara said the two airlines are planning to soon expand scope of the agreement, enabling frequent fliers of both airlines to earn miles/ points when travelling on each other's networks and enjoy other benefits. Codesharing allows an airline to book its passengers on its partner carriers and provide seamless travel to destinations where it has no presence. An interline arrangement refers to a pact to issue and accept tickets for flights that are operated by the partner airline. Apart from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, the codeshare agreement with Lufthansa will cover Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Goa, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Kochi and Pune. ""Sales under the codeshare agreement progressively open today on all channels and major GDS systems for flights starting December 16, 2019,"" the release said. Vinod Kannan, Vistara's Chief Strategy Officer, said as a growing global carrier, one of its key goals is to offer an extended international network to customers through such strategic associations. Vistara and Lufthansa already have an interline/ Through Check-in agreement, using which customers can seamlessly connect from Vistara-operated domestic flights in India to Lufthansa-operated flights to both of its hubs in Frankfurt and Munich and beyond. Using the Through Check-in facility, customers get their boarding passes at the first point of departure for all the travel sectors, both domestic and international, with their baggage checked through to the final destination, as per the release.

This may influence which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Welcome to the world of miles and points! We’re glad you’re here. In this beginners guide, we’ll show you the basics of miles and points (or “travel rewards”). We will explain this hobby, the different types of travel reward “currencies,” the best ways to earn miles and points — and of course, how to redeem travel rewards. So sit back and get comfortable as we help demystify the fun and exciting world of miles and points. This is an important question to consider when evaluating what you would like to get out of your miles and points hobby. Do you want to travel several times a year to an exotic location, flying in first class on miles and paying for your hotel on points? Do you want to fly to visit friends and family using miles (but don’t care if you sit in economy or business class)? Or do you just want to learn what travel rewards are all about? The good news is that regardless of your travel goals, understanding miles and points can make those goals a reality. Using travel rewards to see the world can save a lot of cash. And when you get into this hobby, you begin to realize that all sorts of travel is affordable and within reach. You know those people who say they flew in first class nearly for free and only paid $5 in taxes? Well, those people used airline miles to fly. They didn’t pay $4,000+ for that first class seat. The gist of using miles and points is simple: Sign up for a credit card that earns travel rewards and redeem those rewards for plane tickets or hotel nights instead of paying with cash. To keep earning travel rewards, use that credit card as your primary source of payment for everything. Stop using cash or a debit card, because neither method of payment earns travel rewards. That thesis alone is the bulk of the miles and points hobby. The rest is knowing how to maximize your earnings and use award charts to book the travel you want.
