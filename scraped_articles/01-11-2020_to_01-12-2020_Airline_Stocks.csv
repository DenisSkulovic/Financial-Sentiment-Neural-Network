1,'Worst thing' investors could do right now is sell: PNC's Amanda Agati,"‘Worst thing’ an investor could do right now is take profits, PNC’s Amanda Agati says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News","If you feel the urge to take profits as stocks hit new highs, PNC Financial’s Amanda Agati has a message for you: Resist it. According to the firm’s chief investment strategist, the market is not at peak levels. “The worst thing that clients and investors can do with the market at current levels is pull the plug and go underweight equities,” she told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “There’s time left on the clock. We still think there’s room for this market to move higher.” Her analysis came shortly after the Dow crossed 29,000 for the first time ever. It’s now up 32% since 2018′s historic Christmas Eve market drop. The S&P 500 is on fire, too — soaring almost 40% since then. “We actually have a fairly favorable view for 2020,” she said. “I’d like to see this rally take a little bit of a pause or slow down a little bit just for the fundamentals to catch up. But we actually think 2020 is going to shape up to be a pretty solid year.” Agati was optimistic going into last year, too. She told investors not to stop believing in the bull market despite the wild swings. Her advice paid off. Stocks reached unprecedented record high levels in 2019. “It can be very painful to get too defensive too soon,” added Agati. “We’ve had a handful of opportunities to actually do that really since December 2018, and it would have been a mistake.” Now, she sees another bullish dynamic unfolding. She calls 2020 a “tale of two halves.” Agati expects the first half will be dominated by improving fundamentals and earnings growth. By the second half of the year, she warns uncertainty surrounding November’s presidential election could inject volatility into the picture and create downward pressure. However, her thesis calls for a resilient market boosted by sustainable re-acceleration of earnings and global growth. Agati estimates stocks could be up 10% by year-end. “Even though it may not be a 30% from a return perspective, we still think we can get a pretty solid result,” Agati said.

The budget airline will partner with three different carbon-offsetting organizations to become the,"   Air travel has been a growth industry over the past decade, and especially for the past five years. Consumers have taken to the skies more often, part of a broader shift in discretionary spending away from ""stuff"" and toward travel and other experiences. It certainly hasn't hurt that inflation-adjusted airfares are near record lows in the U.S. thanks to the rapid growth of budget carriers. U.S. airlines carried more than 800 million passengers on domestic routes during the 12-month period that ended in September, up from a little more than 600 million a decade earlier. However, ""flight shaming"" represents a rising risk to this growth trend. As the public becomes more aware of the environmental impact of air travel, some consumers have resolved to try to fly less frequently, or even stop doing so altogether. Now, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) hopes it has an answer to the concerns of environmentally conscious travelers. Last week, the trendy low-fare carrier announced that it will offset the carbon emissions for all its domestic flights starting in July 2020. JETBLUE WILL GO CARBON-NEUTRAL FOR DOMESTIC FLIGHTS LATER THIS YEAR. IMAGE SOURCE: JETBLUE AIRWAYS. JetBlue has already been offsetting some of its carbon emissions through a partnership with Carbonfund.org. It will now expand that relationship while also partnering with EcoAct and South Pole on additional carbon offset projects. Beginning in July, the airline expects to offset a total of 15 billion to 17 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emissions annually -- equivalent to the emissions from all of its domestic flights, and little over 70% of its global capacity. JetBlue plans to fund a variety of carbon offset projects, with a particular focus on forest conservation, landfill gas capture, and solar- and wind-power plant construction. In addition, JetBlue will invest in reducing its emissions -- or at least in mitigating the impact of the company's growth. Among other things, it will use renewable jet fuel (blended with regular jet fuel) on flights from San Francisco beginning later this year. This sustainable fuel has a carbon footprint that is as much as 80% lower than traditional fossil-fuel-derived jet fuel, according to the company. Finally, JetBlue will dramatically improve its fuel-efficiency thanks to the purchase of nearly 150 next-generation aircraft it has ordered for delivery over the next six years. Most notably, the 70 Airbus A220-300s it has on order will be up to 40%","Jan 11, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/11/jetblue-will-go-carbon-neutral-on-domestic-flights.aspx

Sony (SNE) Issued a Blockbuster","By Justin Spittler A new supercycle is revving up. And if history repeats, this supercycle will hand out profits of 8X to 18X, starting now. If you’ve studied investing, you’ve likely come across the idea of “cyclical” assets. Cyclical assets go through boom and bust cycles. One year they surge in price, the next year they plummet. Housing stocks are cyclical (read our recent guide on how to profit from the biggest housing boom in history), airline stocks are cyclical, gold is famously cyclical. Most commodities like oil, wheat, and steel are cyclical. Let me tell you about a new supercycle that was just born in a quiet corner of the markets. Like other cyclical assets, the “video game supercycle” has everything to do with supply and demand. You see, a new generation of video game consoles comes out every five to eight years. These new consoles run faster than previous versions. They feature better graphics and offer new games. This isn’t just a big deal for “gamers.” It’s a mammoth opportunity for investors. During the last video game boom, you could have pocketed returns of 8X, 14X, and 18X in just six years! It said it will release its highly anticipated PlayStation 5 video game console next year. Microsoft (MSFT) will also introduce its “next-gen” console—code named “Project Scarlett”—just in time for the 2020 holidays. The video game industry has been waiting years for this news. Sony last made an announcement like this in February 2013 when it unveiled the PlayStation 4. Eight months later, PlayStation 4 hit the shelves. Microsoft rolled out its own system, Xbox One, a week later. Since then, Sony has sold more than 90 million PS4s! Microsoft has sold 44 million Xbox Ones. Electronic Arts (EA), which makes the popular FIFA and Madden NFL video games series, soared 1,261% between 2012 and 2018.  Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) threw off even bigger gains. Take-Two is best known for its Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto game series. Its share price skyrocketed 1,665% during the last supercycle.  Activision Blizzard (ATVI), best known for its insanely popular Call of Duty series, posted the smallest gains of these three. It surged “just” 690% from 2012 to 2018.

7,Ryanair Boss Might Get His $110 Million Bonus - The Washington Post,Ryanair Boss Might Get His $110 Million Bonus. . Today’s Headlines. I’m a Black woman writing about money and race.,"When shareholders narrowly voted to approve a possible 99 million euros ($110 million) bonus for Ryanair Holdings Plc boss Michael O’Leary in September, it seemed unlikely they’d actually have to pay him the money. The terms of the reward plan require O’Leary to get the stock price back above 21 euros, and at the time of the annual meeting it was languishing at less than 10 euros. (Alternatively he needs to double net profit). How times have changed. On Friday the shares jumped as much as 11% after Ryanair reported stronger than expected Christmas sales and ticket prices. The stock has gained almost two-thirds since the AGM, meaning O’Leary’s windfall is back within grasp. His stock options are triggered if the share price exceeds 21 euros for a four-week period between April 2021 and March 2024. A year ago I wrote that Ryanair’s bonus plan is pretty egregious because the share price might jump for reasons that have nothing to do with O’Leary’s skills as a manager. Guess what? That’s exactly what has happened — in myriad fortunate ways. European stocks have rallied since September thanks in part to the massive liquidity boost provided by the U.S. Federal Reserve. And airlines stocks in general have far outstripped the average for a variety of economic and structural factors. Boris Johnson’s thumping U.K. election victory means a no-deal Brexit is off the table (for now) and has boosted the pound, which is positive for Ryanair’s British revenues. And Thomas Cook Group Plc’s insolvency and cash-strapped Norwegian Air Shuttle’s diminished ambitions have supported ticket prices because of less competition. Another factor supporting prices is the grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max following two fatal crashes, which means an expected surge of aircraft capacity hasn’t materialized. Ryanair is, of course, a big 737 Max customer and Boeing’s inability to deliver those planes has been extremely disruptive for O’Leary and limited his ability to expand. Yet one silver lining is that his airline has cut back on less profitable routes and is no longer struggling with a pilot shortage, which contributed to recent labor unrest and investor concerns about rising personnel costs.  One day the 737 Max will fly again, at which time a capacity glut will probably re-emerge; analysts at Citigroup Inc. note the size of the 737 Max order book in Europe is equivalent to 9% of the continent’s entire aircraft fleet.","Jan 11, 2020",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/ryanair-boss-might-get-his-110-million-bonus/2020/01/10/436e9efe-339b-11ea-971b-43bec3ff9860_story.html

USD/JPY.,"                                                   David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital. When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (LON:IAG) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders? Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for International Consolidated Airlines Group You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2019 International Consolidated Airlines Group had €1.56b of debt, an increase on €1.8k, over one year. However, its balance sheet shows it holds €7.99b in cash, so it actually has €6.43b net cash. According to the last reported balance sheet, International Consolidated Airlines Group had liabilities of €14.8b due within 12 months, and liabilities of €14.7b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had €7.99b in cash and €2.21b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling €19.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined. When you consider that this deficiency exceeds the company's huge €15.5b market capitalization, you might well be inclined to review the balance sheet intently. In the scenario where the company had to clean up its balance sheet quickly, it seems likely shareholders would suffer extensive dilution. International Consolidated Airlines Group boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it","Jan 11, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-international-consolidated-airlines-group-074552278.html

The Philippine Stock Exchange Index tumbled 9.9 percent in the second quarter, buffeted by a weakening peso, quickening inflation, and the brewing trade war between the U.S. and China, not to mention the general selloff in emerging markets. Photographer: Carlo Gabuco/Bloomberg , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- When it comes to Philippine stocks, 2020 so far isn’t looking better than 2019. Barely two weeks into the new year, and the market is the worst performer among major Asian peers, with overseas fund withdrawals reminiscent of January 2008. Back then, fears of a U.S. recession roiled global shares and pummeled Manila into a bear market. Last year, Philippine equities were already among the region’s laggards. Expectations of a weaker peso and fears of regulatory risk over a contract dispute between the government and Manila’s water utilities could be holding back investors from scooping up Philippine equities, even amid the prospects of faster economic growth, according to Rachelle Cruz, an analyst at AP Securities Inc. An added factor is the uncertainty over the passage of measures cutting corporate taxes and incentives, she said. After clocking a 4.7% gain in 2019 (the regional benchmark surged 16%), the Philippine Stock Exchange Index has retreated 0.5% this year as overseas funds have pulled $44 million, one of the biggest outflow in Asia. Foreign investors dumped almost $100 million over a similar period at the start of 2008, just as the index was about to sink into a bear market. The Philippine stock exchange suspended trading Monday after the government said there’s an imminent threat of a hazardous eruption of the Taal Volcano, now rumbling and spewing ash and smoke just 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of the capital Manila. Foreign investors have pulled more than $1.3 billion from Philippine equity funds in the last two years as the nation was hit by rising inflation and slowing economic growth, coupled with sell-offs triggered by a U.S.-China trade war.

13,"Trump slashed corporate tax rates to 21%, but many companies paid far less than that",. . . . . . . . . Cowboys may have finally committed a cardinal sin in the eyes,"  BUSINESSCOMMENTARY By Mitchell Schnurman 6:00 AM on Jan 12, 2020 CST Two years ago, President Donald Trump’s tax cuts slashed corporate rates from 35% to 21%, and the big gift to business was one reason the tax law wasn’t popular. Here’s another reason to complain: Many companies aren’t paying even the lower rate.   In 2018, the first year under the new law, 379 profitable companies in the Fortune 500 paid an average effective rate of 11.3%, according to a study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a progressive think tank in Washington. That’s the lowest rate since the institute began studying the issue in 1984. In its previous study, which tracked results from 2008 to 2015, large, profitable companies paid an average of 21.2% — higher than in 2018 but far lower than the 35% maximum. “Tax avoidance appears to be every bit as much of a problem under the new tax system as it was before the Trump tax law took effect,” Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow and co-author of the report, wrote last month. “This means these companies sheltered almost half of their U.S. pretax income from federal income tax in 2018.” For 91 companies, nearly a quarter of those examined, their 2018 federal tax bill was zero or they got a tax rebate, the group said. The list includes heavyweights like Amazon, Chevron and Netflix. As a group, the 91 companies earned a combined $101 billion in pretax profits. Researchers have proven that being helpful to others releases dopamine — the “feel-good” chemical — in our brains and lights up the same... The report identified several Dallas-Fort Worth companies that paid no federal income tax in ’18, including American Airlines, McKesson Corp. and Pioneer Natural Resources. The U.S. collected $92 billion less in corporate income tax in 2018, a one-year decline of 31%. Since 1934, only the Great Recession had a steeper fall in that measure. “Such a large year-over-year drop in corporate income tax revenue is unprecedented during a time of economic growth,” wrote the Peter Peterson Foundation. Last fall, the Congressional Budget Office updated the forecast on corporate income taxes, suggesting that the tax cuts would cost much more than expected. Compared with projections before the law, revenue from corporate income taxes are now forecast to fall by $750 billion over 10 years, much more than initially thought.

Mnuchin dismisses 'rumor' that China's commitments in phase one of trade deal was changed,"Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday dismissed the “rumor” that China’s commitments in phase one of the trade deal were changed in translation. During an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” Mnuchin denied that China’s commitment to buy $40 billion to $50 billion of U.S. agricultural products and $200 billion of U.S. products over two years changed when translating the trade deal. “It wasn’t changed in translation,” he said. “I don’t know where that rumor started.” “We have been going through a translation process that I think we said was really a technical issue,” Mnuchin said.  Treasure Secretary Steve Mnuchin discusses the impact of new Iran sanctions https://t.co/BZ3O6EsU9y @SundayFutures @FoxNews  The secretary also maintained that the “snapback provision” remains in the trade deal, which would allow the U.S. to snapback tariffs if China does not follow through with its promises.  China has not yet confirmed those commitments, Reuters reported. Chinese officials have also not released many details about the agreement because the U.S. has switched positions repeatedly, three Chinese officials told Reuters last week.  White House officials said as late as Friday that the Chinese text of the agreement was not finished, according to Reuters.  The first phase of the trade deal will stop any additional tariffs and suspend some others but will still leave tariffs on $370 billion of Chinese imports, in addition to the Chinese purchasing commitments. The second phase will focus on more sensitive issues like digital trade, cybersecurity and Chinese state-owned companies.
