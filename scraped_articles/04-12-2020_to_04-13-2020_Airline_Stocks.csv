3,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. Bailout funds will be harder to obtain than investors had hoped.. What happened. So,"   Airline stocks were under pressure on Monday after weekend reports indicating the U.S. Treasury Department is playing hardball in negotiations over bailout funds. Investors turned optimistic after the $2 trillion economic stimulus plan cleared Congress in late March, but it now appears clear the airlines will not have easy access to the funds. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) led the rout, down more than 9% as of 11 a.m. EDT, with shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) all down 7% or more. Airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused travel demand to dry up overnight. As companies expect revenue to fall by upward of 90% year over year, they have cut flights, grounded planes, and sought other ways to reduce expenses. Those cuts include offering voluntary retirements or leave to employees, but so far no layoffs. Airlines have resisted layoffs in part because they expected $25 billion in grants as part of the stimulus bill earmarked to help them meet payroll. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Reuters reported over the weekend that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and staffers have told airlines the government will require the companies to repay 30% of the grants in low-cost loans over 10 years, while also seeking warrants equal to 10% of the loan amount. Airlines, according to the report, have balked at that demand, noting that the $25 billion in total funding doesn't even cover the full amount of payroll costs submitted. The standoff between Treasury and airlines is a risky proposition for both sides. The airlines need cash if they are to survive the pandemic-caused downturn and a potential slow recovery in travel once the outbreak is contained. The alternative is likely massive layoffs or at least furloughs, putting more strain on unemployment resources at a time when jobless claims are skyrocketing. Treasury's insistence on repayment has united labor and management, a rarity in the airline industry. David Weaver, communications director for the Air Line Pilots Association, a major pilot union, in a Sunday-night tweet warned Treasury is ""threatening the jobs"" of pilots and other aviation workers by treating grants like loans. And Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, wrote that Treasury is ""stealing from the money Congress allocated directly to","Apr 13, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/13/why-airline-shares-are-falling-today.aspx

Are they cheap now relative to the market? - Valens Research - Valens Research,Philippine Markets Daily. MONDAY MACRO: Have Philippine airline stocks been able to fly to recovery after the recent market selloff?,"This industry was one of the first affected by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus more than two months ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a global health emergency, this industry took an even greater hit as demand for domestic and international travel drastically declined. Companies in this industry have already laid off a sizable percentage of their workforce to combat rising costs. However, with no clear timeline as to when the health crisis will be resolved, this industry may continue to suffer large losses indefinitely. Below, we’ll take a look at two main players in this industry and how they fared during the recent Philippine stock market selloff. Philippine Markets Daily:
The Monday Macro Report
Powered by Valens Research Globally, the airline industry is one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Air travel was identified as one of the ways that the virus spread across different countries more than two months ago. Numerous countries and territories closed their borders as a precautionary measure against the spread of the disease. Travel bans, coupled with steep declines in demand, have made it impossible for airlines to operate normally. With a limited source of revenue, airlines have to find ways to offset their massive fixed costs in order to survive this crisis. Cebu Air, Inc. (CEB:PHL) and PAL Holdings Inc. (PAL:PHL), two of the main players in the Philippine domestic market, announced in March that they will cut down their workforce by over 150 and by 300 employees, respectively. For Cebu Air, this cost reduction initiative was implemented to a lesser extent as prior to their lay-off announcement, its executives voluntarily took pay cuts. Normally, if management thinks they can weather through the headwinds, one of the last actions they would take to manage their costs is lay off their employees. Mass layoffs would cost the company more in the long-run due to the need to foster new talents and increase workforce as operation level improves. Workforce reduction, particularly during this time, implies management’s negative outlook in both the near and medium term. However, the uncertainty surrounding this health crisis has raised concerns beyond simply the economic impact of temporarily suspending most airline operations. Another area of concern is how soon leisure travel will return to its pre-COVID-19 norm. According to the Philippine Department of Tourism, China is the second largest major consumer in the Philippine international travel volume, with 18%","Apr 13, 2020",https://www.valens-research.com/philippine-markets-daily/monday-macro-have-philippine-airline-stocks-been-able-to-fly-to-recovery-after-the-recent-market-selloff-are-they-cheap-now-relative-to-the-market/

Warren Buffett Sold His Airline Stocks: Should You Avoid Air Canada (TSX:AC)?.,"      Christopher Liew, CFA | April 13, 2020 | More on: AC Has Warren Buffett broken his long-term investing principle with his dumping of airline stocks? His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, recently sold its holdings in Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines. In Canada, the country’s flag carrier is taking a major hit. The National Air Council of Canada, the representative of larger air operators in the country, is requesting the government to act swiftly to help the aviation industry. Similarly, the Air Transport Association of Canada (ATAC) is sounding the call on behalf of the smaller airline companies. Investors are now doubting if Air Canada (TSX:AC)(TSX:AC.B) can bounce back from the horrific impact of the novel coronavirus. Canada’s airline industry contributes about $49 billion to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). The industry also employs around 60,000. While other governments in Europe and Asia, as well as the U.S., have announced direct financial support, industry representatives in Canada are desperately awaiting a bailout. The temporary layoffs of employees have begun in Air Canada. As the airline company drastically reduces capacity, the layoffs of about 15,200 unionized workers and 1,300 managers will last through April and May 2020. Letting go of 16,500 workers is a painful decision by management. However, the move will enable Air Canada to save at least $500 million as part of its cost reduction scheme. Its CEO Mike Rousseau will forego 100% of his salary while the rest of the executive team will take between 25% to 50% pay cuts. The sale of Buffett’s airline stocks was a surprise to investors. Berkshire has turned from buyer to seller. The company sold 13 million and 2.3 million shares of Delta and Southwest, respectively. Warren Buffett might sell his shares in American Airlines next. Many view the losses of airline stocks are no longer tolerable. The airline industry is the hardest hit by COVID-19. Travel restrictions and border closures have practically brought the business to a standstill. Air Canada has lost its wings. From $48.51 at the beginning of 2020, the share price has fallen by 65.84% to $16.57 as of this writing. During the same period, the market capitalization has gone down by $8.63 billion. It now stands at $4.37 billion. The deal to acquire tour operator Transat is also in peril. It would have been the new growth driver for Air Canada.

7,Airline Stocks or Cruise Stocks: Which is the Better Investment?,. . Airline Stocks or Cruise Stocks: Which is the Better Investment?. COMPANIES MENTIONED IN THIS ARTICLE. MOST READ THIS,"  It’s safe to say that the travel industry is experiencing an extraordinary drop in consumer demand. The coronavirus pandemic has led to a complete global economic shutdown. People are simply not traveling and the shares of companies in the travel industry have experienced the worst of the market downturn over the last month. However, there are still plenty of investors out there that are interested in these businesses thanks to their extremely discounted share prices. Two types of travel-related companies that many are looking at as potential buying opportunities are airline stocks and cruise line stocks. These companies are essentially unable to earn revenue at this point in time due to the pandemic lockdown, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t be able to come back strong when things start improving. The right questions to ask are which one will be able to ramp their business back up sooner and which has better long-term prospects? Let’s evaluate whether airline stocks or cruise stocks are a better investment opportunity below. Airline Stocks: Grounded The major airline companies are seriously hurting right now since the demand for flights has dropped to unprecedented levels over the fear of the coronavirus. Companies like Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) have stated that they are losing $60 million a day due to a 95% drop in year-over-year monthly demand for their flights. Even though the industry is in turmoil, it’s hard to imagine a scenario where all of the major airlines like Delta, Southwest, and United go bankrupt. We’ve already seen a $2 trillion-dollar stimulus package signed into law that includes the government taking a $50 billion stake in airlines. That should help these companies survive the negative circumstances in the short-term, but trying to forecast their financial performance over the long-term is another task entirely. It’s important to understand that airline companies will need to adapt if they plan to make it through this health crisis. You will see the industry leaders with strong management teams separate themselves from the pack over the next few months. Earnings per share growth will be nonexistent for airlines in 2020 and demand for air travel will potentially be permanently altered going forward. It will be a while before these companies can charge the same prices for flights that they were prior to the coronavirus outbreak. Business air travel will likely return to normal sooner than leisure air travel,","Apr 13, 2020",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/airline-stocks-or-cruise-stocks-which-is-the-better-investment/

DAL stock may look cheap, but I'd"," In recent days, investors seem to have a more optimistic outlook on the potential health and economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. As a result, many shares have gone up double digits. However, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has not fully participated in this move up. Year-to-date, DAL stock is down about 58%, which means the shares are now in a bear market.  Although the airline has not confirmed its next quarterly earnings release date, it is expected to report Q1 earnings by mid-April. In recent days, legendary investor Warren Buffett has slashed his exposure to the industry. I believe that the change in his stance is important and that it may still be too soon to buy into airline shares including DAL. Let’s take a closer look. A large number of countries have now banned almost all international travel. Domestic travel in the U.S. remains quite restricted too. And most consumers are not likely to travel much any time soon unless it is an emergency. Thus U.S. airlines have been suspending a majority of flights for the foreseeable future. As early as mid-March, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian confirmed that the airline had negative net bookings. In other words, it had more cancellations than new reservations. He also announced that he’d not be taking any salary for the next six months. So far Delta has cut about 70% of capacity and grounded 600 planes. Similarly, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has cut 50% of its capacity —  40% domestically and 75% internationally. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has notified airlines that they must issue customer refunds for canceled flights. Other steps the company has taken to mitigate the financial aspect of the outbreak include a company-wide hiring freeze, deferring $500 million in capital expenditures and delaying $500 million of voluntary pension funding. In summary, airlines have been struggling financially for weeks. Delta’s YoY revenue was down $2 billion in March. Unless the global pandemic is under control soon, it is not possible to know when any airline will be able to go back to full capacity and improve its revenue levels again. On March 27, President Trump signed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law. It includes more than $50 billion for commercial airlines, including $25 billion in direct grants. The news was the lifeline airline executives had been hoping for. On April 3, American Airlines,","Apr 12, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/04/warren-buffett-sells-dal-stock-bail/

The discussions might not result in any deals, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. But they underscore airlines' desperation since the pandemic shut down the U.S. economy and canceled thousands of flights. U.S. carriers have cut about 70% of flying this month and have warned that deeper reductions might be ahead. At last check United Airlines shares were down 8.4% at $28.87.

U.S. airlines have mortgaged gates, flight paths and other assets to secure billions of dollars of loans in recent weeks. But that will not be enough to get the companies through a slump that is expected to last for months. Banks routinely buy miles from airlines to reward consumers for spending on their credit cards. But these discussions would see the banks buy miles all at once and at a discount, instead of buying them later as cardholders accrued points. The cash infusion could help keep the airlines alive, protecting card partnerships that generate billions of dollars of annual spending volume. Airlines that chose this option sacrifice future revenue and could lose the upper hand in negotiations with their lending partners. The $2 trillion stimulus package Congress passed last month set aside as much as $50 billion in grants and loans for U.S. airlines, though participation would likely require surrendering equity stakes to the U.S. Treasury.
