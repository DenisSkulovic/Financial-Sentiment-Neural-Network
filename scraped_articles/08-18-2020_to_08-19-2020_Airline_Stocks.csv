0,Why Airline Shares Jumped Higher Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Jumped Higher Today. Optimism from Southwest gives the entire sector a lift.. What happened. So what. Now,"   I've been saying for a while now that as long as the COVID-19 pandemic is dominating headlines airline shares are likely to trade as a group, focused on hints about future demand, rather than simply based on company-specific news. On Tuesday morning, we saw an illustration of this phenomenon. On Tuesday shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) all traded up more than 5% based on positive commentary from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), yet Southwest shares didn't climb as high as shares of its rivals. Airlines have been in a free fall due to the pandemic, with revenue down 80% or more year-over-year and customers refusing to take to the skies. The entire sector plummeted early in the pandemic, and in the months since, the stocks have largely traded in tandem based on positive or negative headlines surrounding the pandemic and how long it might take for travel demand to recover. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. A Southwest regulatory filing sparked a rally in airline shares on Tuesday. The company said it feels good enough about its liquidity and access to private capital to forgo a government assistance program its CEO had previously called ""pretty onerous."" Southwest also said it was seeing improved leisure demand in August and heading into September, helping it to lower its estimate for third-quarter average daily cash burn to $20 million from $23 million. Southwest has a domestic-focused network, and for a decade now the airline has been among the leaders in leisure market share. But the markets on Tuesday are interpreting good news from Southwest about demand as good news for the entire sector, pushing its major rivals higher as well. There are plenty of caveats to this bout of optimism. While Southwest is feeling good enough about its financial position not to take the government loans, others including American have indicated they do intend to tap the government for further liquidity. And even if demand has improved slightly, the overall outlook is still bleak. Southwest expects third-quarter capacity to decrease by 30% to 35% year over year. That's worse than its previous estimate for a 20% to 30% decline. As summer ends some of that leisure demand is going to dry up. Southwest expects October capacity to be down 40% to 50% compared to 2019. The good news is that thanks to the government","Aug 19, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/19/why-airline-shares-jumped-higher-today/

One day after breaking","   Looks like investors will have to wait at least another day to set a record. The S&P 500 Index (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 14.9 points, or just under 0.5%, on Aug. 19, giving up some ground after closing at an all-time high yesterday. Today wasn't particularly volatile, but the sentiment turned clearly bearish in afternoon trading; after looking like another record close was going to happen, the index steadily sold off in the last two hours.  The sell-off wasn't steep, but it was broad, with more than 340 of the 505 stocks in the index closing lower. Notable losers today include discount retailers TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) and Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), down 5.4% and 4.3%, respectively, and retail real estate investment trusts Regency Centers and Kimco Realty Corp, both down more than 3%. The biggest loser today was Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY), down almost 13% after reporting earnings and guidance for next quarter that disappointed investors.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. On the upswing was Target Corp (NYSE:TGT), reporting strong quarterly earnings that sent investors on a shopping spree, pushing shares 13% higher. No other S&P stock gained as much as 4% on the day. Investors were looking forward to TJX Companies' earnings, released before market open today, but the result disappointed. The discount retailer reported a $214 million loss; that wasn't a complete surprise due to the second-quarter shutdown of almost all of its stores, and it was actually better than management said it expected internally. But what did catch people off guard was what management had to say about its more recent results. Even with most of its stores now reopened, slow traffic and supply chain challenges are expected to keep sales from fully recovering in the current quarter.  Competitor Ross Stores' stock also fell today, likely on investors ""selling the news"" of TJX's ongoing struggles. Ross is scheduled to report its own quarterly results and update its recent business activity tomorrow, Aug. 20, after market close.  Target isn't suffering the same weakness that TJX reported, and investors fear Ross may also be experiencing. While the discounters are struggling, Target has seen the coronavirus pandemic act as a catalyst to help it grow. The company reported second-quarter same-store sales increased 24%, driven by a huge increase in online orders.

4,Airline Stocks Gain After U.S. and China Agree to Double Flights -capitalwatch.com,Airline Stocks Gain After U.S. and China Agree to Double Flights,"Airliners saw some solid gains Wednesday thanks to the United States and China agreeing to double the number of flights between the two countries.  The U.S. Transportation Department said Tuesday that it is allowing four Chinese airlines to increase their round trip flights to the U.S to eight per week.  Following the news, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: UAL) doubled flights from San Francisco and Shanghai from two to four. The move will go into effect on Sept. 4. The Chicago-based carrier will use a Boeing (NYSE: BA) 777-300ER aircraft to operate that route on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The U.S. Gainers Thanks to the announcement, UAL watched its stock soar nearly 6% to $35.89 per share by midday Wednesday. But that wasn't the only gainer. Even American Airlines Group Inc. (Nasdaq: AAL) saw its shares rise despite its cargo full of debt by nearly 4% to $13.06 per share. Other major U.S. carriers including Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL), and Southwest Airlines Co., (NYSE: LUV) posted gains of roughly 3% intraday.  The Chinese Gainers Chinese U.S.-listed airline stocks also took flight.  China Eastern Airlines Corp. Ltd. (NYSE: CEA) and China Southern Airlines Company Ltd., (NYSE: ZNH) both gained 1% by midday.  Trouble on the Tarmac Will Remain  Even as travel picks up, the industry is still going to suffer until a safe and effective vaccine hits the market—which is why I remain skeptical of the industry for the remainder of the year.  However, one stock I did recommend buying was Southwest whose shares are now up 18% to date since I recommended it in May. But if you’re a shareholder in airliners—the pain is likely to continue for the rest of the year.   In May, American billionaire investor Warren Buffett had finally seen enough from airliners and dumped full stakes in the country's four largest carriers. He also recently dumped bank equities in favor of a gold mining stock. He has been wrong a lot this year but he is right about airlines. Hold Southwest if you bought in May, and leave the other airline stocks alone until economic and virus clouds dissipate.

8,Investing into airline? : stocks,Investing into airline?. Investing into airline?,"Hellp folks, i would like to hear your opinion about investing into airlines. Due to Covid-19 every airline makes huge losses and share prizes are at an ATL or the lowest in years. I have interest in 3 airline groups: Japan airlines, share prize is at 15,7 euros by the time I am writing this. Before Covid-19, it was around 25-30 euros. But I see potential in about a huge spike in the upcoming winter and early 2021, because of the Tokyo summer olympics. International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, share prize is at 2,125 euros and before Covid-19 it was around 8 euros. Once again I see potential because first of all next years olympics and the 2021 Football European Championship Avianca Holdings, it is a Colombian airlines group based in Panama, in mid may this year it filed for bankruptcy, the current share prize is at 0,336 euros and before Covid-19 it was around 4,5 euros. However it made 4,1 billion dollar in revenue in 2019 and employes around 20.000 people, therefore I think it is very unlikely that the Colombian government won't give them a bailout. Also just like the previous 2 examples, I see a lot of pontential, the 2021 summer olympics and the 2021 Football Copa America which is hosted by Colombia itself.  This however all depends on Corona development in the given countries and regions, the vaccine deveolopment and if fans are even allowed to travel to stadiums etc. next year. Too risky IMO. Investing into a firm that filed for bankruptcy? Just go to Vegas if you wanna gamble. Or send me the money if you desperately wanna burn cash i would have waited for a bailout, and if there is none i would not invest into it... Airlines is hitting hard. Also, cruise the same. I invest a bit there but scary. I dont think it will recover even at 2021. I read some news that, airlines wont make money without offering business class. Plus discounted tickets doesn't even sound appealing to anyone right now.              ","Aug 18, 2020",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ibzgfd/investing_into_airline/

IAG shares struggle"," Airlines like IAG, easyJet and Ryanair have finally seen their share prices take flight after months of turbulence, but with a resurgence in new Covid-19 cases leading to travel restrictions is it time to buy? The aviation industry has been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines grounded for months, wiping out companies profits and sending share prices tumbling. But with lockdown restrictions easing over the summer months and holidaymakers desperate to travel, airline stocks like International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), easyJet and Ryanair have finally seen their shares take flight again. But with intermittent spikes in new Covid-19 cases throughout Europe leading to travel restrictions and quarantines for passengers returning from holiday, is the recent rally by airline stocks looks like it will be short-lived? Go long or short on thousands of international stocks. Despite IAG shares surging in the first half of August, analysts at Davy cut their rating for the stock to ‘neutral’ and issued a target price of 200p ahead of the company’s €2.75 billion rights issue. As it stands, IAG shares are trading below that target at 192p at the time of publication, with the stock down 70% year-to-date. In a note to clients, Davy analysts Stephen Furlong and Ross Harvey said that IAG’s upcoming rights issue, which is expected to take place in September, will likely dilute shareholders by at least 50% in exchange of the €2.75 billion the company seeks. ‘We… downgrade IAG to 'neutral' with its highly dilutive rights issue to come in September,’ Furlong and Harvey wrote. ‘The pertinent question for the network airlines, which transfer passengers through large hubs connecting long-haul destinations, is whether they can recover and, if so, how long will this take.’ The path ahead remains challenging for the British Airways owner, with company admitting it will take at least four years to return to pre-crisis passenger levels. IAG is forecast to record a €2.9 billion operating loss in 2020. The airline group’s outlook in the years ahead is promising, however, with it expecting to generate €620 million profit in 2021, with that figure rising to €2 billion in 2022 and €2.7 billion in 2023. The budget airline said that it will close three of its bases in the UK this week after governments tightened travel restrictions in August due to spikes in new coronavirus cases.

13,AAL Stock: American Airlines Makes Less Sense for Value Investors | InvestorPlace,"American Airlines Makes Less Sense for Value Investors. American Airlines won't rebound soon, if ever; investors should throw in the"," When I last wrote about AAL stock I argued that it remained one to avoid. My opinion has not changed: there is currently no valid case for investing in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) long-term.   Technical analysts may well have valid cases for short-term options plays in AAL shares. That is all good and well. However, this article and analysis is intended for those value investors concerned with fundamentals and a longer horizon.  This article will synthesize some of American Airlines most recent earnings information and what that means for the stock. None of the news is particularly promising. So, the longer the pandemic wears on, the louder speculation regarding an American Airlines bankruptcy will become.  Investors keen to understand American Airlines should first look at the top line revenues. As with all businesses, revenues are the primary driver of success. No one expected AAL stock to be bolstered by strong revenue in Q2. Investor expectations were low heading into Q2. When the company posted total Q2 revenues of $1.62 billion, markets weren’t shocked. Still, investors comparing this to same period last year numbers should be worried. American posted nearly $12 billion in Q2 revenues in 2019. That figure represents an 86.45% decrease in revenues year-over-year. Not good. American suffered a loss of $2.05 billion in the second quarter, compared to income of $644 million in the same quarter a year ago. The point here is this: reasonable investors can’t rationally expect this stock to appreciate given that loss. Further, the $2 billion loss is not trivial. American would need to post three quarters like Q2 2019 in order to erase the loss it incurred this quarter. And even in that case, it would be short by more than $100 million. Investors should not expect that when air traffic levels normalize that AAL is going to return to pre-pandemic levels. Those who do are kidding themselves.    American Airlines is incurring debt to continue operations. AAL’s long-term debt has risen by more than 33% in the previous two quarters. The company ended 2019 with more than $21 billion in long-term debt which ballooned above $28 billion by June 30. The takeaway here is again the same: the effects will be felt over a long period of time and American can’t bounce back quickly from such a situation. Investors should not believe that air traffic alone","Aug 19, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/aal-stock-makes-less-sense-for-value-investors/

But South Korea’s top airlines are posting surprising profits with a unique strategy. By: Joseph Young | Email | Leave a comment Airline stocks have fallen substantially since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic in March. But South Korea’s top airlines are posting surprising profits with a unique strategy. Korea JoongAng Daily, the mainstream publication JoongAng’s English paper, reports Asiana Airlines saw a 115.1 billion won operating profit. A quarterly operating profit of over $97 million in Q2, while international flights plunged by 92 percent, is a staggering turnaround. Korean Airlines, the largest in South Korea, also posted a $130 million operating profit in the same quarter. Asiana Airlines employed a rather simplistic approach to post profits from April to June. The airline quickly realized that generating revenues from overseas passenger flights would be challenging due to various travel restrictions. The company turned to cargo transportation, utilizing its existing fleet of aircraft to transport goods from South Korea to overseas. According to the business publication Chosun, the cargo capacity of Asiana Airlines expanded by 95% in the second quarter.  Hankyung, another business outlet, said the two airlines were the only companies in the industry profitable in Q2.  There was one key difference in the approach of South Korean companies and other firms in the global market. Local publications say that major airlines decreased their cargo capacity since the end of the first quarter. Many companies rushed to minimize operating costs, reducing flights.","Aug 19, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/airline-stocks-profits-south-korea-blueprint/

Upgrade to DailyWealth Premium. . . ,"A few months ago, Wendy's ran out of hamburgers... The world is running out of small gold coins and bars... And iconic investor Warren Buffett has sold billions of dollars of airline stocks. Today, the economy is getting back on track. But there's plenty of uncertainty ahead. And Buffett's story is the perfect example of the toll it could take on your investments. COVID-19 is perhaps the most economically devastating event since World War II. Lives will be lost. Individuals will face tremendous financial hardships. Businesses will fold. Industries will crumble. And retail and other commercial real estate will fall in value. Yet stocks are up more than 50% from their March lows. And as I'll explain, caution does not necessarily mean that you have to stay out of the markets today... Although the federal government named U.S. meat-processing facilities ""essential businesses"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, many chose to close up shop or reduce operations to protect their employees. Only recently have they begun to reopen. Workers at these factories labor in tight quarters, making social distancing impossible. At least 16,000 industry workers had contracted COVID-19 by the end of May. The resulting supply shortage caused big problems for restaurants and consumers who rely on fresh meats, including fast-food places like Wendy's. It's the same story with metals refiners. Many metal refineries have shut down or halted production of small coins and bars because making those products requires many workers in a relatively confined space. The meat-processing and metals-refining industries will get back on track quickly once the COVID-19 pandemic response ends. But as for the airline industry, Buffett suspects it may take two or three years before people feel safe traveling on flying petri dishes as much as they used to. Buffett spoke at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska in May. Starting in 2016, he paid $7 billion to $8 billion to buy roughly 10% of four airline companies (United, American, Delta, and Southwest). Berkshire's share of their earnings was roughly $1 billion, which he thought was likely to rise over the long term. But he said, ""That was my mistake,"" showing a slide that implied most of the $6.5 billion of equities Berkshire sold in April were airline stocks. The business is notoriously difficult, which Buffett acknowledged in May. But it makes you wonder...
