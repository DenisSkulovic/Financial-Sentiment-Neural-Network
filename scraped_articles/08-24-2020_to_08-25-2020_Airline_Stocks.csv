0,"Airline stocks: Buy Delta once travel demand normalizes, trader says","One airline stock is ‘simply the best’ once air travel demand normalizes, trader says. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips.","Airline stocks are taking off again on a rush of hopeful news. The JETS global airlines ETF rallied more than 5% to begin the week after American Airlines announced use of a new disinfectant approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and Delta said it has plans to restart 50 international flights this winter. Despite the moves, Strategic Wealth Partners President Mark Tepper is still avoiding the space. “I don’t own any airline stocks right now. I just quite frankly don’t have the stomach to trade those day in and day out, but number one thing on my radar that I’m watching is the TSA ‘throughput’ traffic numbers,” Tepper told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Monday. The Transportation Security Administration says the number of travelers passing through airport checkpoints fell 74% in July compared with last year. Tepper would consider air travel to have “normalized” once that drop narrows to a 25% year-over-year decline.  “Now, my favorite airline which would be my buy when things normalize is Delta and they’re just simply the best — best management team, best maintenance team — which improves their margins. And their partnership with American Express is the gold standard for any of these rewards programs. It literally drops money straight to the bottom line,” said Tepper. Delta has rebounded 70% since May lows. It remains 52% below January highs. Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, says it’s hard to bet against the airlines given their large swing higher. However, he’s not ready to back any.  One name he says could be used for a short-term trade on upward momentum is Southwest Airlines.  “This isn’t a recommendation to buy Southwest Airlines, but I will set up the trade for those interested. It has stabilized and is trying to base out since its March bottom. You see counter-trend strength into I believe $42, which is resistance at its 200-day average, as long as support at its 50-day [average] is upheld. That’s at $33, so that’s your stop level,” Wald said during the same “Trading Nation” segment.  Southwest rallied more than 6% on Monday, closing the day at $36.91 a share. A move to $42 implies 14% upside.   Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

1,Airline Stocks Are Taking Off. Expect Turbulence. | Barron's,Airline Stocks Are Taking Off. Expect Turbulence.. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily. Here’s BofA’s List of 4 Enterprise Software Stocks,"  Airline stocks were flying Monday on hopes for a coronavirus vaccine and data indicating that the recent surge in U.S. cases has tapered off, potentially leading to a boost in travel demand this fall. Shares of American Airlines Group (ticker: AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and United Airlines (UAL) were each up more than 7%, ahead of the 5.3% gain in the NYSE Arca Airline Index. Carriers such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Southwest Airlines (LUV), and JetBlue Airways (JBLU) were all ahead by at least 5%. The stocks appear to be rallying in response to news that new coronavirus cases in the U.S. are down 22% from two weeks ago, after surging in July. Also boosting the shares is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decision, disclosed over the weekend, to grant emergency approval to convalescent plasma for hospitalized Covid patients. A report that AstraZeneca’s (AZN) vaccine candidate could get U.S. fast-track approval has given stocks an additional lift. Airlines’ revenue and traffic have yet to rebound from the crisis in a major way. Domestic traffic is hovering about 70% below last year’s levels, albeit with some recent daily gains. Airlines are slashing schedules for the fall, expecting a seasonal drop in leisure travel, while business travel remains largely on the sidelines. And international travel remains sharply depressed, partly due to quarantine requirements or bans on U.S. travelers in Canada, Europe, and other regions. According to UBS, domestic airline revenue is still down 78% from last year’s levels. Revenue yield—the average fare airlines collect for carrying a paying customer a mile—is down around 33%, on average. And though traffic this fall is expected to be less depressed than it was during the summer, the trend is worsening, October yields are expected to be down 18.8% year over year, compared to an expected 16.8% decline based on data from last week. September revenue yields are expected to be down 26.4%, versus an expected 23.4% decline a week ago. Fares remain wobbly. Cowen’s fare tracker, based on published prices from American, Delta and United, indicates that the average fare was $283 for the week ended Aug. 17. That’ is up 1.7% year over year, but it is down from an average of $303 in early July. Airlines are also planning deep cuts to their capacity and in staffing in October, That is when their payroll support under the Cares Act","Aug 24, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airlines-vaccine-stocks-coronavirus-fda-plasma-51598290726

Meanwhile, management at United Airlines UAL announced that the company intends to increase services to Shanghai after the Chinese aviation authority permitted U.S. carriers to double its flight operations to the nation. Upon China’s nod to the increased frequency, the U.S. Department of Transportation also allowed Chinese airlines to increase flights to the United States from four weekly round-trips to eight. Meanwhile, American Airlines AAL announced its plans to suspend flights to 15 U.S. airports in October as air-travel demand continues to be weak due to the ongoing coronavirus concerns. Also, per a CNBC report, Delta Air Lines DAL intends to furlough 1,941 of its pilots if a suitable cost-cutting agreement is not reached with the concerned labor union in October due to continued softness in air-travel demand. Notably, the federal aid to the airlines including Delta prohibits them from laying off employees until Sep 30, 2020. Read the Last Airline Stock Roundup here 1. Management at currently Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) Southwest Airlines stated that booking trends for September have improved modestly. For the third quarter of 2020, this low-cost carrier expects capacity to fall 30-35% from the previous estimate of a 20-30% decline.

This optimism is likely overblown. By: Stephanie Bedard-Chateauneuf | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. The S&P 500 hit another all-time high Monday, as optimism surrounding a Covid-19 treatment and vaccine drove stocks higher, especially travel companies. David Rainey, co-portfolio manager of the Hennessy Focus Fund, said: The market is now working out well into next year — expecting a vaccine or several, a couple of important therapeutic remedies as well, probably continued government aid, and people going back to work and children going back to school. Cruise and airline stocks have rallied on hopes for a sooner-than-expected vaccine, which is expected to boost travel demand. The Transportation Security Administration said Sunday was the second busiest day of travel since the pandemic. Market sentiment was supported by news that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued emergency authorization for the use of convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19. The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration wants to speed up AstraZeneca’s (LON:AZN) experimental vaccine with emergency use authorization. This would bypass various regulatory requirements and potentially put a vaccine on the market ahead of the November presidential election. Declining Covid-19 cases are also boosting travel stocks. The United States reported 34,567 new cases on Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The reading is down from 44,572 on Saturday and was the lowest daily addition in more than two months.

Be a frequent flyer as a"," Compared to more famous companies like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), people tend to think of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) as a lesser competitor. As a result, SAVE stock is often left out of discussions among airline-industry investors.  That’s regrettable as the value proposition of SAVE stock is highly compelling right now. Just because Spirit is a “discount” airline doesn’t mean that the company isn’t competitive. There’s no guarantee whatsoever that SAVE stock will quickly recover from the fiscal impact of the novel coronavirus. Long-term shareholders might have to wait until 2021 before they can get back to the break-even point, unfortunately. On the other hand, bold investors might take a chance on Spirit as recent data suggests a pickup in domestic airline travel. This, along with the company’s forward-thinking cost-cutting measures, should reassure investors that SAVE stock is ready for takeoff. For the time being, admittedly, SAVE stock is merely taxiing down the runway. Even prior to the onset of the coronavirus, SAVE shares were in a relentless state of decline. After peaking at the $64 level in late 2018, SAVE stock had descended to the $43 area by early February of this year. That’s when Covid-19 wreaked havoc on the stock market and there was no soft landing for SAVE investors. The share price bottomed out at the 52-week low of $7.01, but there was some recovery afterwards and SAVE stock closed near $17 on Aug. 21. Value-focused investors could view this as a rare opportunity to buy the shares at a deep discount. But whether it’s really a discount depends on the outlook for the company and, just as importantly, the airline industry in general. Does the data suggest that there’s hope on the horizon? SAVE investors should remain confident as recent data does indeed indicate a pickup in flying activity, at least domestically. Specifically, in August the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recorded five consecutive days in which TSA airport staff had screened more than 700,000 daily passengers. As a point of reference, we can compare this to late April’s domestic travel volumes. Believe it or not, during that time, the number of daily screened passengers fell below 100,000.

By Amanda Collins Recovering from the pandemic crisis, most airlines across the world would focus on a singular objective - return to profitability as soon as possible. Other priorities include repayment of loans, taking back control of board seats, landing slots, frequent flyer programs, and perhaps even return to share buyback programs. One aspect of aviation that will suffer for the next several years is innovation. In a rush to survive and grow, the innovations of today that could be the foundation for further enhancements in the future would suffer a great deal. The only exception could be the Gulf carriers and Singapore Airlines, which does not have to worry about loans as governments with deep pockets own them. Over the years, aided by surging air travel demand, airlines invested heavily in new technologies, improving passenger comfort, crew training, and upgrading aircraft. With the pandemic crisis expected to wipe off $419 billion in revenue for 2020, airlines will be in a dire situation to do more with less. Strong balance sheet combined with easy access to credit on ridiculously low-interest rates enabled airlines to experiment on innovations in better equipment, efficiency, passenger comfort, gourmet meals, internet connectivity, and digitization. Some of the innovations, such as high-speed entertainment and connectivity, full-scale shower facility, virtual windows for middle seats, and sensor mount fuel-efficient engines, were a result of manufacturers, airlines, and airports not needing to worry about the state of the business. Most major US carriers posted a profit for 8-10 years, which prompted even legendary investor Warren Buffet to invest in airline stocks, which he otherwise shunned for decades. Read: Top 4 Airlines That Will Survive the Covid-19 Crisis No Matter What The current pandemic crisis has not only pushed the aviation industry back by several years in terms of capacity but also on the innovation front. For most airlines, when it is time to cut staff, the first set of people to go are R&D and, special projects in addition to operations, and non-technical staff. Innovation will get hurt, not just from an airline and airport perspective. Aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, and Embraer, are key drivers of innovation in the aviation industry. Hit by cancelations and delayed deliveries, these manufacturers are likely to focus less on innovation and more on survival and growth. Airports, unlike airlines, received little support from governments to tide","Aug 24, 2020",https://www.rateacabincrew.com/blog/post/innovation-in-aviation-industry-faces-setback

Is,"      Adam Othman | August 24, 2020 | More on: AC Warren Buffett has spent 2020 perplexing investors and analysts left, right, and centre. The current financial environment is challenging on all fronts due to the pandemic – something we will remember in history as a significant black sheep event. Buffett has made things more confusing by being seemingly uncharacteristic with his investment decisions. The Oracle of Omaha stayed away from airline stocks for several decades. He referred to airlines as a disaster for capital, long before disaster struck in the form of this global health crisis. Despite his statement on airlines, he became one of the leading investors in four different airlines by 2019. His stance on airlines changed last year, and he said, “They’re like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way. The hope is they will keep orders in reasonable relationship to potential demand.” All that changed when the pandemic struck and crushed every airline company in the world. The CEO of Air Canada (TSX:AC) said that the current crisis is worse than 9/11, SARS, or the crisis of ‘08 combined for airlines. Amid the initial panic surrounding COVID-19, Buffett retained his positions in airlines. He said that he would not sell airlines back in March 2020. A few months after making the statements in support of airlines, he reduced his airline positions entirely. For someone known for making long-term bets, his divestment in airlines was a strange move. And it’s not just the airlines, either. Buffett has remained bearish about investing in general for the past several months. He just continues to stockpile an increasing amount of cash like he expects another major market meltdown that could possibly be worse than the March bottom. The year 2020 has been rough on Air Canada stockholders. The airline has become quite cheap for investors who have held shares for a long time. Many investors still consider it an excellent long-term buy due to the massive discount it is trading for on the stock market. Any company that was soaring the skies for a long time but is trading for a low price can seem attractive to value investors. There is always the chance of upside to owning high-quality stocks with substantial intrinsic value. However, investors need to be wary of Air Canada.

Investor sentiments were lifted on Sunday after the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency authorization for using convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19.

Such an action would bypass regulatory standards and potentially introduce a vaccine to the US market before November's presidential election.

Bloomberg reported Sunday night that the White House had reassured companies they can continue doing business with Tencent-owned WeChat in China even after the app is banned in the US. Senior officials in the administration reportedly realized that a blanket ban would have a major impact on the tech, communications, and gaming industries, among others, according to Bloomberg. Monday's gains place the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite at new highs following a Friday climb. The former index broke through its previous peak last week on the back of better-than-expected economic data and strong earnings from retail giants including Home Depot and Target.

Microsoft, Facebook, and Alphabet also gained. Travel stocks including Delta Air Lines, United, Carnival Cruises, and Royal Caribbean jumped on news of the potential treatments. Cruise and airline stocks have similarly rallied on hopes for a sooner-than-expected vaccine, as such a drug would likely boost travel demand near its pre-pandemic high.

Investors betting on travel activity to rebound saw a weekend full of optimistic news before trading began on Monday. The US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency authorization on Sunday for the use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19. The move comes after calls from President Donald Trump to expedite treatment approvals. Separately, the Financial Times reported Sunday the administration is looking to fast-track AstraZeneca's experimental coronavirus vaccine with an emergency use authorization. Doing so would avoid various regulatory standards and potentially bring a vaccine to market before November's presidential election.  Airlines touched double-digit gains in the morning before retracing some of their climbs. United Airlines and American Airlines both rocketed more than 10% at intraday highs, while Delta Air Lines leaped as much as 9.3%.

Carnival soared 10.5% at intraday highs. Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean jumped as much as 10.6% and 6%, respectively. In all, travel stocks were among the biggest winners in Monday trading. The aforementioned names typically rally on news of a vaccine or treatment arriving sooner than expected. Yet recent case data suggests the names have an increasingly stable foundation to rest on. The US reported 34,567 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The reading is down from 44,572 on Saturday and is the lowest daily addition in more than two months. Daily new cases have landed below 50,000 for nine days straight.  Other markets rallied in part on hopes for near-term resumption of travel activity. Oil futures jumped, with West Texas Intermediate crude trading as much as 1.3% higher, to $42.89 per barrel.
