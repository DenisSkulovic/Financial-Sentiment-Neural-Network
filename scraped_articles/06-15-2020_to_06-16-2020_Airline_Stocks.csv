1,Airline Stocks Fall as Carriers Take More Federal Aid | Barron's,Airline Stocks Fall as Carriers Take More Federal Aid. IPO of AI-Lending Firm Upstart Gains 47%. ,"  Airline stocks fell amid signs that some carriers will need additional bailout funding to make it through the crisis. United Airlines Holdings (ticker: UAL) said Monday that it expects to have $17 billion in cash and liquidity at the end of the third quarter, partly thanks to an additional $5 billion in a federally backed loan through the Cares Act. The airline secured the loan by pledging its MileagePlus program as collateral and said it had secured a total of $9.5 billion in funding through the federal loan program. United... Shares of Upstart Holdings rose as much as 50% in its first day of trading. The stock opened at $26, hit a high of $30.01 and closed Wednesday at $29.47, up 47.35%.

2,Airlines Are Getting a Grip on Coronavirus. Their Stocks Are Rising. | Barron's,Airline Stocks Are Rising Because They May Be Getting a Grip on the Coronavirus Era. . . Carriers such as,"    Airlines are finding creative ways to finance operations, flights are resuming to mainland China, and carriers are toughening rules on passengers wearing masks. They all indicate that the industry is adjusting to travel in the coronavirus era, and they are positive developments for the stocks. United Airlines Holdings (ticker: UAL) on Monday outlined details of its lucrative MileagePlus program, which it is using as collateral for $5 billion in financing through lending arms of Goldman Sachs, Barclays Bank and Morgan Stanley. Shares of United were up 5% Tuesday to around $41. The NYSE Arca Airline Index was ahead by 3.2%. United generates cash from the program in part by receiving royalty fees from its banking partner, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which pays United to convert travelers on the airline into credit-card customers. The program overall generated $5.3 billion in cash flow from sales in 2019, United said, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $1.8 billion, a 34% operating margin. United valued the program at $21.9 billion, based on a multiple of 12 times 2019 Ebitda. Such programs are one of the key ways that airlines make money. Cowen analyst Helane Becker notes that the asset generates 12% of United’s revenue and 26% of adjusted Ebitdar, a metric that adds rent cost to Ebitda. The company’s 100 million MileagePlus members account for 50% of United’s total flight revenues, and revenue from members has grown 18% faster than for nonmembers over the last five years. United said it is seeing positive trends in ticket demand with June passenger revenue expected to be up 400%, compared with April. Demand is strong domestically, and in a few international markets. Becker has a Market Perform rating on United and a target of $30 for the stock price. Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi viewed the mileage deal favorably, though he maintained a Hold rating on the stock and $39 price target. The deal makes it more likely that United won’t resort to restructuring through Chapter 11 to survive the crisis, he wrote. Assuming the mileage financing is successful, United will end the third quarter with $17 billion in cash and funding. “That provides sufficient liquidity, in our view, for United to survive most of 2021 even in a very low revenue environment,” DeNardi said. Carriers such as Delta Air Lines (DAL), JetBlue Airlines (JBLU), and Alaska Air (ALK) may now follow","Jun 16, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airlines-are-getting-a-grip-on-coronavirus-era-3-positive-signs-51592329465
3,3 Airline Stocks That Will Profit From Europe's Reopening | InvestorPlace,"3 Airline Stocks That Will Profit From Europe’s Reopening. As air travel in Europe picks up for the summer, these"," Source: Shutterstock Airline stocks have benefitted from new flight schedules — further evidence that the U.S. is on the road to a post-pandemic recovery. The sector has enjoyed a roughly 12% bump as investors cheered every sign of demand rebound. Now that American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has revealed plans to grow its summer schedule, the optimism regarding a return to travel has more or less been priced in. With most estimates still pegging the return to 2019 traffic levels at 2023 at the earliest, investors should remain cautious on the sector. Sanjiv Sabherwal, Goolsby-Fouse Endowed Chair, distinguished teaching professor and chair of the department of economics and real estate at the University of Texas at Arlington, wrote in an email to InvestorPlace that, “Hospitality, transportation, and retail are three of the hardest-hit sectors of the economy. Consequently, we are seeing many hotels, restaurants, airlines, and retailers cut dividends. This trend is likely to continue in the near future.” With that said, there’s still room to ride the recovery in airline stocks. You just have to be willing to gamble on international travel. Domestic travel is likely to be the first to return as the public gingerly tests the boundaries of a lockdown-free lifestyle. International travel will probably take more time — not only because the public has to consent to it, but also because of border regulations which will take time to soften as lawmakers try to avoid a second novel coronavirus wave. Travel in Europe is one place to start. Why? Flights within the continent can easily be compared to domestic U.S. flights. Here’s a look at three carriers that will benefit tremendously from Europe reopening.  YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  If there’s one company that will deliver to its investors in a time of crisis, it’s low-cost Irish airline Ryanair. CEO Michael O’Leary has become famous for angering everyone from his crew to his passengers in the name of shareholders. The pandemic is no different. But love him or hate him, investors have to commend O’Leary for the fact that he runs a tight ship. Ryanair is arguably one of the best European airlines because of its ultra-low debt and focus on profit.

6,Why Airline Shares Are Flying High Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Flying High Today. Positive news on the economic and COVID-19 fronts has investors buying into the,"   Airline shares got a lift Tuesday along with the broader markets on encouraging news about a treatment for COVID-19 and a renewed effort by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy. Airlines need a recovery, and with it a rebound in travel demand, to weather the pandemic crisis, and the headlines on Tuesday were positive steps in that direction. Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) opened up 13.8% on Tuesday, while shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) each were up 10% and shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA), and Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) were all up more than 6%. The stocks gave back some of those gains after the open, but the entire sector was still beating the market as of 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The airline business has been devastated by the pandemic, with travel demand falling more than 90% year over year at the height of the pandemic in March and April. It now appears that was a bottom, but the recovery will be slow and, given COVID-19 infection rates are still rising in some parts of the country, perilous. The airlines have cash to survive well into the Fall, but at some point travel demand has to return for the industry to avoid bankruptcy filings. That's likely going to require a combination of a lessening of the COVID-19 risk, and government efforts to make sure the pandemic-related slowdown does not lead to a long recession. The markets were up on Tuesday on positive news on both fronts. England's top medical officer said on Twitter that a study finding a common steroid drug dexamethasone is effective in treating the coronavirus is ""the most important trial result for COVID-19 so far.""  On the economic front, the Federal Reserve late Monday announced it would be expanding its stimulus program by purchasing individual corporate bonds. The effectiveness of that form of stimulus is open to debate, but investors tend to cheer any indication that the government is devoting all available resources to avoiding a recession. Airlines are also doing what they can to encourage people to fly. A leading U.S. trade group on Tuesday announced a new, tougher enforcement policy to make sure everyone on board flights are wearing masks.

7,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,"Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. United adds to its cash stockpile ahead of what looks like a long, slow","   Airline shares were under pressure on Monday after United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) moved to shore up its balance sheet via added debt and issuing more shares. Investors are also getting nervous about a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, putting pressure on travel stocks. United shares traded down 6% as of 11 a.m. EDT, after opening down more than 10%. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) opened down 9.9% and 8%, respectively, and were each off more than 3% in late-morning trading, while Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock had made up most of its initial 6.3% decline. The airlines have been scrambling to raise cash as the pandemic slashed demand for travel. United is the latest to move, announcing Monday it plans to raise $5 billion by borrowing against its frequent flier program while also filing to issue and sell up to 28 million shares of its common stock. The efforts, coupled with receipt of $4.5 billion in U.S. Treasury loans as part of the CARES Act, should give the airline total liquidity of $17 billion by the end of September. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The added liquidity is a plus, but investors were just as focused on the data United provided highlighting why it needs the cash. In a securities filing United said it ""continues to see a steady improvement"" for domestic and certain international travel, but July domestic capacity will be down 75% year over year and ticketed passenger revenue is expected to fall by more than 80%. United expects to burn through an average of $40 million per day in the current quarter, and hopes to have that number down to $30 million per day in the third quarter. That could mean further cost-cutting; the airline says it is in negotiations with its unions concerning future staffing levels. The hope had been that after an initial pandemic-induced shock to demand in March and April travel would steadily improve through the summer and into the fall. If so the airlines should have ample liquidity to ride out the crisis. But a growing number of new cases in tourism hotspots, including Florida, Texas, and California, are worrying investors that we could face a second wave, and further demand issues, in the months to come. News that China is reintroducing lockdown measures in Beijing after a new cluster of COVID-19 cases was identified is adding","Jun 15, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/15/why-airline-shares-are-falling-today.aspx

BTC-USD.,"                                                   In the past week, American Airlines AAL grabbed headlines following the announcement that it hopes to reduce its cash burn rate to zero by Dec 31, 2020. Notably, the carrier was also in news in the previous week when it issued a bullish update on July capacity. Per Delta Air Lines DAL management, the second-quarter 2020 top line is expected to plunge 90% year over year, mainly due to the coronavirus-induced passenger revenue slump. Echoing similar sentiments, United Airlines UAL anticipates an 88% year-over-year reduction in second-quarter total revenues. Meanwhile, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY CEO Michael O’Leary reportedly said that the airline will incur a net loss in the band of €200-€300 million ($226-$339 million) for fiscal year 2021 (ending Mar 31, 2021). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. American Airlines predicts second-quarter 2020 revenues to tank approximately 90% year over year. Capacity in the period is expected to plummet roughly 75% year over year. However, owing to the recent improvement in air-travel demand alongside cost-cutting initiatives, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) projects cash-burn rate to fall to nearly $40 million per day in June from $100 million in April. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. 2 Like American Airlines, Delta hopes to reduce its average daily cash outflow to zero by 2020-end. Moreover, this Atlanta, GA-based carrier envisions the demand-recovery environment to be better on the domestic front than in the international markets. As a result, the carrier added 100 domestic flights in June. Moreover, it plans to continue adding flights in the third quarter. 3. Backed by its focus on operating cargo-only flights as passenger revenues decline in the current scenario, United Airlines expects cargo revenues to surge more than 30% year over year in the June quarter. Additionally, owing to its cost-cutting measures, this Chicago-based carrier expects second-quarter operating expenses to decrease 53% year over year. Moreover, second-quarter average daily cash-burn amount is expected to be at the lower end of the $40-$45 million guided range.

Air,"      Vineet Kulkarni | June 15, 2020 | More on: AC CHR CJT Uncertainties continued to drive airline stocks recently with volatility going through the roof. Although many Canadian airlines are gradually restarting operations, demand in short- to intermediate-term will likely be very low. So, are there any worthy opportunities for investors in the Canadian aviation space? Or should investors avoid the sector altogether? Let’s take a look. Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock lost more than 4% in yet another super-volatile last week. The country’s biggest airline is grappled with multiple challenges that might not soothe anytime soon. Air Canada seems well placed from the liquidity standpoint, which will likely help it sustain relatively longer during the pandemic. However, its high-speed cash burn on unavoidable operating expenses could make the situation direr if the demand remains lower for longer than expected. Air Canada management expects three years’ time to normalize air travel demand. Importantly, such a long period suggests lower revenues, more and more losses, and in turn, concerns over its survival. Many believe that Air Canada’s lower valuation makes it an attractive buy at the moment. However, I think surrounding uncertainties would significantly weigh on the stock in the near future. How air travel demand fares in the second half of 2020 would bring more clarity and throw some useful light on Air Canada’s future. Chorus Aviation (TSX:CHR.B) looks comparatively better from the valuation perspective. It will likely exhibit a relatively faster recovery due to its operations spread within Canadian borders and aircraft leasing business. However, Air Canada is one of its key customers, and lower demand could delay Chorus’ recovery. Also, Chorus has a huge debt pile, which may become a hindrance in case the pandemic lasts longer. Chorus stock has fallen more than 50% since its pre-pandemic levels. The stock is trading six times its 2020 earnings estimates and offers a significant discount compared to its average historical valuation. Apart from these two, air cargo operator Cargojet (TSX:CJT) offers a much sunnier outlook. The pandemic and lockdowns had a little impact on its operations recently. Interestingly, while many airline companies failed to keep up with their topline growth, Cargojet managed a superior revenue growth last quarter.

The head of London’s second-largest airport thinks the airline industry will remain under pressure for the next four years. By: Joseph Young | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. Airlines could be serious trouble over the next four years. That’s according to Stewart Wingate, the CEO of Gatwick, London’s second-largest airport. For passenger levels to return to 2019 levels, Wingate says it may take three to four years: We think it will take three to four years for Gatwick to come back to 2019 passenger volume levels. Based on research from Florida Panhandle, the breakeven passenger occupancy of leading U.S. airlines are: If it takes an additional four years for occupancy to return to 2019 levels, airlines will continue to operate at a loss.
