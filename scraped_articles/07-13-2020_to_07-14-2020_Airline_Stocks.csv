0,Low-Cost Airline Stocks Take Off From Support,"Low-Cost Airline Stocks Take Off From Support. Leisure travel supports low-cost carriers. Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE). JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU).","Ongoing international border restrictions and reduced corporate travel throughout the remainder of 2020 look likely as new coronavirus cases continue to emerge. Low-cost carriers appear better suited to operate in this turbulent environment, given their reduced exposure to foreign destinations and focus on domestic leisure markets. Travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth said that policies purchased reveal that domestic trips account for 57% of planned travel throughout the rest of 2020, up from just 12.3% over the same period last year. Meanwhile, U.S. Travel Association CEO Roger Dow believes that vacation travelers will lead the recovery. ""Our research actually says that leisure travel is going to be among the first to come back,"" he said, per The Washington Post. In recent months, budget airlines have added additional discounted flights to popular destinations to lure customers back into the skies after months of remaining cooped up at home under imposed lockdown measures. Below, we take a look at three such carriers and turn to the charts to point out possible trading opportunities. Florida-based Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE) provides low-fare airline services to around 75 destinations in the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Due to better-than-expected demand throughout the pandemic, the no-frills carrier increased its daily scheduled flights from 50 in April to more than 300 by the end of last month. Moreover, the airline plans to add additional flights throughout July to meet increased summer travel demand as coronavirus restrictions ease. However, CEO Ted Christie said that, if passenger numbers fall amid a spike in new virus infections, the budget airline will promptly cut flights. As of July 13, 2020, Spirit Airlines has a market capitalization of $1.55 billion and is trading nearly 25% higher over the past three months.  Since early June, the share price has traded within a descending triangle that finds a confluence of support from a horizontal trendline and the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). The stock rallied more than 10% from this level Friday in a move that may induce further buying in the weeks ahead. Those who buy here should consider placing a stop-loss order beneath the July low at $15.54 and booking profits on a test of the 200-day SMA. Low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU) flies to roughly 100 destinations in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

2,The Best 4 Airline Stocks to Buy Into Coronavirus Headwinds | InvestorPlace,The Best 4 Airline Stocks to Buy Into Coronavirus Headwinds. The coronavirus pandemic has taken its toll on airline stocks.," Source: Shutterstock Airline stocks face more challenges than most during the novel coronavirus pandemic, and that’s keeping CEOs awake at night. These days, the idea of traveling shoulder-to-shoulder in a metal tube (with no social distancing), isn’t the most appealing notion in the world. Business travel has also taken a big hit, as companies have widely turned to video meeting platforms where possible, rather than shunting employees from coast-to-coast for an old-fashioned sit-down in a conference room. But all is not lost. Airline traffic is starting to pick up, although it could be months or years before it returns to pre-pandemic levels. Secondly, airline stocks are massively depressed right now. That’s bad news if you held those names before the pandemic, but it’s a great opportunity for investors looking to stake a new position in a weakened industry. Here are the 4 most interesting airline stocks to watch now: Airline stocks aren’t for the faint of heart and are likely to experience lots of volatility in the months ahead. But if you’re willing to set aside some money and invest in the long term, these names could be an interesting opportunity. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  For United Airlines, the writing’s already on the wall. In fact, you could say it’s on official letterhead. United told its 36,000 employees in a series of meetings that continuing losses from the novel coronavirus pandemic may result in mass furloughs. Such a move could happen as early as Oct. 1, when staffing restrictions imposed on the company via CARES Act loans expire. The company is giving notice to 45% of United’s personnel in the U.S., including 15,000 flight attendants, 2,250 pilots and 11,000 service workers. Just two days before that announcement, United disclosed that the airline’s drop in business will continue well into the third quarter. Year-over-year capacity in June was down 88% and is projected to fall by 75% in July and 65% in August. The numbers are showing slow but steady improvement, though that’s not going to be enough to save thousands of UAL jobs. So what’s the silver lining here? UAL says it has $17 billion in liquidity, which should be ample buffer for the company to withstand a downturn that will likely stretch into 2021. Cutting payroll will help United cut costs and ideally, allow investors to see some profits.

If the cadence of healthcare data continues to support some sort of cure, the focus on ‘re-closings’ ultimately fades.”  Several states, including California, have had to roll back reopening measures as coronavirus cases continue to rise.

Solid results weren't enough to pull some stocks out","   Earnings season has officially begun, and investors can expect the stock market to see increased volatility as companies start to tell the tale of how the second quarter of 2020 went for them. Monday's big late-day sell-off left many market participants feeling a bit gun-shy about the future for stocks, but strength in areas like the energy sector helped to provide a lift in some indexes. Just before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up 173 points to 26,259. However, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) was down a point to 3,154, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) had dropped a more substantial 76 points to 10,315. Big banks are among the first companies to report their results each quarter, and the news from the financial industry was mixed Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, airline giant Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) also weighed in with its latest figures. Investors watched the news with anticipation, trying to figure out what it all means for the overall economy's direction in the remainder of 2020 and beyond. Just like the broader market, the bank stocks that reported their earnings Tuesday morning had mixed performances. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) saw its stock inch higher following its report, but Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) suffered declines. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. For JPMorgan, there was a considerable disconnect between the backward-looking results and the forward outlook. Financial performance for the second quarter showed a significant turnaround for the bank, as net income came in at $4.7 billion. Admittedly, that's down by more than half from year-ago levels, but it's a huge improvement from three months ago, and revenue was the bank's highest ever. However, JPMorgan added a whopping $10.5 billion to its loan loss provisions, and CEO Jamie Dimon said that the bank's operations ""still face much uncertainty regarding the future path of the economy."" Citigroup's results sent its stock down more than 2%. Net income, at $1.3 billion, was down around 70% year over year, but revenue had risen 5% on strength in its market and investment banking operations. Citi added $5.6 billion to its loan loss reserves, verifying a negative outlook based on poor economic conditions. For Wells Fargo the news was worse, and the stock dropped 7%.

6,5 Awful Stocks Robinhood Investors Are Buying | The Motley Fool,5 Awful Stocks Robinhood Investors Are Buying. Young investors are making a big mistake by chasing these terrible businesses.. Nikola.,"   No matter how long you've been an investor, there's simply nothing that could have prepared you for what 2020 has offered thus far. In a roughly four-month span, investors have dealt with about a decade's worth of volatility due to the unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Of course, periods of panic and heightened volatility have generally served long-term investors well. That's because every stock market correction in history (save for the current correction) has eventually been erased by a bull market rally. Buying great stocks and hanging onto them for a long period of time is a strategy with a high success rate. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. However, panic and volatility can have negative consequences, too. Online investment platform Robinhood, which has been especially successful in courting younger/millennial investors with the lure of commission-free trades and the gift of free stock once you open an account, is one such instance of the dangers that can arise during periods of heightened volatility. While some of its members have a long-term mindset, the typical ""Robinhood investor"" is a short-term trader who's usually chasing today's hottest stocks. Since predicting short-term movements can't be done with any accuracy, it's a dangerous game for young investors to be playing. Worst of all, some of the most popular stocks on the Robinhood platform are absolutely awful companies. Here are five such stocks that retail investors apparently love, but which you should avoid like the plague. THE NIKOLA BADGER ELECTRIC TRUCK. IMAGE SOURCE: NIKOLA. Being brutally honest, the entire electric vehicle (EV) industry, including NIO (NYSE:NIO), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Workhorse Group, and Tortoise Acquisition, look to be in one massive retail trader-fueled bubble. But none is priced more out of whack than Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). Short-term traders have watched Tesla and NIO defy gravity for weeks, and they simply figure that Nikola and its $20 billion market cap can do the same. After all, Nikola did unveil its Badger EV truck, and initial deposit demand following that unveil was presumed to be strong. But there's a problem here: Nikola hasn't sold a single EV or fuel-cell vehicle... ever. The company hopes to begin production of the Badger next year, but it's a veritable certainly that snags and hurdles will arise. Both Tesla and NIO have dealt with surprises of their own, such as NIO abandoning its plan to build a factory in Shanghai to make","Jul 14, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/14/5-awful-stocks-robinhood-investors-are-buying.aspx

8,Delta: The Stock's Must-Know Levels After Earnings - TheStreet,,"Delta Air Lines  (DAL) - Get Report is set to report earnings on Tuesday. Coming into the event, shares have been quite mixed. Airlines, cruise lines, casinos and other travel-oriented stocks were obliterated in March. Even once the stocks had stopped going down, many did not see much upside. They traded sideways as the market came roaring back in April. However, American Airlines  (AAL) - Get Report issued some positive news regarding bookings, which helped to launch the entire industry into a monumental rally. Despite breaking to new lows in May, Delta stock reversed hard off the $17.50 level and surged toward $37.50. The stock rallied over 100% in less than a month. But just as American, United Airlines  (UAL) - Get Report, Delta and others enjoyed a powerful rally, the stocks have also fallen into a morale-crushing pullback.  Let’s look at the charts ahead of earnings. Daily chart of Delta stock. Chart courtesy of Stockcharts.com It’s possible that Delta will set the tone for the rest of its industry when it reports. Honestly, it's good to see the stock pull back ahead of earnings. While this correction did not necessarily need to begin a month ago, it helped to drive down expectations ahead of what’s likely to be a poor result. But the result isn’t what’s important, it’s the reaction that matters now. As shares cling to the backside of prior downtrend resistance (blue line) and the 50-day moving average, bulls want to see Delta stock hold $25 after it reports earnings. That level comes into play just below last week’s low. A close below that mark could send Delta into the low-$20s, where it found multi-month support from March through May, with the exception of that three-day breakdown that sent it to new lows. On the upside, bulls would love to see shares clear $30. That would put it above the 23.6% retracement at $28.02, as well as the 20-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages. In that event, it will put the 38.2% retracement in play near $34.50, as well as the June high at $37.24.  Delta stock has been a very volatile name lately and with good reason. While many consider it the best airline stock, it will continue to have some turbulence. Watch the levels after it reports and see which direction grabs momentum.

JPMorgan Chase kicked off earnings season on a high note, though Wells Fargo and Delta reported quarterly results that missed consensus expectations. The Nasdaq trailed the S&P 500 and Dow as a tech-led rally from the past couple weeks lost steam. [Click here to read what’s moving markets heading into Wednesday, July 15] In earnings results Tuesday morning, each of JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported adding billions to their credit loss reserves during the fiscal second quarter, as the companies braced for the coronavirus pandemic to threaten their consumer and corporate customers’ abilities to repay loans. This undercut the banks’ profit during the quarter, even as trading-related revenue surged strongly for both JPMorgan and Citigroup amid the market rally since the mid-March lows. Still, bank executives issued words of caution in their quarterly earnings releases, with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that the bank still “face[s] much uncertainty regarding the future path of the economy.” “However, we are prepared for all eventualities as our fortress balance sheet allows us to remain a port in the storm,” he added. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf, for his part, said the bank’s “view of the length and severity of the economy downturn has deteriorated considerably from the assumptions used last quarter,” as the bank slashed its quarterly dividend and swung to its first loss in more than a decade. Disappointing results from Delta Air Lines also underscored the misery for companies in the hardest-hit industries during the pandemic. The company’s staggering 94% drop in passenger revenues came as the company slashed capacity by 85%. Its average daily cash burn was $43 million as of June, which while an improvement from March, came only after the company parked more than 700 aircraft to adjust to the drop in demand.

13,COVID-19: Will AirAsia be the next airline to fold?,COVID-19: Will AirAsia be the next airline to fold?. . ,"  SINGAPORE : The fascinating story of AirAsia's rise to become one of the most admired carriers in the region is well known in Southeast Asia. It began with the purchase of the bankrupt airline from Malaysian government conglomerate DRB- Hicom back in December 2001 by legendary and flamboyant founder, Tony Fernandes. It was a gutsy move so soon after the September 11 tragedy in America which devasted the airline industry. Although he ostensibly paid 1 Malaysian Ringgit (now 23 US cents) for the airline, he had to take on USD 11 million of debt and in order to finance the operations, he had to mortgage his house and plough his entire savings into the venture since no banks would lend him money as he had no prior experience running an airline. Before taking this big spin of the roulette wheel, he had a cushy high-flying job as a Warner Music executive which he joined as an accountant. He and business partner and old friend, co-founder Kamarudin Meranun, took over two ageing Boeing 737-330 planes and 200 staff after the acquisition and were profitable within one year, flying 200,000 passengers in 2002. Five years later in 2007, they had 68 planes, another 175 on order, and had 5,000 people working for the airline. They flew 23 million passengers that year. That is more passengers than SIA (Singapore Airlines), MAS (Malaysian Airlines), Thai Airways, Emirates or Cathay. By 2017, it was operating with 220 aircraft, employed 20,000 people, and was carrying 65 million passengers annually. As of 2019, AirAsia had the enviable achievement of winning Skytrax's world's best low-cost carrier for 11 consecutive years in their international travel and airline awards. AirAsia took on a low-cost carrier business model with a slogan that resonated with regional travellers: ""Now everyone can fly"". It inspired the birth of many Southeast Asian low-cost airlines like SIA's Tiger Airways (now merged with Scoot), Jetstar Asia, Indonesia's Lion Air and Air Mandala, Philippines' Cebu Pacific and Thailand's Nok Air. Starting in 2004 with Thai AirAsia, the airline started its regional expansion by establishing joint-ventures or other forms of partnerships in various countries including Indonesia, Philippines, Japan and India. Their affiliate in China was closed not long after starting for commercial reasons. Its airline in India is a joint venture which started in 2013. It owns 49 percent of the venture, with Tata Sons and Arun","Jul 13, 2020",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/covid-19-will-airasia-be-the-next-airline-to-fold-11594616793641.html

15,Stock investing: When to shift to value from growth companies,These ignored stocks may be poised to rebound. Recession gives way to recovery. Highfliers come back to earth. Value gets,"Buying so-called value stocks at bargain-basement prices has netted sub-par returns for more than a decade. The big winners have been popular growth stocks like Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix that keep going up despite selling at much higher valuations. But don’t count out the market’s diamonds in the rough just yet, Wall Street fund managers and investment strategists say. These ignored stocks could be poised to play catch-up. Value investing is buying stocks that are trading at low valuations relative to earnings, book value and sales. Buying stocks at lower prices is a good indicator that they’ll deliver higher future returns than more expensive stocks, says Wes Crill, senior researcher and VP at Dimensional Fund Advisors. “This is one of the best times in history to buy value relative to growth,” adds Dave Iben, chief investment officer at Kopernik Global Investors. “You’re really getting bargains on companies people don’t like. Now is the time to take advantage.”  Tax tips:2020 tax deadline is around the corner. Here are 4 tips for filing by July 15 Recession stocks:Looking to help your investments in a recession? Experts recommend these stocks Value stocks he likes include China Telecom, General Electric (which once was the most valuable company in the U.S. but has fallen on tough times), and natural gas company Range Resources. “A lot of value stocks are selling at half of what we think they’re worth,” Iben says.  “If we’re right,"" Iben says, ""they will double.” Value stocks can sell at steep discounts for a variety of reasons. They can go on sale because of a short-term business hiccup, a public relations crisis, a CEO change, movements in interest rates, economic slowdowns, or overly pessimistic investors pricing them too low. Value sectors include financials, health care, industrials, and different types of consumer-facing companies. Part of the current appeal of beaten-down value stocks is that they’re now cheaper compared to their growth counterparts than they’ve been in a very long time. Value stocks, as measured by their price-to-book ratio (i.e. what the company would be worth if liquidated), are trading at their lowest valuations relative to growth in at least 20 years, according to Bank of America (BofA). “Value is inexpensive,” says Jill Carey Hall, an equity strategist at BofA.

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Bryce Elder G4S has a whole “controversies surrounding . . .” Wikipedia page. Weighing in at ~7,000 words and with 84 references, G4S’s Wiki “controversies surrounding . . .” rap sheet is longer than the ones for the Legion of Christ and Grand Theft Auto V, though not quite as long as Silvio Berlusconi’s. But, Mr Berlusconi having recently been decommissioned, G4S can still catch up. At the time of writing for instance, its Wiki entry on tag fraud was last updated in 2014 so will need some attention, because: G4S has agreed to pay a £44m fine over its contract for electronic tagging of prisoners as the UK’s Serious Fraud Office said the outsourcer had “repeatedly lied” to the Ministry of Justice. The SFO on Friday said G4S Care and Justice — a wholly owned subsidiary of G4S that has accepted responsibility for three cases of fraud — had misled the government about the true extent of profits earned between 2011 and 2013 for the prisoner tagging contract. The deal draws to a close the bulk of the SFO’s seven-year investigation into G4S and Serco over tagging contracts after Serco agreed to pay a £19.2m fine last year to settle three offences of fraud and two for false accounting between 2010 and 2013. Shareholders always like the idea of things drawing to a close, so G4S is up 10 per cent or thereabouts. It helps also that according to the BBC, G4S is preferred bidder on Wellinborough “mega prison” -- worth about £300m over 10 years -- which suggests the government’s approach to contract tendering remains Homeric. A third positive comes via a short, unscheduled trading update in which G4S says it “has continued to deliver a resilient trading performance during June” so expects first-half results to be “significantly above market consensus”. Here’s Bank of America: We had modelled £40m in our estimates and our sense is investors were factoring in £40-50m. The fine is as expected, however we believe this removes a long-standing overhang for the business. ... [W]e think that the news . . . is a step towards abating concern around: 1) Cash generation: we expect this to improve in coming years ""one-off"" cash items (eg. SFO fine) reduce; and 2) Negative earnings surprises: We believe that the refined and simplified portfolio will now yield lower earnings volatility and perhaps higher visibility. And Panmure: we think that security","Jul 13, 2020",http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/07/13/1594633959000/Markets-Now---Monday-13th-July-2020/
