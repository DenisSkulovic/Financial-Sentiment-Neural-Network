Some believe that it may take at least two years or longer for the aviation industry to bounce back to pre-COVID levels.    A handful of airliners have suspended their dividend payouts and some have even filed for bankruptcy protection. Notably, shares of some of the premier airliners, including United Airlines Holdings, Inc. UAL, Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE and American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, have tanked more than 50% so far this year.   But thankfully, things have started to look up for airlines of late. In fact, airline shares took off on Aug 10 on tell-tale signs that travel may finally be picking up. The U.S. Global Jets ETF surged 4.8% yesterday, with all of its U.S.-listed components gaining traction. Similarly, the NYSE Arca Airline Index was up nearly 5%, with investors mostly appearing to view the travel demand trend as a solid reason to boost stocks.   The Transport Security Administration (TSA) reported that 831,789 passengers passed through the TSA checkpoints on Aug 9, the highest single-day total since Mar 17.   Now, one-day data may not signal a trend but the averages have also been rising at a steady level, touching nearly 700,000 daily commuters in the recent seven-day period, up from 661,000 three weeks ago. On Aug 8, TSA screened 683,212 people and on Aug 7, they screened 762,547 passengers at checkpoints throughout the nation.   Moreover, the latest TSA data indicated a significant uptick in air travel demand. After all, at the worst level, on Apr 14, only 87,534 travelers went through the TSA checkpoints, down 96% from a year ago.   By the way, airline stocks are positioned to gain momentum as the latest coronavirus case count shows signs of a declining trend.

5,"U.S. airline stocks hit highest prices since June on travel uptick, stimulus hopes",U.S. airline stocks ease off of multi-week highs as S&P 500 gives up gains. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"U.S. airline stocks Tuesday hit their highest prices since mid-June, but the rally, led by more customers returning to air travel and hopes for more government aid, cooled along with the broader market. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines hit their highest prices since June 19. American Airlines topped its highest share price since June 22 and Southwest Airlines rose to the highest since June 16. The broader S&P 500 was up for most of the session, but slipped in late-afternoon trading. Airline shares have had a strong start to the week after federal data showed more people passing through U.S. airports. On Sunday alone, the Transportation Security Administration screened 831,789 people, the most since March 17. “We continue to believe there is coronavirus fatigue with some now looking to get back to normal life,” wrote Cowen airline analyst Helane Becker on Tuesday. “We expect to see TSA throughput trend higher this week probably helped in part by college students returning to their schools.” Despite the uptick in travel, those numbers are down by about 70% from a year ago, showing airlines still have a way to go before returning to normal demand levels for the peak summer season. Political support has also grown for $25 billion in additional federal support for airline payrolls, helping lift airlines’ stock prices. The aid largely depends on whether lawmakers and the White House reach a deal for a broader coronavirus stimulus package. Even with the recent rally, airlines’ shares are down sharply this year. Delta is down 49% year-to-date, United has lost 58% and American is down 52% since the end of last year. Southwest is down 35% since Dec. 31, less than the others since it has a U.S.-focused network, unlike its larger competitors who have suffered from the pandemic’s impact on international travel.

7,UAL: The CONTRARIAN CASE for Airline Stocks,The CONTRARIAN CASE for Airline Stocks. . . About the Author: Jaimini Desai. More Resources for the Stocks in this,"  UAL – Airline stocks are poised for a massive, countertrend rally in the coming weeks. The market is rotating into lagging sectors, case counts are falling, and recent research shows that flying on planes is surprisingly safe. United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), and Spirit Air (SAVE) will have the biggest rallies. Aug 10, 2020  Airline stocks are due for a multi week, countertrend rally. Not all stocks have been winners since the stock market’s recovery off its March lows. Sectors like technology, real estate/construction, and healthcare have raced off to new highs. In contrast, airlines and hotels have lagged. The coronavirus has led to a surge in sales and profits for winning sectors, while it’s crushed demand for the laggards. 9 Simple Strategies to GROW Your Portfolio For example, second-quarter revenue for US-based airlines was down between 80 to 90%. The airlines also were forced to cut costs by reducing the number of flights, selling old airplanes, and offering workers early retirement bonuses. Intriguing Opportunity The negatives for airline stocks are reflected in their underperformance relative to the broader market. From June to August, the US Global Jets ETF (JETS) fell 31%. This followed a more than 65% decline in JETS during the coronavirus crash.  In between, the sector had a 95% rally from mid-May to June as the economy started to reopen, case counts declined, and there was growing optimism that the worst was behind us. However, there was another surge in coronavirus infections from June to August which resulted in the sector giving up 50% of these gains. Improving Outlook There are several signs on the horizon that the outlook is improving for the sector. While many parts of the market are making new highs, JETS remains nearly 50% off its pre-coronavirus levels. Given extreme bearish sentiment and the recent positive developments, investors should position themselves for a multi week, countertrend rally that will take airline stocks above their June highs. The best airline stocks to play for a countertrend rally are Spirit Airlines (SAVE), American Airlines (AAL), and United Airlines (UAL). UAL, AAL, and SAVE have very high levels of short interest. This will lead to even bigger rallies as shorts will be squeezed and forced to cover. Double Bottom The first clue is that the sector has formed a double bottom. This creates a low-risk, entry point.  It’s also remarkably","Aug 10, 2020",https://stocknews.com/news/ual-jets-save-aal-the-contrarian-case-for-airline-stocks/

9,4 Airline Stocks To Leave On The Runway AAL DLAKY | InvestorPlace,4 Airline Stocks To Leave On The Runway. Investors should avoid these airline stocks until the global pandemic is behind," Source: Shutterstock When it comes to airline stocks, the news seems to be going from bad to worse. Earlier this week, British airline Virgin Atlantic filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in U.S. federal bankruptcy court after proceeding with a similar filing in the United Kingdom. Virgin Atlantic joins other carriers such as Chile’s LATAM (OTCMTKS:LTMAQ), German Airways and RavnAir, Alaska’s largest regional airline, in filing for bankruptcy. According to International Air Transport Association, the novel coronavirus pandemic will cost airlines $419 billion in lost revenues this year as global demand remains down 54% from 2019. U.S.-based airlines have warned that as many as 70,000 jobs in the sector could be eliminated this fall when a current round of federal aid expires. President Donald Trump recently expressed his support for providing American carriers with an additional $25 billion to help them survive and retain employees. The additional aid for airlines is gaining some bipartisan support in Congress, but is by no means a done deal. Regardless of the outcome in Washington, D.C., many more airlines around the world are forecast to file for bankruptcy between now and the end of 2021. Given the dire situation facing air travel around the world, investors would be wise to avoid airline stocks for the time being. Here are four airline stocks to leave on the runway. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE American Airlines has been harder hit by the Covid-19 downturn than any other U.S.-based carrier. For the second quarter, American Airlines reported that its revenue plunged 86%, leading to a $2 billion loss between April and June. While other major U.S. airlines reported similar losses in the second quarter, American’s situation is complicated by the fact that it is the largest carrier in the world with the most international routes and the biggest fixed costs. During the second quarter, American Airlines averaged daily losses of $55 million, compared with $43 million for Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), $40 million for United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and $23 million for Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). Exacerbating problems for American Airlines is also its debt load. The carrier has $34 billion of debt, by far the highest among U.S. carriers and $10 billion more than the debt of rivals Delta and United. American Airlines recently warned 25,000 employees that they are at risk of being furloughed starting Oct. 1 unless more government aid is","Aug 11, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/08/4-airline-stocks-to-leave-on-the-runway-aal-dlaky/
10,Should You Buy Airline Stock Right Now? - Young and Thrifty,Should You Buy Airline Stock Right Now?. Is Investing in Airline Stocks a Good Idea?. Airline Stocks and Volatility. How,"Written by Robb Engen Modified date: August 10, 2020 As investors cope with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, many traders are looking to capitalize on stocks they expect to thrive in our “new normal”. The aviation industry was hit particularly hard by COVID-19, but in the past few months, we’ve seen airlines become some of the most traded and profitable stocks on the market. If you’re interested in investing in airline stocks, keep reading to learn about the best airline stocks to buy and how to invest in the best airline ETFs and stocks.    In This Article: Historically, airlines have been some of the worst businesses to own. Indeed, the list of major airlines that have ceased operations or reorganized under bankruptcy protection is long. How bad has it been for airline investors? As billionaire investor Warren Buffett famously said, “If a far-sighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting Orville down.” A global pandemic further highlighted the many challenges facing the aviation industry. While global markets collapsed due to COVID-19, individual airline stocks were nearly wiped-out. Canada’s TSX stock market bottomed out on March 23, 2020, with a 32% drop. At the same time, Canada’s top airline, Air Canada (TSX: AC), had fallen nearly 75% on the year.  Since then, Air Canada has become one of the most widely traded stocks on the TSX and a favourite of day traders on commission-free platforms like Wealthsimple Trade and Questrade. The resulting volatility saw Air Canada stock fluctuate between $12 and $23 per share over the last three months. Note it’s still down 62% on the year. Airline stocks have been hit just as hard south of the border with U.S. airlines plunging between 60% to 75% in value throughout the coronavirus crisis. Like Air Canada on the TSX, several airlines in the U.S. have become some of the most actively traded stocks on the market. That list is led by American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Airlines – all of whose stock has seen incredible volatility in the past three months. Volatility should serve as a warning to long-term investors, but it also invites opportunity for short-term traders to profit. If airline stocks are so volatile, why would anyone buy into them? For starters, day traders are attracted to volatility like sharks are drawn","Aug 10, 2020",https://youngandthrifty.ca/best-airline-stocks-to-buy/

13,Should You Buy or Sell Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock or Other Airline Stocks Now? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Should You Buy or Sell Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock or Other Airline,"      Kay Ng | August 10, 2020 | More on: AC CHR If you’re thinking of buying Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock or other airline stocks, think again. They’re high-risk investments now. It doesn’t mean you can’t make tonnes of money from them, but real near-term risks should not be ignored. Air Canada stock delivered returns of close to 37% per year from 2014 to 2019. That is a 6.5 bagger! During that period, the U.S. stock market generated annualized total returns of close to 11%. Needless to say, an investment in Air Canada also beat the Canadian stock market, which tends to underperform the U.S. market.  Data by YCharts. Chart comparing Air Canada stock’s total returns to those of the U.S. and Canadian stock markets from 2014 to 2019. This market-beating phenomenon exists in the airline industry as a whole. The caveat is that the economy must be growing for this to take place. A partner of Air Canada’s, Chorus Aviation (TSX:CHR) delivered annualized total returns of about 18% from 2014 to 2019. The difference between investments in Chorus Aviation and Air Canada stock is that much of the former’s returns — about 41% — came from its dividends. At least, it used to. The stock suspended its dividend in April, as the pandemic tsunami swept through the industry, leaving no airline unharmed. In late 2019, before the dividend cut, Chorus Aviation yielded about 6%. Whenever dividend stocks yield 6% or higher in a normal market, investors should ask why the stocks provide an above average yield? What are the risks? The flip side of airline stocks is that they underperform when the economy contracts. Right now, it’s worse than that. Due to air travel restrictions, no thanks to COVID-19, global air travel has dropped about 50% from pre-COVID levels, according to statista. The drop in air travel could be worse in Canada, although the article indicates numbers have since improved. However, it’s too early to say air travel is on the way to a turnaround. For one thing, no one knows how long we’ll be fighting the pandemic. Experts warn that vaccines aren’t a silver bullet solution, though it’d certainly help the situation. For now, we’ll just have to stick with social distancing, hand washing, and mask wearing. Airlines are simply burning cash every day.

17,Consumer Cyclical ETFs Gain As Airlines And Hotels Surge | ETF Trends,Consumer Cyclical ETFs Gain As Airlines And Hotels Surge. RELATED TOPICS. FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER. SUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE DAILY NEWSLETTER!.,"The consumer cyclical sector was booming on Monday, as stocks like Marriott International, the Las Vegas Sands Corp., and airlines were up big as technology stocks fell. After falling steeply following a quarterly loss of $0.64 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.44, Marriott International roared back on Monday, helping to lead the consumer cyclical charge higher, which boosted the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCF) and iShares US Consumer Services ETF (IYC) almost 1% apiece as well. Marriott shares gained 3.57% Monday, despite poor earnings for MAR, as Covid-19 and other factors wrought havoc on the balance sheet. The quarterly report represented an earnings upset of -45.45%. Airline shares Monday also targeted their largest one-day percentage gains in almost a month, following federal data that revealed that air travel notched its highest volume in nearly five months as well as burgeoning political support for more federal aid to assist the struggling sector. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines stocks each climbed over 7% higher in afternoon trading, while United Airlines surged more than 8%, and Southwest Airlines advanced more than 4%. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) gained almost 5% amid the moves. The tally of people passing through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints at U.S. airports advanced for another week with 831,789 people on Sunday alone, reaching its loftiest level since March 17.
