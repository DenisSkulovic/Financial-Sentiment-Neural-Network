2,Is Southwest Airlines a Buy Before Earnings? | The Motley Fool,Is Southwest Airlines a Buy Before Earnings?. Expansion plans are on hold as the Boeing 737 MAX grounding is affecting,"   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all 387 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft in March after two MAX aircraft crashed within a short period, killing 346 people. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was the largest customer of the MAX, ordering 280 in total before the incidents. The grounding affected Southwest's financial performance in the second quarter, and there are concerns about its impact on Southwest for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Unexpected expenses and lower efficiencies were realized during the second quarter as Southwest's fleet was reduced by 34 MAX aircraft, decreasing seat capacity by 5%. Southwest announced an impact of $175 million to operating expenses during the second quarter because of the grounding.   In addition, capital expenditures were affected for fiscal 2019, lowering the spend from $1.9 billion and $2 billion to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Ending the second quarter with 753 aircraft in the total fleet including 34 grounded MAX aircraft, Southwest postponed the scheduled retirement of seven 737-700 aircraft. Keeping the 737-700s in service will allow Southwest to defend seat capacity of 1% into the end of 2019, however, an additional 4 aircraft are scheduled to retire at the end of 2019 -- retiring a total of 11 aircraft or 1.5% of in-service seat capacity.   Southwest announced that the ""MAX-related flight schedule adjustments are now extended through January 5, 2020,"" taking a bite out of the second half of 2019. This delay originally planned to end in November will continue to constrain aircraft capacity. The grounding has removed 200 peak-day flights from the weekly schedule of more than 4,000 flights a day from Southwest's schedule. Southwest had planned to receive 41 more MAX aircraft by the end of 2019, but the airline has said that all scheduled MAX aircraft are postponed until the grounding is rescinded. If the grounding timeline continues beyond expectations, plans will be shifted as Southwest expects to receive another 79 MAX aircraft by the end of 2020 -- adding further delays to expansion and lowering seat capacity. The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association has estimated that the projected relaunch date of January is too conservative, giving an estimate of February or March of 2020 -- at least two to three months longer than the anticipated date stated by Southwest and Boeing. The association also announced a lawsuit against Boeing for $100 million","Oct 22, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/22/is-southwest-airlines-a-buy-before-earnings.aspx

CNBC Newsletters","Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading. Biogen — Shares of Biogen soared 26% after the drug maker said it is seeking regulatory approval for its Alzheimer’s drug, aducanumab, months after stopping trials. Biogen erased its entire 25% year-to-date decline when it said aducanumab “reduced clinical decline in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease.” Travelers — Shares of the insurance giant dropped 8.3% on the back of quarterly earnings results that badly missed analyst expectations. Travelers posted a profit of $1.43 per share while analysts polled by Refinitiv expected $2.35 earnings per share. The miss was driven by a sharp increase in reserves during the quarter. McDonald’s — Shares of fast-food chain McDonald’s fell 5% after its quarterly earnings fell short of Wall Street’s estimates as its promotions failed to gain market share from competitors like Burger King’s parent company Restaurant Brands International, and Wendy’s. McDonald’s reported earnings per share of $2.11 on revenue of $5.4 billion. Analysts forecast earnings of $2.21 per share on revenue of $5.5 billion, according to Refinitiv. Procter & Gamble — Procter & Gamble shares climbed 2.6% after the consumer goods company posted quarterly results that topped analyst expectations. Those results were driven by Procter’s beauty, health care and fabric and home care lines, the company said. JetBlue — The airline’s stock jumped 7.3% on the back of better-than-expected earnings. JetBlue posted adjusted earnings per share of 59 cents. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected a profit of 51 cents a share. “We are just beginning to see the benefits of our revenue, cost, fleet and capital allocation efforts,” CEO Robin Hayes said in a statement. United Parcel Service — Shares of UPS fell 2% after the carrier reported quarterly revenues of $18.32 billion, just missing consensus expectations. The company also announced that Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber, who’s had a hand in much of UPS’s global and freight businesses, will retire at the end of December after 35 years at the company. Harley-Davidson — The Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer rallied 8% after it surprised investors Tuesday with earnings results well ahead of expectations. Harley-Davidson reported earnings per share four cents ahead of forecasts, driven by a smaller-than-expected U.S. sales decline and a 2.7% climb in international revenues.

4,Here's why Apple shares could rally another 25%,Here’s why Apple shares could rally another 25%. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"Apple just smashed through to fresh records. The iPhone maker surged nearly 2% to begin the week after Raymond James analysts upped their price target to $280, the most bullish on the Street. The firm cited stronger estimates for iPhone 11 sales as reason for the increase. Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray, is ready to get even more bullish. “The trend looks great,” Johnson said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Monday. “The stock has just broken out to new all-time highs, and in fact when you look at the size of the consolidation it just broke out of and you do a measurement on it, you can certainly argue for a price objective that, purely based on the charts, [takes you] north of $300 so I’d still be a buyer of Apple in here.”  A move to $300 marks 25% upside from Monday’s close. It would also mark new highs for the stock. Strategic Wealth Partners president Mark Tepper says there’s more to like about Apple than what Raymond James outlined in its bullish case. “What the call doesn’t really mention are some of the things that interest us when it comes to Apple. For the first time in a long time, the iPhone now makes up less than 50% of Apple’s revenues. Why is that important? Because they’re in the process of becoming less reliant on just one product, they’re diversifying their business,” Tepper said during the same segment. Tepper is especially optimistic about growth in Apple’s wearables and services sectors, two areas that focus on recurring revenue. However, while he owns the stock, Tepper has trimmed his position recently to take profits on the back of its major surge higher. Apple is the best Dow performer this year after climbing 52%. “Love the company. We’re going to continue to own the stock, but I do believe most of the easy money has already been made,” said Tepper.

USD/JPY.,"                                                    Monday, October 21, 2019 As of Friday, Wall Street’s top stock market strategists as a consensus expect the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to deliver 10.4% of earnings per share growth in 2020. It’s a number so rosy that many of the strategists themselves expect that number to come down as more information comes in over the next few weeks. While earnings growth forecasts may come down, don’t expect the average to reflect a decline. “Bottom-up earnings expectations (i.e., those derived by aggregating individual company forecasts) have NEVER forecasted a profits recession before one occurred, and current forecasts might be following that historical pattern,” observed Richard Bernstein of Richard Bernstein Advisors. What’s peculiar about the current forecast for the 500 largest companies is that it’s contradicting what the experts are seeing in smaller companies. “Estimates for small and mid- cap stocks have begun to fall, and that makes sense because smaller companies tend to be more sensitive to economic cycles,” Bernstein noted. “However, larger capitalization stocks’ earnings forecasts are still increasing!” This is a bit disappointing because value in the stock market is driven by earnings. And if you can’t get an accurate read on future earnings, then you certainly can’t calculate the fair price of the market with any kind of precision. Bernstein characterizes what would be a gloomier-than-expected outlook for earnings as a “smoke alarm” for investors, who themselves are rarely prepared for bad news. “The fact that bottom-up forecasts have never predicted a profits recession, that small and mid-cap earnings estimates are falling, and that large cap stocks’ estimates are rising seems to suggest more risk than investors are anticipating,” he said. And so, we have a case for some volatility as expectations change and markets adjust. What should you do about this? The late Jack Bogle might say, “Don’t do something. Just stand there!” Bogle might be joking, but what he said is a reminder that investing in stocks is a long-term investors game.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Despite grounding some of their most expensive assets for months, most of the world’s airlines — except for perhaps Ryanair — have been diplomatic in their treatment of Boeing over Max problems. The manufacturer, they say, is a “trusted partner,” and if any disagreements arise, they promise to deal with them privately. Might that soon end? There were many revelations last week in the November 2016 text messages between two top technical pilots for the Boeing 737 Max program, first reported by Reuters. Chief among them are indications Boeing pilots knew how dangerous the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System could be more than two years before two airplanes crashed within five months. “It’s running rampant in the sim on me,” one test pilot said to another, meaning the airplane was behaving erratically in the simulator. That part is getting most press coverage, and rightly so. Boeing screwed up far more than most people realized, even withholding that information from the Federal Aviation Administration. It’s going to get pilloried, and we might see a CEO change or other drastic action. I want to focus on something else. After reading these messages, we have to wonder if airlines knew what they were buying. It’s one thing to not tell pilots about some features — Boeing has said it didn’t want to overwhelm them about a system they might never use — but it’s not clear how much Boeing informed airlines about the Max’s technical features. Would you buy a car if you didn’t know what was in it? The airlines have stayed silent long enough. When will they perk up and start complaining? Usually they whine behind closed doors, negotiating to receive discounts on future orders. But this situation is more complicated than most. It’s time for airlines to complain loudly, so their customers can hear and so the industry will change. Obviously no one was supposed to see these messages. But most revealing was when Chief Technical Pilot Mark Forkner wrote to colleague Patrik Gustavsson to joke about how Boeing markets and sells airplanes.

Can it","MONEY                 Whether you decide to buy GM stock may depend on how confident you are the company is primed for a major comeback.(BILL PUGLIANO/GETTY IMAGES) FOUNDED IN 1908, General Motors Company (ticker: GM) is the epitome of the great American auto manufacturer, producing vehicles in 37 countries across the globe. The auto giant has come a long way in the last 110 years, when William C. Durant founded the company with $2,000 in his pocket. General Motors today has a market capitalization around $52 billion. SEE: With valued auto brands like Buick, Chevrolet, Wuling, GMC and Cadillac, General Motors seems poised to reclaim its mantle of the greatest auto manufacturer on Earth – but to do that, the company is going to have to clear some serious hurdles. GM, currently trading just over $36 per share, has hit some potholes in recent years, even going into bankruptcy in 2009. But the company seems to be on the rebound, offers a strong dividend and has upside room for share price growth as it changes both its corporate culture and business model. Analysts have pegged one-year share growth at $47.42 per share, a welcome sign for shareholders who already enjoy 4.2% dividend payments. GM stock has benefited from taxpayer largesse – the company may not even exist today if it weren’t for an $80 billion bailout from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) at the height of the Great Recession. As Fritz Henderson, GM’s then-president put it at the time – “There is no Plan B.” Doubts over slow-to-move stock prices and completely static revenues both haunt GM right now, with no clear sign when and if the company will emerge from its current state to start posting some positive stock numbers.

Here is the world’s shortest (1.5,"It very well could take you longer to read this story than it would to ride on the world’s shortest scheduled passenger flight. Loganair, a Scottish regional airline, holds that title thanks to its itinerary between Westray and Papa Westray, two of the Orkney Islands located north of Great Britain. The flight, which travels 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers), lasts only 1.5 minutes in the air. The cost of a one-way ticket starts at 17 pounds (roughly $22). That’s a blip compared to the 19.5-hour flight that Australian carrier Qantas QAN, -3.18%   QABSY, -2.43%   is testing this week. The 10,000-mile nonstop voyage on a Boeing BA, -0.67%   787-9 from New York to Sydney will be the world’s longest flight. The title was previously held by the New York-Singapore route flown by Singapore Airlines SINGF, . That trip takes nearly 18 hours — some 1,080 times longer than the Loganair flight, give or take a minute. The Westray-Papa Westray route isn’t the only short flight that Loganair offers. The journey between Eday and Kirkwall, another two of the Orkney Islands, takes a staggering 10 minutes to complete. Looking to take a short trip closer to home? United Airlines UAL, -2.48%  operates the shortest flight in the continental U.S., a 16-minute trip between San Francisco and Santa Rosa, located in the Sonoma County wine region. (Sightseeing flight operator Greater Toronto Airways boasts the shortest flight in North America, a 10-minute route between Toronto and Niagara.) In Hawaii, travelers can take a 15-minute flight between the Kalaupapa and Ho’olehua airports on Moloka’i for as little as $50 on Mokulele Airlines. Of course, flying is particularly bad for the environment — aircraft are responsible for 2.5% of total global carbon dioxide emissions. So travelers concerned about their carbon footprint may want to consider other means of travel — for instance, a 25-minute car ferry also runs between Westray and Papa Westray.

10,An Intrinsic Calculation For Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Suggests It's 46% Undervalued - Simply Wall St News,An Intrinsic Calculation For Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Suggests It's 46% Undervalued. Is Southwest Airlines fairly valued?. 10-year free cash,"Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. I will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: (""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 10-year government bond rate (2.7%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%. Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2019 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.7%) ÷ 8.7%– 2.7%)","Oct 21, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-luv/southwest-airlines/news/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-southwest-airlines-co-nyseluv-suggests-its-46-undervalued
11,Is Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) Overpaying Its CEO? - Simply Wall St News,Is Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) Overpaying Its CEO?. How Does Choon Phong Goh's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?. Is,"Choon Phong Goh has been the CEO of Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) since 2011. This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. And finally - as a second measure of performance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. View our latest analysis for Singapore Airlines At the time of writing, our data says that Singapore Airlines Limited has a market cap of S$11b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of S$5.5m for the year to March 2019. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the salary is lower, valued at S$1.4m. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. When we examined a selection of companies with market caps ranging from S$5.4b to S$16b, we found the median CEO total compensation was S$5.0m. So Choon Phong Goh is paid around the average of the companies we looked at. This doesn't tell us a whole lot on its own, but looking at the performance of the actual business will give us useful context. Shareholders might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts. The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at Singapore Airlines has changed from year to year. On average over the last three years, Singapore Airlines Limited has shrunk earnings per share by 5.9% each year (measured with a line of best fit). Its revenue is up 5.0% over last year. Few shareholders would be pleased to read that earnings per share are lower over three years. And the modest revenue growth over 12 months isn't much comfort against the reduced earnings per share. So given this relatively weak performance, shareholders would probably not want to see high compensation for the CEO. Since shareholders would have lost about 2.8% over three years, some Singapore Airlines Limited shareholders would surely be feeling negative emotions. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously. Remuneration for Choon Phong Goh is close enough to the median pay for a CEO of a similar sized company . Returns have been disappointing and the company is not growing its earnings per share.","Oct 22, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/sg/transportation/sgx-c6l/singapore-airlines-shares/news/is-singapore-airlines-limited-sgxc6l-overpaying-its-ceo-2
12,Will Southwest Airlines Buy JetBlue? - View from the Wing,"Will Southwest Airlines Buy JetBlue?. Next Week’s Debate. But First, Will Southwest Airlines Buy JetBlue?. Southwest Has Taken a Careful","by Gary Leff on October 22, 2019 Next week I’ll debate Stifel analyst Joe DeNardi at the Airline Information 10th Mega Event Worldwide in a main session before the conference breaks into loyalty, ancillary merchandising, and co-brand tracks. We’ll debate whether frequent flyer programs should be spun off into separate businesses.  Joe is the airline analyst most associated with the idea that frequent flyer programs are driving the profitability of airlines and that the market is undervaluing these assets. My position is that frequent flyer programs are good businesses, just not as good as Joe argues, and that the airlines are worse businesses so overall the market values the combined entities fairly. I suggest that frequent flyer programs are most valuable and effective working in concert with their associated airlines (actually, more so even than they do today – I think they need to be factored more into network planning) and that splitting them off will entail real costs and loss in value.  This week, instead of prepping for our debate, Joe is out with a research note arguing that Southwest Airlines should acquire JetBlue to get access to more aircraft, since their own growth is stalled due to the 737 MAX grounding. He appeared on CNBC pitching the likelihood of such a deal:   Historically Southwest has acquired only much smaller carriers. They acquired Muse Air after founding President Lamar Muse and his son founded a competing venture in Southwest’s backyard. The acquisition put a competitor (dubbed “Revenge Air”) out of business. Southwest acquired Morris Air in the 1980s (co-founded by JetBlue founder Dave Neeleman as it happens), certain assets of American Trans Air out of bankruptcy, and then AirTran in 2011 after losing a bid for Frontier.   A JetBlue acquisition would double down on its ‘congested airports in the Northeast and flying to the Caribbean’ strategy from the AirTran deal. Joe’s argument is that they’d acquire planes.  There are cheaper ways to do that. If they want Airbus narrowbodies, American Airlines President Robert Isom reports that used A319s are cheap. They might acquire delivery positions from IndiGo or GoAir out of India. Of course they wouldn’t have already-trained pilots or a maintenance program for those. In April though they kicked the tires on the Airbus A220.

14,Boeing Crisis: The Impact on Southwest’s Q3 Earnings,Boeing Crisis: The Impact on Southwest’s Q3 Earnings. MAX crisis to hurt Southwest Airlines’ capacity. Reduced capacity to hurt profitability.,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO Southwest Airlines (LUV) plans to report its Q3 earnings results on October 24. Wall Street analysts estimate that the airline could report flat year-over-year earnings for the third quarter. They forecast the airline’s Q3 earnings to come in at $1.08 per share, which is in line with Q3 2018. Reduced capacity and increased costs due to the prolonged grounding of the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX aircraft are likely to impact Southwest Airlines’ Q3 earnings negatively. Nonetheless, robust demand and higher passenger yield could offset the negative impact of these factors. Wall Street analysts project Southwest Airlines’ third-quarter revenues to increase 1.1% year-over-year to $5.64 billion. Apart from healthy passenger demand, higher ticket fares are also expected to boost the airline’s top-line results. In its June 13 report, JPMorgan Chase noted that Southwest Airlines had increased its ticket fares twice in the second quarter. The worldwide grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft is causing massive seating capacity and profitability losses for Southwest Airlines. Before the mid-March implementation of its global flying ban, Southwest Airlines had 34 MAX planes. The airline was also scheduled to receive 41 additional MAX planes this year. Due to the grounding of the MAX aircraft, the company is facing approximately 200 daily flight cancellations. According to its September 18 investor update, the company reported nearly 600 flight cancellations in September due to Hurricane Dorian. Southwest Airlines revealed in its investor update that these cancellations negatively impacted its overall seating capacity in the third quarter. As a result, the airline lowered its projection for its third-quarter capacity growth. The company now expects its third-quarter seating capacity to decline 3%, instead of its earlier forecast of a 2%–3% year-over-year decrease. Reduce seating capacity would result in higher unit costs for Southwest Airlines in the third quarter. During its investor update, the company projected its ex-fuel unit cost to increase 8%–10% in the quarter. Furthermore, the company expects the removal of the 737 MAX jets to negatively impact its fuel efficiency. So, Southwest Airlines anticipates its fuel efficiency to fall 1%–2% during the third quarter. In our view, the MAX’s negative impact on Southwest’s Q3 pretax income should be higher than in the second quarter. The company’s second-quarter pretax income took a hit of $175 million due to the MAX grounding. During the second quarter, Southwest Airlines reported over 15,000 flight cancellations.

By: Nicolas Chahine | Email | Leave a comment This week there is an opportunity for the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) to out-perform because of the earnings earnings of lineup of major blue-chips like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The Nasdaq hosts some of the most exciting companies in the world, and this often translates into big gains during bull markets. This year, QQQ out-performing the S&P 500 Index by about 20% so it has momentum on its side. Just because the markets have been in an expansion cycle it doesn’t mean it is ending soon. Yes, there are a few nagging risks like the geopolitical spat between the U.S. and China, not to mention Brexit. But on the other hand we also have the world’s leading companies potentially delivering great results.   Last week Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a less-than-stellar quarter and after a brief celebratory spike, the stock fell apart. This is not necessarily the boiler plate reaction for the next big ones to follow. NFLX had specific issues and they missed on their growth metrics. That is a cardinal sin for a growth stock. Microsoft and Amazon, on the other hand, have much better fundamentals and this is the first reason why the QQQ should out-perform. Most mega-caps that make the QQQ stock have stronger fundamentals so investors will have more conviction in them. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example still sells at a 20 trailing price-t0-earnings ratio and it is at an all time high.

Last Updated at October 22, 2019 02:48 IST STOCK PRICE - CLICK HERE FOR MORE BSE 101.600.05 (0.05%) NSE 101.650.05 (0.05%) As India has emerged as the one of the fastest growing civil aviation markets of the world, it is time that the government take steps to make the aviation sector globally competitive beginning with reduction on its tax structure, the head of a low-cost airline has said. Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet, in an interview to PTI rued that the civil aviation sector in India is highly taxed and identified it as one of the major stumbling blocks in making it globally competitive. ""I think lowering of taxes and looking at aviation in a holistic sense as a job creator, as something that connects India to itself and to the world. It's important that we take a more holistic approach to aviation,"" he said

Singh was in Washington DC last week as part of a business delegation that accompanied Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman who was here to attend the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. ""What we have been asking for a very long time now is that the government should make Indian aviation competitive with its peers around the world. We should make sure that our costs are in line with our peers around the world,"" he said. India, Singh said, is the only country which taxes aviation fuel at an average of about 35 per cent while no other significant aviation country in the world taxes fuel at all. As such Indian carriers are paying a much higher cost of operation and, therefore, they are not competitive with others. That is one big issue, he said. ""The second big issue is on the maintenance and repair operations. In maintenance and repair operations as well, we pay a GST of 18 per cent,"" he added. MROs (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul) is one space where India can be doing exceedingly well, Singh said. ""We can be repairing our own aircraft.","Oct 22, 2019",https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/govt-should-make-indian-aviation-sector-globally-competitive-spicejet-cmd-119102100062_1.html
