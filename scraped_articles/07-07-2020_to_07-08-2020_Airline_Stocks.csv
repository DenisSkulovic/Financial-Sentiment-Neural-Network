Compete Risk Free with,"United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL) just confirmed fears that the surge in COVID-19 cases is undermining hopes for a rapid recovery after the first quarter's massive shutdowns. In a July 6 ""Town Hall"" employee event, the carrier disclosed that July consolidated capacity is likely to contract 75% year over year, following an 88% drop in June. In addition, United warned that August guidance for 65% is likely to mark peak performance for 2020 passenger volume, with little or no improvement through year end. United stock fell after the news, selling off into five-week support near $31.00. More importantly, accumulation-distribution readings have crashed in the past month, dropping within striking distance of the May low, which found support less than 30 cents above March's eight-year low. Support tends to weaken each time it gets tested, raising the threat of an eventual breakdown that drops United shares to levels not seen since 2009. It took nearly eight years for United stock to complete a round trip into the 2007 high above $50, yielding a modest 2015 breakout that topped out in the mid-$70s a few months later. A higher low in the $30s in 2016 stoked buying interest, ahead of a 2017 uptick that limped into December 2018's all-time high at $97.85. Price action held within a narrow trading range in 2019, finally giving way to a February 2020 breakdown that ended within three points of the 2011 low in March. The downtick reversed at the .786 Fibonacci retracement of the nine-year uptrend, a common turning point, but the second quarter bounce failed to pierce the .382 selloff retracement level. It is now trading about half the distance between the March low and the June high, with price action growing heavier by the day. The monthly stochastic oscillator has failed to enter a buy cycle during this period despite a rally of 30-plus points, highlighting strongly bearish technicals that favor even lower prices. The announcement from United raises doubts about plans by rival American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) to increase summer capacity after upbeat remarks about May and June traffic. The recent willingness of these corporations to strike deals with the government for federal loans also suggests a dimmer view of future prospects because the bailouts will generate additional dilution through warrants issued to the U.S Treasury. American Airlines shareholders have walked away since the July 1 announcement about increased capacity, dumping","Jul 8, 2020",https://www.investopedia.com/investors-dumping-airline-stocks-like-hot-potatoes-5070683

3,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today. A big uptick in new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is putting pressure on,"   United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) is seeing new bookings decline as COVID-19 cases spike, and that's putting pressure on airline stocks on Tuesday. Shares of United and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) each traded down 5% as of noon EDT, while shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) are down 4%. A number of other airline stocks, including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), were all down more than 2%. Airline stocks were hit hard by the initial wave of the coronavirus pandemic, with travel demand seemingly bottoming out in late March/early April. We've seen a resurgence in demand in the months since, which has caused United and other airlines to add flights heading into late summer. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. But COVID-19 cases are also on the rise in many areas of the country, and that is beginning to eat into demand. United told employees Monday the booking momentum has faded. The airline's Newark, New Jersey, hub has been hit particularly hard after New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut imposed a 14-day quarantine on visitors from parts of the country where the pandemic is growing worse. The airlines were prohibited from laying off staff before Sept. 30 as a condition of receiving relief funds through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act stimulus package, but United has warned employees it is likely to shrink significantly this fall. Other airlines, including Delta and Southwest, have also said that, absent a substantial uptick in demand, they are going to have to reduce the size of their operations. The airlines are getting added help from the government to weather an extended downturn. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that Delta, United, Southwest, JetBlue, and Alaska have all signed letters of intent to receive loans as part of the CARES Act. Last week several airlines, including American and Spirit, were the first to finalize deals to receive additional government funding. The assumption for some time now has been that the airlines will be facing a slow, multiyear recovery. A bout of optimism in May and early June as airlines made plans to resume some service seemingly caused some investors to believe the timetable might be moving up, but these latest moves indicate the airlines still see a long, tough climb ahead.

9,United Airlines Stock Could Go to $30 Before $40 | InvestorPlace,"United Airlines Stock Could Go to $30 Before $40. As the airline gets ready to report Q2 earnings, UAL stock"," As the new earnings season gets under way, investors in United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock are wondering whether the stock will continue to recover some of its 2020 losses. So far in the year, UAL stock is down over 63%, currently hovering at $34.  If you are not yet a shareholder, you might want to first analyze the group’s Q2 results that are due in a few weeks. Although the company has not yet announced the date, the results are expected on July 21. UAL stock is likely to be volatile at the time, possibly with a downward bias. I expect the shares to move toward $30. Therefore if you are not yet a shareholder, you may want to wait for a pullback to commit new capital to the stock. The past several months must have been among the most challenging in most airlines’ recent history, as the COVID-19 pandemic has meant a scary fallout for travel stocks. United Airlines announced Q1 earnings on April 30. The Chicago-based carrier reported net loss of $1.7 billion, diluted loss per share of $6.86, and pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion. Management also announced that the daily cash burn would be between $40 million and $45 million during the second quarter of 2020. Airlines are highly capital-intensive businesses and it costs dearly to maintain planes and pay for other fixed assets. Since late April, our economy has started opening up. Yet air travel has not yet increased much. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) releases regular updates on TSA checkpoint travel numbers. According to the most recent data, on Wednesday, July 1, total traveler throughput was 626,516. Last year, on the same weekday, it was 2,547,889. That is a decline of over 75%. However, the current numbers are an improvement from where the level was earlier in the year. For example, the numbers were:  Put another way, airlines are seeing improved passenger numbers at this point. However, as you would have noticed, the metrics for Q2, i.e., the months of April, May, and June, were rather dismal. It would not be wrong to say that they would have represented new record lows for traffic in over a decade. It is highly likely that losses for most airlines including United will be quite high when the next quarterly numbers come out. And if a second wave of the pandemic takes over our daily lives again,","Jul 8, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/07/united-airlines-stock-could-go-to-30-before-40/
10,"Stay Bullish on United Airlines Stock, Even as Covid Cases Spike | InvestorPlace","Stay Bullish on United Airlines Stock, Even as Covid Cases Spike. United Airlines stock is set to weather the storm"," Airlines stocks are under the hammer as the U.S. grapples with a possible second wave of the novel coronavirus. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is a casualty of this bearish outlook. After falling to historic losses in mid-March, United Airlines stock erased its losses over the last three months until reports emerged of a spike in cases once reopenings went into effect.  That’s a shame since I believe UAL still offers a lot of upside under $40 a pop. The legacy carrier continues to boost liquidity as passenger numbers rise with every passing week. Daily cash burn will fall to approximately $10 million in the third quarter, leaving it with plenty of capital in case of a prolonged slowdown. That’s not to say I am not aware of the acute problems the airline finds itself in. Debt is increasing at a rapid rate, and the company is expected to scale down operations, inhibiting future growth. And while air travel demand is rising, it will take time for it to get to pre-pandemic levels. However, there are still enough reasons for me to back UAL stock at this time. Liquidity is a burning issue for every airline at the moment. Experts agree that it will take a long time before we see airline travel return to its levels before the crisis. That’s why it’s a no brainer that operational cash flow will be stressed during this time. As I wrote in my previous article, UAL has done well to shore up its balance sheet to make sure it survives the crisis. Since that time, the company got another $5 billion secured by the airline’s loyalty program, bringing total liquidity to approximately $20 billion. Considering cash burn will drop to $30 million in Q3, UAL already has enough capital to ride out the year. The only catch here is the increased interest expenses that will weigh down the bottom line for years to come. That’s why I think it’s in the company’s best interest to not take out any further loans.

BTC-USD.,"                                                   Investors in Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Aug 21, 2020 $17.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Spirit Airlines shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Spirit Airlines is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Transportation - Airline industry that ranks in the Bottom 14% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has widened our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of $2.82 per share to a loss of $2.88 in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about Spirit Airlines right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

As travel resumes, I’d","      Click here for The Motley Fool UK’s resources on Coronavirus and the market. Charles Heighton | Wednesday, 8th July, 2020 | More on: IAG The airline industry worldwide has had a disastrous year. For obvious reasons, flights have been grounded and travel virtually ceased for months. There has been a lot of talk about Covid-19 changing the airline industry forever. It has been suggested that significantly fewer people will travel even after we return to some form of normality. While this may be true for a few years, the industry will recover. Consumers love to travel and memories of traumatic events are short. For instance, despite predictions that the tragic events of 9/11 would significantly reduce air traffic in the US, it had little to no effect in the long run. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential... While businesses have continued to meet from a distance, this is not viable in the long run. If professionals like consultants do not want to travel any more, they will have to lower their prices to reflect their lower costs. It is unlikely that this will occur.  While it is impossible, as other authors have noted, to predict when the industry will rebound, it is almost a certainty that flight volumes will increase from their current levels. As revenues increase, airline stocks will increase too, leaving an opportunity for bold investors to profit. Even if flights do not reach 2019 volumes for several years as analysts are suggesting, stocks will still recover from current lows. I believe that International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE: IAG) is a bargain stock right now, and is the right choice to outperform the FTSE and its competitors.  Unlike US airline stocks like American Airlines Group and Southwest Airlines, which have experienced high volatility, European airline stocks have remained very low.

16,Is Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock a Buy Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Is Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock a Buy Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic?. Air,"      Joey Frenette | July 7, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) is an intriguing high-upside bet for those looking to ride on the tails of a rebound in the air travel industry. But you’ve got to know what you’re signing up for with a bet on the name amid the coronavirus crisis, so you can minimize the chances that you’ll lose your shirt in your pursuit of outsized gains. The coronavirus pandemic has decimated travel and leisure stocks. To this day, a majority of commercial airline stocks have yet to participate in the big relief rally the broader markets have been enjoying. Like it or not, the commercial airlines will probably never reach pre-pandemic levels of normalcy until the advent of an effective coronavirus vaccine or until the virus works its course. The former scenario could lead to very sharp, sudden gains in a potential V-shaped rebound, while the latter is likely to lead to a slow and steady U-shaped recovery that could span many years. The keyword here is effective, as several pundits have noted the possibility that a vaccine may not be as effective at eliminating the coronavirus as most think. A complete eradication of the virus is unlikely to happen in a timely manner, but an elimination (where the virus is mostly wiped out in various geographies) is possible if a vaccine that lands is effective. Given the possibility that a less-than-effective vaccine may not be suitable for certain populations based on factors such as age, herd immunity (the ultimate goal for airline stock investors) across various geographies is no guarantee with the first vaccine that lands. With limited visibility into when this horrific COVID-19 pandemic will conclude and what the endgame will entail, there’s no telling when it’ll be safe to hit the skies once again with Air Canada stock. A bull-case scenario could result in a multitude of upside, but if we’re without an effective vaccine for years and the virus can’t be contained via other means, few things, I believe, will stop Air Canada stock from facing excessive turbulence en route to the single digits.

Features. Elsewhere on the,"The future of Asia's biggest budget airline, AirAsia, is in “significant doubt”, auditor Ernst & Young has said. Shares in the Malaysian-based airline fell by more than 17% on Wednesday after being halted earlier in the day. The airline’s founder and chief executive is tycoon Tony Fernandes, who also co-owns Queens Park Rangers (QPR) football club in the UK. The world's airlines have been hit hard by the sharp fall in passengers due to strict coronavirus travel restrictions. Ernst & Young highlighted the airline’s huge debts in a statement to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange late on Tuesday. It said AirAsia’s current liabilities already exceeded its current assets by 1.84bn ringgit ($430m; £340m) at the end of 2019, before the start of the pandemic. The Asian carrier’s financial performance and cash flow have been further hit by the grounding of its planes amid tight travel curbs and lockdowns. This slump and AirAsia's financial performance ""indicate existence of material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern,"" Ernst & Young said in its unqualified audit opinion statement. On Monday, AirAsia reported a record quarterly loss of 803.8m ringgit. The budget airline started suspending flights in late March. ""This is by far the biggest challenge we have faced since we began in 2001,” Mr Fernandes said in a statement. “Every crisis is an obstacle to overcome, and we have restructured the group into a leaner and tighter ship."" ""We are positive in the strides we have made in bringing cash expenses down by at least 50% this year, and this will make us even stronger as the leading low-cost carrier in the region,” he added. AirAsia said it was in talks over joint ventures and collaborations that may result in additional investment. It has also applied for bank loans and is weighing proposals to raise additional capital.
