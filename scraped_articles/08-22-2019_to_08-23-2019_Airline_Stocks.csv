1,Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Care About Airline Stock Turbulence – 24/7 Wall St.,. . . . . Why Warren Buffett Doesn't Care About Airline Stock Turbulence. EDITORS' PICKS. Will Shipping Problems Ruin,"Warren Buffett has been considered one of the greatest investors of the modern era. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) is one of the greatest growth stories of the 20th and 21st centuries combined, and Buffett and his team have been aggressive investors in many companies and sectors over the years. After his portfolio managers made a big airline sector bet in 2016, the stakes saw some changes from 2017 through 2018. Team Buffett has accumulated a substantial weight in the airline industry, and his rationale for owning airline shares was that the industry finally had gotten an entire century of poor performance out of the way. There also might have been some valuation metrics and future earnings power that were just too good to pass up. While the airlines have seen some pullbacks in the wake of trade war uncertainty and amid the grounding of the entire Boeing 737 Max fleet, Buffett and portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs are currently in a race with Primecap Management to be the largest owner of airline stocks in the world. After last week’s holdings release for the second quarter of 2019, Berkshire Hathaway’s $10 billion work of airline stocks was almost 5% of its $208 billion in total equity holdings. It turns out that the airlines have seen their share of ups and downs over the past three years since Buffett, Combs and Weschler decided to get involved. Airlines have dirt-cheap price-to-earnings ratios, they have pricing power and they now pay dividends and are buyers of their own shares. Back in early 2017, 24/7 Wall St. showed how Buffett was making a dandy profit off the industry. That has seen some turbulence since, but all in it seems that Weschler, Combs and even Buffett himself are sitting on a pretty firm cushion, compared to when they bought their airline stocks. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) was kept unchanged at a stake of 43.7 million shares, and while this was the same as the prior two filings, it was a tad lower than the 44.7 million share stake that had been counted last in September. The end of June value was $1.425 billion in American Air, but the $32.50 share price at that time (adjusted for dividend) is well above the $26.50 level seen on August 22. Adjusted for dividends, American’s closing price at the end of 2016 was $45.43.

2,Is Copa Holdings Overvalued? | The Motley Fool,Is Copa Holdings Overvalued?. Let's look at whether the Latin American carrier's shares deserve the premium they're currently enjoying in,"   Maybe it seems disingenuous to ask if Copa Holdings (NYSE:CPA), which has a market capitalization of $4.4 billion and trades at just 13 times forward earnings, is overvalued, given that the S&P MidCap 400 Index currently sits at a forward PE ratio of 15.3. But if we place Copa's current market pricing in the context of the larger airline industry, the question gains some relevance:  CPA PE RATIO (FORWARD) DATA BY YCHARTS. In a cross-section of legacy airlines, low-cost carriers, and ultra-low-cost carriers, Copa stands out for market pricing that is substantially higher than the forward PE ratio of 8.1 averaged by the rest of the group in the chart above. Copa's shares have appreciated by 21% over the last 12 months, despite a plethora of industry headwinds. Most visible of these issues is the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX airplane, which continues to disrupt airlines' profits and capacity planning. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) reported in July that MAX groundings cost it $175 million in profits in the second quarter, effectively reducing its operating income by 17%. Southwest (NYSE:LUV), another carrier with significant investments in the MAX, relayed in its own second-quarter report that it's revamped its estimated year-over-year capacity outlook in 2019 in terms of available seat miles (ASMs), from 5% growth to a contraction of 1% to 2%. Copa's exposure to the MAX grounding isn't insignificant, but it's manageable. The organization currently holds 6 MAX aircraft in its fleet of 104 planes and is awaiting delivery on 7 additional aircraft. Taking the MAX out of service reduced Copa's capacity in ASMs by 4.3% in the second quarter, yet revenue passenger miles (RPMs) only slipped by 2.5%. Copa's load factor (a measure of how fully flights are loaded) actually increased 160 basis points year over year to 85.1%, a sign of demand across its broader fleet and flight routes in general. Investor angst over near-term economic growth is also compressing the stock charts of U.S. and global carriers. The World Bank forecasts that global gross domestic product (GDP) will decline from 3% in 2018 to 2.6% this year. Fears of a potential U.S. recession are also diminishing the outlook for the airline industry. Yet Copa's geographical base of Latin America is benefiting from airline passenger traffic growth in both commercial and leisure segments, despite economic volatility in the region. Indeed, in the second quarter, Copa saw","Aug 22, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/22/is-copa-holdings-overvalued.aspx

John Collison:","  US stock markets will remain idle today, leaving the world's largest equity exchanges paralysed for a third straight day after unprecedented air attacks toppled the World Trade Centre in the heart of New York City's financial district. Many financial professionals took the day off and may take another, after New York Stock Exchange chairman, Mr Richard Grasso, said equity markets will begin trading as early as tomorrow, but no later than Monday. ""It is clearly the goal to bring this market up as quickly as humanly possible,"" Mr Grasso said at a New York press briefing. Trading in US government debt, by contrast, will resume today at noon, Irish time. On resumption of trading, share prices are expected to fall sharply as investors respond to the potential effects of the atrocity on the American economy. European financial markets were in virtual paralysis yesterday after the terrorist attacks which closed Wall Street for a second day. Activity slowed to a trickle as investors began the daunting task of assessing the implications of the attacks on the World Trade Centre that left thousands dead and destroyed both landmark towers which housed offices of many banks and financial institutions. ""The market's gone completely passive,"" said one senior equity broker at the London headquarters of a leading US investment bank. ""Much of what's being done is people closing down positions if they can do it with the original person it was set up with, so as not to multiply counterparty risk. Otherwise there's very little business going on,"" he said. There was no dealing in US shares on Europe's stock markets. Abnormally high activity in insurance and airline stocks - the sectors most affected by the terrorist attacks, offset by unusually low trade in all other sectors, meant overall volumes in equity markets looked to be holding up relatively well. However, as benchmark equity indices moved erratically, investors and brokers limited their trades to bare essentials. The Eurotop Index of 300 leading shares added 0.8 percent after a see-saw morning session, and following a fall of more than six percent on Tuesday. Britain's FTSE 100, which fell 5.7 per cent in its worst slide since the 1987 crash, regained about half of Tuesday's losses.

4,American Airlines Near Its Five-Year Low: Why the Drag?,American Airlines Near Its Five-Year Low: Why the Drag?. Comparing American Airlines stock with its peers and the industry. Macro,"UPDATED 1 YEAR AGO American Airlines (AAL) stock is going through turbulent times. The stock has lost nearly 17.4% of its market value year-to-date and has underperformed the broader market. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq indexes are up 12.5%, 16.6%, and 20.4%, respectively, year-to-date. At yesterday’s closing price of $26.53, American Airlines stock is currently trading near its five-year low of $24.85 reached on June 27, 2016. The stock is down 55% from its five-year high of $59.08 attained on January 16, 2018. AAL is down nearly 40% from its 52-week high of $43.89 reached on September 21, 2018. In this article, we’ll look at the factors responsible for the underperformance of American Airlines stock. In comparison with the industry, American Airlines stock has underperformed the iShares Transportation Average ETF (IYT), which invests in Dow Jones US transportation stocks. IYT allocates approximately 18.2% of its fund in the passenger airline industry, and the ETF is up 10% YTD. AAL stock’s performance lags its major peers. Year-to-date, shares of Southwest Airlines (LUV) and United Airlines (UAL) have gained 10.1% and 2.2%, respectively. Delta Air Lines (DAL) stock has emerged as the top performer among major US air carriers, returning 16.2% this year so far. Delta Air Lines does not have any 737 MAX aircraft in its fleet. Global slowdown concerns and uncertainty over the US-China trade negotiations kept investors cautious about the airline industry’s near-term growth prospects. Although these macroeconomic factors don’t have a direct impact on the industry, the industry reflects these factors’ effects in the long run. Increasingly tense trade relations could negatively impact airlines’ business traveler traffic in the long run. Sluggish economic growth generally affects the job market adversely, leading people to postpone or cancel their vacation plans. Further, business disruptions at the start of the year also compelled investors to remain cautious about the airline industry. Notably, the partial government shutdown and severe winter weather at the start of 2019 hampered the operations of several airlines. In an April 9 SEC filing, American Airlines revealed that it canceled more than 1,000 flights in the first quarter due to the partial government shutdown. One of AAL’s major competitors, Southwest Airlines, also faced massive business disruptions in early 2019. The company canceled 3,800 flights in the first quarter due to unfavorable weather conditions. Additionally, Southwest delayed its Hawaiian Islands expansion plan due to the","Aug 23, 2019",https://marketrealist.com/2019/08/american-airlines-stock-near-five-year-low/

CNBC Newsletters","Home construction stocks have been hitting the nail on the head over the past month. The ITB Home Construction ETF is up 7% in the last month, its highest level since April 2018. The group of stocks has rallied as the S&P 500 has fallen nearly 2%. Tradinganalysis.com founder Todd Gordon is eyeing the largest of the homebuilders — D.R. Horton. There is “a really nice technical pattern here, sort of an inverse head and shoulders. … We’re through just at about $48. It’s a pretty good jumping off point to see if we can get those highs,” Gordon said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” D.R. Horton has climbed over 45% this year, a rally Gordon says has largely been driven by lower bond yields and interest rates.  “Let’s look at the 10-year yield. … We’ve broken below the 2% level, making new lows there, which is driving housing. The one thing I would say is [there is] a little bit of divergence. You have the ITB not yet at those old highs, so we are playing a little bit of a catch-up here. I think yields need to continue to drop to see buying in housing,” Gordon said. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly inverted below the 2-year yield on Thursday. It did so last week for the first time since 2007, preceding the financial crisis. A yield curve inversion is seen as a historical indicator of a coming recession.  Quint Tatro, founder and president of Joule Financial, agrees it’s a good time to break ground on homebuilders. “We still like housing. Interest rates are going lower, the consumer is still strong, and again, we’re not in this recession camp,” Tatro said. Home construction activity is often dependent of strength in the broader economy. Tatro says a smaller stock within the ITB has been on his radar. “We like to pinpoint valuation, so look at MDC Holdings. The company has a 3% dividend, $7 per share in cash, very attractive balance sheet, but its selling 10x forward earnings and growing next year’s earnings at 20%, so again, I think we steer away from some of the bigger names, look regionally, and we like MDC Holdings here.” Tatro said.

8,"Despite Its High P/E Ratio, Is Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Still Undervalued? - Simply Wall St News","Despite Its High P/E Ratio, Is Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Still Undervalued?. How Do I Calculate Southwest Airlines's Price To","Today, we'll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We'll show how you can use Southwest Airlines Co.'s (NYSE:LUV) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Southwest Airlines has a price to earnings ratio of 11.72, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 8.5%. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines The formula for P/E is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for Southwest Airlines: P/E of 11.72 = $50.59 ÷ $4.32 (Based on the year to June 2019.) A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E. One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. The image below shows that Southwest Airlines has a higher P/E than the average (8.8) P/E for companies in the airlines industry. Its relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Southwest Airlines shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. P/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers. Southwest Airlines saw earnings per share decrease by 27% last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 23%. The 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth. Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof). Since Southwest Airlines holds net cash of","Aug 22, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-luv/southwest-airlines/news/despite-its-high-p-e-ratio-is-southwest-airlines-co-nyseluv-still-undervalued

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian likes to say his company’s competitive advantage is its people, but at least one employee group at America’s most profitable airline is unhappy. It’s the pilots, the only major workgroup represented by a labor union. Last week, Delta’s Master Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association wrote to federal regulators to ask them to take a special look at Delta’s joint venture agreements with Air France-KLM, Virgin Atlantic, and Alitalia to ensure they’re fair to labor. Delta has antitrust immunity with the three European airline companies, and Delta shares costs and revenue with them on transatlantic flights. While the union has supported this arrangement in the past, pilots used the new filing to ask whether Delta wants to leverage the joint ventures so it can fly fewer transatlantic flights and save on labor costs. By turning over more flying to European airlines, Delta has been engaging in “labor arbitrage,” the union claims. The union said it has “serious concerns ” about what it called “the inequitable allocation of service growth.” The filing comes as the U.S. Department of Transportation prepares to authorize a new, more cohesive joint venture among the airlines that will replace two older ones. The government has already tentatively approved it, and it is highly unlikely it would reverse its decision because of pilot concerns. Delta’s pilots doesn’t want it turned down, either. Instead, the union seeks another remedy. Under the current plan, the government plans to review its anti-trust immunity decision in five years to ensure the airlines provide the benefits for consumers they promised. During that review, the pilots have asked the department “to assess its impact on U.S. aviation jobs and the balance of flying and growth opportunities generated in joint venture markets.” Here are some of the key issues at stake.

GoAir and Vistara managed to increase or hold on","                                           Smaller airlines GoAir and Vistara have managed to either hold on or increase their market share in the domestic market this year. On the other hand, larger carriers, including IndiGo, Air India and SpiceJet, struggled as their share fluctuated. In the case of the national carrier, the decline has been the sharpest, since April this year. Earlier this week, industry regulator DGCA released the industry numbers for July. GoAir, the carrier owned by the Wadia family, has seen its share increasing from 8.7 percent in January to 11.1 percent in July. Interestingly, the airline has managed to hold on to its market share - at 11.1 percent - for three consecutive months since May. It now gives Air India competition for the third spot in the domestic market. Similarly, Vistara has seen a sharp increase in its share this year. From 3.8 percent in January, the JV between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines saw its share increasing to 6 percent in July. Air Asia, Tata Sons' other JV airline - this time with Malaysia's Air Asia Berhad - saw its share going up to 6.5 percent in July, from 5.3 percent in January. All these airlines have made the most of the space created by Jet Airways, which suspended its operations in April. Going by the response to its insolvency process, reviving the airline now looks like a tough task. The competition has in the meantime aggressively expanded its services. GoAir launched new eight flights in July. In the same month, AirAsia India announced new flights from Delhi, to Chennai and Kolkata. A month earlier, Vistara added 62 new flights to its network. The airline now connects Mumbai with 10 cities. The bigger peers The bigger airlines too have improved upon their presence in the domestic aviation industry, among the fastest in the world. But the increase in their market share may not be as sharp as in the case of their smaller peers.

GoAir | IPOs | civil aviation sector Nikita Vashisht  |  New Delhi 
Last Updated at August 23, 2019 08:02 IST The management of Wadia-group controlled GoAir is in a huddle these days, finalising its plan to raise about Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 crore through an initial public offer (IPO). While the idea may not be new, for the airline has been toying with it at least since 2015, it has gathered momentum at a time when the Indian aviation sector is dealing with tepid growth in air travel and volatile crude oil prices. Further, investors’ sentiment has also taken a hit in the past two months. Consider this: the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex had gained around 10 per cent between January and June 2019. The gains, however, are down to just over 3 per cent year-to-date (YTD). That apart, volatility in the equity market saw the fund mobilisation, during the first half of the calendar year 2019 (H1CY19) via IPO route, hit a four-year low. Analysts have attributed the tepid H1CY19 to the overall market sentiment. Besides, the overall economic scenario has kept companies at bay from raising fresh capital, they say. Given this backdrop, budget carrier GoAir’s plan to raise funds via IPO does raise concerns over its timing, route, and success. That said, even though the public listing has been tepid in 2019, it maybe the best for the aviation sector, experts say. “While the Qualified Institutional Investors (QIP) route is available only to already-listed companies, Private Equity (PE) investors target returns over a specific period of time, which is not possible in the aviation sector,” says Mark Martin, founder and CEO of Martin Consulting LLC. Typically, PE investors eye an investment return of 25 per cent over three-five years, which is not possible in the aviation sector given the uncertainties. Airlines need a gestation period of at least 10-15 years, experts say. IS IPO THE RIGHT STRATEGY? An IPO at this juncture, analysts feel, may open expansion routes for GoAir, which hasn’t truly reaped benefits of the vacuum created by Jet Airways. “It hardly took nine-10 slots of Jet,","Aug 23, 2019",https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/waiting-in-the-wings-is-the-time-and-ipo-strategy-right-for-goair-119082300133_1.html

What," QAN Jordan Baird is the head ASR Wealth Advisers client services desk and has been with the organisation since 2017. He first started investing in his early years. While he believes that investors should leave no stone unturned he has a particular interest in trading based on broad macroeconomic trends along with specific analysis of innovative up-and-coming companies. Qantas Airways Limited (ASX: QAN) operates passenger transportation airlines with Jetstar and Qantas being its two key brands.  This morning (22nd August 2019) Qantas Airways Limited reported its FY19 results that are highlighted below:   The 17% decline in profits Qantas has reported has been attributed to a $614m increase in fuel costs and $154m foreign exchange costs, the Company also reported a $92m accounting cost related to employee leave. Qantas has highlighted that its key business operations remain profitable as Qantas achieved 4%-unit revenue growth in its domestic operations despite flat volume growth, as a result of new baggage options and an uptake in mining operations. QAN’s international operations experienced a 28% decline in  EBIT as fuel prices raised fares and lowered sales volumes, however Qantas believes its new fleet and network will contribute to future revenue growth with its Perth-London route attracting popularity. Qantas loyalty reported an 8% growth in EBIT as membership reaches 250,000 customers and insurance and financial products continue to generate increased earnings.   Qantas has predicted growth in fuel costs in 2020 at a value of $100m however QAN is expecting increased capacity to offset these costs. The Company is also offering guidance that capacity will grow by 1% across the group in FY 2020, whilst net depreciation and amortisation is expected to rise to $130m in 2020 worsening the possibility of QAN producing a strong balance sheet.   The market has responded positively with the share price rising 3.2% to $5.96 as investors are encouraged by QAN record revenue result and the 79.7m share buy back.

Our mission is to help as many people as possible to leverage the stock market in order to become financially free. Hey! My name is Mike D'Antonio. I am the Founder/CEO of StockedUp. I've been trading the stock market since I was 15 years old. I've taught over 4,000 people how to trade the stock and options market and have programmed numerous trading algorithms. Check out my story below!  I can give you a list of the 10 stocks that have a 90% chance of going up next month and most new traders would still lose money. This is because the stocks can go down before they go up. Most new traders would sell their positions when they are down because they are scared they are going to lose more money. So, they panic, sell, and walk away with a loss. In reality, they should have held and let their investments develop. Sometimes you have to have the guts to hold a position even if it's down. No matter how good of a trader you become, you will never win every single trade. Some of the best traders in history only won 75% of the time. Keep it simple. If the stock market was for geniuses, you'd see a lot more smart people trading stocks actively. Trading stocks is a unique skill that is developed with experience. Yes, I know, it sounds like a cliché. However, if you never quit, you will eventually find something that works. It took me hundreds of strategies/algorithms to find five that work. Looking back on my process, I am glad I never quit.  ","Aug 22, 2019",https://stockedup.university/about
