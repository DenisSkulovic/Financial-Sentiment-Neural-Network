USD/JPY.,"                                                   This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll look at Southwest Airlines Co.'s (NYSE:LUV) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Southwest Airlines has a P/E ratio of 12.28, based on the last twelve months. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying $12.28 for every $1 in prior year profit. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines The formula for price to earnings is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for Southwest Airlines: P/E of 12.28 = $54.91 ÷ $4.47 (Based on the year to September 2019.) A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future. One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (8.8) for companies in the airlines industry is lower than Southwest Airlines's P/E. That means that the market expects Southwest Airlines will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling. Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.

9,Biotech doubles health care gains in 2019. How to play it,Biotech is beating health care by double this year—here’s how one investor would play it. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News,"Biotech is breaking out. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) climbed to a new 52-week high following a wave of deals in the group. Among them were Merck’s $2.7 billion purchase of cancer drugmaker ArQule, Sanofi’s $2.5 billion buyout of Synthorx, a company specializing in cancer and autoimmune disorder therapies, and Roche’s freshly extended $4.3 billion takeover offer for gene therapy developer Spark Therapeutics. Monday’s slight gains brought the XBI’s year-to-date gains to 32%, more than double the roughly 15% move for the broader Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) and exceeding the 25% rise in the S&P 500.  These deals tell Strategic Wealth Partners chief Mark Tepper that biotech’s bigger players are in need of growth, but they also help build the bull case for some of the group’s smaller names. “People are living longer, so there’s definitely a need for new, innovative drugs, especially [related to] cancer,” Tepper said Monday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “We prefer biotech companies where there’s already a product in the market right now because it gives you better revenue visibility.” While “small-cap biotech companies can ... be hit-or-miss” investments, he added, those that have already gone through the complex approval processes required to bring their products to market are largely a better bet. “Exact Sciences is one of the top names on our watch list right now,” he said. “They specialize in colorectal cancer. So, traditional testing methods cause a lot of patients to either put off or avoid getting tested, and what they’ve done is they’ve developed a less invasive, more patient-friendly way to test, and now the FDA’s actually approved it for younger people as well, so their market’s grown.” Better yet for buyers, shares of Exact Sciences have lost serious steam since midsummer, falling over 28% from their July 30 peak of $123.99, as of Monday’s close. The stock ended Monday’s trading session down more than 2% at $84.19. “They’re making some acquisitions, they’re working to diversify their revenue stream, and the stock’s been beaten up,” he said. “Valuation’s looking much better now at the current price levels. I mean, the stock had a great run, they had a tremendous quarter, but expectations were just super high [and] the thing pulled back. However, the growth story’s still intact and I think right now is a good entry point.” Craig Johnson, senior technical research analyst at Piper Jaffray, also","Dec 10, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/10/biotech-doubles-health-care-gains-in-2019-how-to-play-it.html

Richard Branson | Virgin Atlantic Aneesh Phadnis  |  Mumbai 
Last Updated at December 11, 2019 23:42 IST Virgin Atlantic founder Richard Branson is a man who loves to take up challenges. At the age of 69, he has launched a cruise line, is preparing for a test flight in a spacecraft and taking on established airlines on the India-UK market. Virgin Atlantic failed on the London-Mumbai route twice before but Branson hopes the airline will be third time lucky. It is capitalising on the growth in traffic, decline in capacity following closure of Jet Airways and its partnership with “big brother” Delta Airlines of the US.   Branson, who was in Mumbai to promote the new flights, has ruled out investing in Air India. Branson, however, plans to invest in a hyperloop to connect Mumbai-Pune in 15 minutes. He will meet Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday to clear misunderstanding around the project. “There is no money expected from government. It will all be private investment and the public will benefit immensely because of the hyperloop,” he asserted. While air traffic between India and the UK has grown, closure of Jet Airways reduced capacity in the market, opening up opportunity for Virgin Atlantic. Currently, Air India, British Airways and Emirates dominate the traffic on routes between the two countries. “Our flights are going almost full and we are seeing healthy returns,” said the airline’s (Virgin’s) executive vice-president Juha Jarvinen. “We are here to stay. Adding a second Delhi flight is our commitment to the Indian market,” he added. The airline is also exploring the option to connect Manchester with India. Virgin Atlantic had a strong commercial partnership with Jet Airways which shut operations in April. Virgin is looking for other Indian partners which will feed its services from Mumbai and Delhi. “There aren’t many brides with a name like Virgin. We are quite unique and we should be able to find a partner,” Branson quipped. Branson, who founded Virgin Atlantic 35 years ago and saw many rivals go bust, recently retained control over his airline.

LinkedIn. . Twitter. . Email.,"WestJet Airlines Ltd. shareholders won't be receiving a quarterly dividend this month after Onex Corp. announced the completion of its acquisition of the Calgary-based airline. WestJet and Onex say the payment won't be made because the deal has closed before Dec. 18. The airline's board of directors had declared a 14 cents per share dividend on Oct. 28 to be paid on Dec. 31 to shareholders next week. The Toronto-based private equity firm and its affiliated funds say the deal closed following a final regulatory approval Tuesday by the Canadian Transportation Agency that found WestJet continued to meet Canadian ownership and control requirements following its purchase by Onex. Onex says its portion of the total equity investment is about $345 million as a limited partner and largest investor in Onex Partners V. It declined to disclose further terms of the transaction. WestJet shareholders will receive $31 in cash for each share and the shares will be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange within a few trading days. The Canadian Transportation Agency required Onex to amend its bylaws to ensure that matters related to WestJet be voted by the board of directors where a majority of Canadian directors are present. Analyst Chris Murray of AltaCorp Capital says the transportation regulator's conditions were ""not unexpected but should be manageable."" ""While the review by the CTA has taken longer than our initial expectations, the determination that Onex needs to operate as Canadian as the parent company of Kestrel Bidco, the vehicle created to facilitate the takeover transaction, does not appear onerous,"" he wrote in a report.

Boeing stock (NYSE:BA) declined sharply on Wednesday amid chilling revelations from the FAA about the MAX 737 jet. By: Sam Bourgi | Email | Leave a comment Shares of Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) declined sharply on Wednesday, under-performing the Dow by a wide margin amid revelations that U.S. regulators identified serious design flaws in the 737 MAX jet but still permitted it to fly. Boeing’s volatile stock price was down by as much as 2.7% on Wednesday, where it vastly under-performed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The blue-chip index declined by as much as 0.3% before paring losses later in the session. Boeing, which is the Dow’s largest component, reached an intraday low of $338.51 in New York trading before recovering north of $344.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allowed Boeing’s 737 MAX jet to keep flying after its first fatal crash in October 2018, even after regulators deemed it to be one of the most accident-prone airplanes in decades. FAA officials completed an internal assessment of the 737 MAX in November of last year, less than a month after a Lion Air flight plunged from the sky off Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board.

Here’s How Much You Could Be Making From Canadian Tire’s (TSX:CTC.A) Dividend,"      David Jagielski | December 11, 2019 | More on: CTC.A Dividend-growth stocks offer investors a great way to earn more on their initial investments over time. As long as you invest in a stock that has a strong business with good financials and a reputation for growing its payouts, you may be in a good position to continue to benefit from rising dividend payments. One stock that has been growing its dividend at a high rate in recent years is Canadian Tire (TSX:CTC.A). Currently, the stock pays a decent dividend yielding 3.1% per year. There are higher payouts that investors can earn out there today, but what makes Canadian Tire’s stock particularly attractive is the rate at which its dividend has grown in recent years. It recently hiked its dividend payments from $1.0375 every quarter to $1.1375 for an increase of 9.6%. Dividend hikes near 10% are always impressive, especially when they’ve been maintained over a longer period of time. Five years ago, Canadian Tire was paying its shareholders $0.525 every quarter. Since then, those payouts have more than doubled and are up a total of 117%. That averages out to an annual dividend increase of 16.7%. However, judging by its latest increase, which was under 10%, and the dividend yield now being more than 3%, it’s less likely that investors will see those higher rate hikes in the future. If you invest $10,000 in Canadian Tire stock today, that would be enough to own about 70 shares, meaning that you’d be earning about $319 a year in dividend income. In order to project how much that dividend income will be in five years, we need to first forecast what the rate hikes will be. With Canadian Tire reducing its rate of growth, a dividend increase may average a more modest 9% over the next five years. If that happens, then over the course of five years, dividend payments will rise by approximately 54%. That would increase the payouts from $1.1375 to $1.75. With 70 shares still held, you could be making $490 a year in dividend income. You would then be earning 4.9% of your original investment back in the form of dividends compared to the 3.1% yield that it offers today.

La industria de aerolíneas mejora en 2020 tras un año difícil (pdf)
Après une année difficile, amélioration prévue pour 2020 (pdf) Geneva - The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast that the global airline industry will produce a net profit of $29.3 billion in 2020, improved over a net profit of $25.9 billion expected in 2019 (revised downward from a $28 billion forecast in June). If achieved, 2020 will mark the industry's 11th consecutive year in the black. Highlights of expected 2020 performance include: Economic performance in 2019 was weaker than had been anticipated at the time of the June forecast. This aligns with weaker global GDP growth of 2.5% (versus 2.7% forecast in June) and world trade growth of just 0.9% (down from 2.5% forecast in June). These negative developments contributed to softer passenger and cargo demand and corresponding weaker revenue growth, as passenger yields fell 3.0% and cargo yields dropped 5.0% compared to 2018. Operating expenses did not rise as much as anticipated (3.8% vs. 7.4% June forecast) largely owing to lower-than-expected fuel costs; but this was not enough to offset the softness in revenue. ""Slowing economic growth, trade wars, geopolitical tensions and social unrest, plus continuing uncertainty over Brexit all came together to create a tougher than anticipated business environment for airlines. Yet the industry managed to achieve a decade in the black, as restructuring and cost-cutting continued to pay dividends. It appears that 2019 will be the bottom of the current economic cycle and the forecast for 2020 is somewhat brighter. The big question for 2020 is how capacity will develop, particularly when, as expected, the grounded 737 MAX aircraft return to service and delayed deliveries arrive,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's Director General and CEO. "" Economic Growth: GDP is forecast to expand by 2.7% in 2020 (marginally above the 2.5% growth in 2019). World trade growth is expected to rebound to 3.3% from 0.9% in 2019, as election year pressures in the USA contribute to reduced trade tensions. Growth is supported by actions from central banks as well as easing fiscal policy. Fuel Costs: Slower-than-expected global economic growth in 2019 contributed to lower energy demand, with crude oil prices averaging around $65 per barrel (Brent), compared to $71.60 in 2018. Oil supply is also plentiful, boosting inventories. As a result, oil prices are expected to dip","Dec 11, 2019",https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2019-12-11-01/
