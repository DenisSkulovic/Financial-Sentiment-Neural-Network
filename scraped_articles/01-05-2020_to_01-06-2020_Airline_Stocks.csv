0,Why Shares of American Airlines Fell 10% in 2019 | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of American Airlines Fell 10% in 2019. It was a tough year for the carrier viewed as most,"   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) lost 10.7% in 2019, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, a year in which the overall market and airline stocks on average gained more than 20%. American is widely seen as the weakest of the major U.S. carriers at present, and even though the industry is much healthier than it has been in years past, the airline's balance sheet and other issues, including its exposure to Boeing's ongoing troubles, were front of mind for investors through most of the year.  AIRLINE 2019 STOCK PERFORMANCE DATA BY YCHARTS American Airlines, the last of the major airlines to file for bankruptcy protection earlier in the decade and the last to participate in an industrywide round of consolidation that followed, has been playing catch-up for a number of years. And it faced a number of significant headwinds in 2019.  The airline during the year faced labor unrest and was among the carriers most affected by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX. AMERICAN AIRLINES HOPES TO GET OFF THE GROUND IN 2020. IMAGE SOURCE: AMERICAN AIRLINES. It also has the weakest balance sheets among major airlines, with more than $25 billion in long-term debt. That debt burden came into focus midyear as the yield on a 10-year Treasury bond fell below the two-year rate, creating a so-called inverted yield curve that many investors believe is a signal that a recession is imminent. Airlines historically have struggled during a downturn, and American, because of its debt and other issues, seemed particularly poorly suited for a slowdown. American clearly trails rivals including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines Holdings in terms of profitability and strength of balance sheet, and investors were likely correct to focus their attention away from the airline. But the fears about a recession have subsided, and even if they emerge again the days of a major airline collapsing during an economic downturn appear to be over. American might be the weakest link for now, but it is far from troubled. The company and its management team are taking much-needed steps to catch up. American is in the early days of revamping its route network and pricing strategies to improve profitability. And the company after a period of fleet renewal expects capital expenditures to come down in the years to come, freeing up cash to attack the debt load.

Fidelity Select Air,"Investors have a number of different investment vehicles available to them, so parking their money is easy to do. It's just a matter of understanding which one(s) make the most sense. Take mutual funds, for instance. These vehicles provide a highly liquid and diversified way to invest, and they're also the most popular choice for investors. Mutual funds cover a wide variety of industries and different asset classes. They're also popular because they reduce risk and are often actively managed, which means their holdings and asset allocations are readjusted on a fairly consistent basis. Some mutual funds concentrate on the transportation sector—a segment of the economy that focuses on companies that move goods and people. This sector also encompasses the infrastructure and equipment needed to do so. This article covers some of the basics of the sector as well as how the mutual fund industry invests in it. We also list four of the best-regarded funds specializing in transportation stocks. All figures current as of June 2020. The transportation industry is a sub-sector of the broad industrials market and includes companies operating airlines, trucking and railroad services. The majority of goods purchased by consumers and other businesses must travel from one location to another, making the transportation industry integral to an economic infrastructure. Transportation stocks are considered cyclical, meaning company profits flow in line with the movement of the overall economy. When markets are performing well, cyclical equities such as transportation company stocks tend to generate returns for consumers. Similarly, a downturn in the broader market leads to declining returns for shareholders of transportation industry stocks. A vast majority of the companies operating within the transportation sector are large and well-established, providing opportunities for investors to receive enhanced returns through consistent dividend payouts. Investors can utilize growth-oriented or value-oriented equities as a complement to other large cap and mid cap holdings, as both exist in abundance within the sector. While there are specific benefits made available to investors in the transportation industry, sector-focused investments are not without risk. There are plenty of growth-oriented and value-oriented equities to choose from within the transportation sector. The transportation industry is deeply affected by the fluctuating costs associated with fuel, interest rates, less-than-ideal weather, fuel surcharges and taxes, license and registration fees, and insurance premiums for required coverage.

5,Byron Wien makes some bold 2020 calls in his widely followed surprises list including 2 rate cuts,Byron Wien makes some bold 2020 calls in his widely followed surprises list including 2 rate cuts. Stocks rally after,"Blackstone Vice Chairman Byron Wien predicts in 2020 there will be no comprehensive trade deal and the Fed will be forced to cut interest rates twice because of an underperforming economy, but that the S&P 500 will still rebound to an all-time high despite increasingly volatile trading. These predictions are part of his often prescient “Ten Surprises” list, which has been a must-read on Wall Street since Wien, a 50-year veteran of Wall Street, began publishing it in the mid-1980s when he was chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. Over the course of 2020, he also envisions tech stocks — 2019′s top sector — underperforming the broader market, and airline stocks rallying as Boeing’s embattled 737 Max jet returns to the sky. On the geopolitical side, he thinks the United Kingdom will leave the European Union once and for all, and that tensions in the Middle East will rise. The list, which Wien now publishes together with Joe Zidle, chief investment strategist in Blackstone’s private wealth solutions group, compiles events that they view as “probable” — meaning a greater than 50% chance of occurring — that an average investor might view as having only a one in three chance of playing out. Looking ahead, Wien said that in 2020 a recession will be avoided, but that economic growth will fall short of estimates. This will prompt the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates twice by a quarter point (or one big cut) to 1%, down from the current range of 1.5% to 1.75%. “The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided,” the list states. “Federal Reserve Chair Powell lowers the Fed funds rate to 1%.” This would be a surprise to the market. The Fed said in December it expects to keep rates unchanged this year as the economy grows steadily and inflation picks up only slightly to its target range. On top of slowing economic growth, a Phase Two trade deal won’t be reached, they predict. In an effort to boost the economy, President Trump will use “every executive authority he has to stimulate growth,” which includes cutting payroll taxes. Wien said that the yield on the 10-year treasury will approach 2.5%, and that the yield curve will steepen. This is a widely followed metric on the Street, since recessions are typically preceded by a steepening of the yield curve.  Wien predicts that the S&P","Jan 6, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/06/byron-wien-makes-some-bold-2020-calls-in-his-widely-followed-surprises-list-including-2-rate-cuts.html

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies. Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels. In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment. One stock to keep an eye on is Delta Air Lines (DAL). DAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 8.41, while its industry has an average P/E of 10. Over the past 52 weeks, DAL's Forward P/E has been as high as 8.98 and as low as 7.16, with a median of 8.02. Investors should also note that DAL holds a PEG ratio of 0.70. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. DAL's industry has an average PEG of 0.71 right now. Over the last 12 months, DAL's PEG has been as high as 0.78 and as low as 0.43, with a median of 0.59. Another valuation metric that we should highlight is DAL's P/B ratio of 2.53. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. DAL's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.63.

7,3 Great Funds for New ETF Investors | Nasdaq,3 Great Funds for New ETF Investors. Invesco QQQ (QQQ). Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR). iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets," With over $4 trillion in domestic assets allocated to exchange traded funds and more than 2,000 exchange traded products (ETFs and ETNs) trading on U.S. exchanges, its fair to say plenty of investors are embracing ETFs. Data also confirm the ETF market is booming. Bank of America recently could top a stunning $50 trillion by 2030. Ã¢ÂÂThe current growth rate points to ETF assets approaching $50tn over the next decade driven by a continued move to passive and increased awareness of the attractive tax efficiency, cost, liquidity and transparency characteristics of ETFs,Ã¢ÂÂ BofA said in a note out in December. Of course, there are plenty of good ETFs out there and some that could , regardless of how long theyÃ¢ÂÂve been in the game. For investors new to the world of ETFs, here are some of the best funds to consider.   Expense ratio: 0.20% per year, or $20 on a $10,000 investment. Home to $87 billion in assets under management, the Invesco QQQ (NASDAQ:) is one of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs largest ETFs that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt hail from the iShares or Vanguard families. QQQ is one of the best funds for new ETF investors, particularly those on the younger side with long time horizons, because it offers broad-based, cost-effective exposure to many storied communication services and technology companies. For example, QQQ allocates over to Apple (NASDAQ:), Microsoft (NASDAQ:) and Amazon (NASDAQ:). With a 47.30% weight to tech stocks, QQQ is one of the best funds for investors that want to overweight that sector with the commitment of a dedicated technology ETF. Then there is the long-term performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, which, to put things simply, has been jaw-dropping. As of Dec. 13, 2019, Ã¢ÂÂon a cumulative price return basis, the NASDAQ-100 Index has returned almost 6,673.51% since inception (January 1985), although past performance is not indicative of future performance,Ã¢ÂÂ .   Expense ratio: 0.07% Conventional wisdom often dictates that for new investors, the best funds are that feature exposure to a massive number of stocks. That wisdom usually says thereÃ¢ÂÂs small-cap exposure in those funds. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs correct, but total market funds typically generate returns that are comparable to the S&P 500 or Russell 1000 indexes because smaller stocks have tiny weights in those products. What that means is that investors should isolate the size factor and do it in cost-effective fashion with ETFs such as the Vanguard Small-Cap","Jan 6, 2020",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-great-funds-for-new-etf-investors-2020-01-06

Airline stocks suffered from the sharper oil prices to offset energy firms’ gains. Easyjet sank three per cent and British Airways owner IAG dropped 3.3 per cent. By the early afternoon the FTSE had trimmed losses to stand at 7,559.6 points. Germany’s Dax performed even worse than the FTSE 100, however, suffering as much as a 1.7 per cent drop to 12,990 while France’s Cac sank as much as 1.25 per cent to 5,967 points. That followed an overnight plunge in Asian stocks, which baulked at the international incident. The Nikkei dropped 1.9 per cent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 0.8 per cent. US President Donald Trump threatened Iraq with sanctions overnight after Iraqi MPs voted on a resolution calling for US troops to leave their stations in the country, bringing joint operations against so-called Islamic State to a halt. Meanwhile European powers have urged all sides to show restraint. The UK, France and Germany said the violence “must be stopped” and said there was an “urgent need for de-escalation” in the Middle East. “Since Soleimani’s death via US-ordered drone strike, things have continued to escalate,” Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell said. “Investors are now faced with the prospect of weighing up whether this down move has further to go, or is just another opportunity to buy the dip,” CMC Markets chief analyst, Michael Hewson, added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with Trump yesterday about the crisis in a call in which the White House said the leaders “reaffirmed the close alliance” between the US and the UK. “The prospect of Iran avenging the killing of Soleimani and then a retaliation from the US is keeping de-escalation hopes at bay,” London Capital Group’s head of research, Jasper Lawler, said. “Defensive","Jan 6, 2020",https://www.cityam.com/ftse-100-falls-sharply-as-soleimani-death-rocks-stocks/

The airline industry in my opinion has surpassed it's boomtime. Once where passengers only have limited options, siding towards service rather than price between the tradeoffs of both, SIA thrived. However, with the entry of Low Cost Carriers, the monopolistic nature of Full Service Carriers have been threatened. Yes, LCC's won't fully replace FSC's, but now the pie has to be shared among more players. Millennials are going to be the highest contributors to tourism and when one identifies their spending behaviours, one would understand that they would rather spend more on authenticity rather than comfort and service therefore the market that SIA seeks to capture would still be its business travellers. Fuel prices, given how it is a finite resource, would tend to be on a rising trend, thus this would further increase the expense of airlines. It is seemingly hard for airlines to innovate to stay relevant and competitive over one another. From a consumer's perspective, passengers usually seek price, loyalty programmes and time slots when selecting flights and that can be achieved by any airline.

10,Jet Airways Share Price Locked In Upper Circuit After Synergy Group Resubmits EoI For Acquisition,. Jet Airways share price locked in upper circuit after Synergy Group resubmits EoI for acquisition. Jet is facing claims,"                                           Shares of Jet Airways were locked in 5 percent upper circuit on January 6 after a media report said that South American Synergy Group had again shown interest in acquiring the debt-laden airliner. The stock was quoting at Rs 35.90, up Rs 1.70, or 4.97 percent and there were pending buy orders for 24,345 shares, with no sellers available on the BSE at 1347 hours. The stock, which had closed 5 percent higher on January 3, has rallied 66 percent in the last one month on the hope of acquisition. Brazil-based Synergy Group had submitted an Expression of Interest to acquire grounded Jet Airways yet again, CNBC-TV18 said, citing multiple people aware of the development. Synergy Group had emerged as the sole contender for Jet Airways in the previous round of bidding but it did not submit a binding bid as it sought more time and several clarifications on the slots available for the airline among other things. Without any binding bid in place, the creditors committee for Jet Airways had earlier decided to invite fresh bids and even extended the deadline to submit Expressions of Interest to January 15, as per people aware of the matter. This will be the last attempt by the lenders to secure a bid for the airline and no further extensions may be granted, a senior banking executive told CNBC-TV18 on the condition of anonymity. If no bids were received in this round, liquidation may be considered, the banker said. Besides Synergy Group, banks are hopeful that two other suitors— a Dubai-based fund and the London-based Hinduja Group-- may also come forward, the report said. Jet is facing loan claims of over Rs 36,000 crore under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code from various creditors.

Self-inflicted injuries and Brexit uncertainty out the way, it was expected to provide a reasonably upbeat assessment of prospects on Wednesday alongside its trading update. However, America's drone assassination of Iran's military leader Qassem Soleimani has put paid to that with oil prices soaring in its wake, hiking the cost of jet fuel. The FTSE 100-listed group was just enjoying some respite with upgrades to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ by both HSBC and Citi Group last month. But on Monday IAG and its peers Ryanair Holdings plc (LON:RYA), Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) and easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) were down between 2% and 3%.

Investors have become jittery about the impact Iran’s retaliation could have on the US stock market, but how much pain will there really be? By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. The US is awash with speculation on how Iran will retaliate to the US airstrike that killed Qassem Soleimani. The news of Soleimani’s death took stock markets markedly lower and caused investors to flee for safe-haven investments. Investors fear that Iran’s response will have an even greater impact on the US stock market in the months ahead. The most likely outcome is a rise in conflict with Shiite militia groups in Iraq. These fighters could target US officials and civilians in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani likened Soleimani’s killing to the 1953 US-led coup against Iran’s government, which eventually led to 52 US diplomats being taken hostage for more than a year.  That particular incident holds a few takeaways for traders trying to predict how Iran’s response will impact the US stock market. The most important is timing. The US helped overthrow Iran’s democratically elected government in 1953; the hostage crisis took place in 1979. Several other US actions fueled Iranian hostility toward the US, but it’s worth noting that in this case, the retaliation came more than two decades later.

Here are 10 reasons why. By: Josiah Wilmoth | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. The US stock market kicked off the new decade with a bang. But after ringing in the new year at all-time highs, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suddenly feels a lot more bearish. Here are ten reasons why it may be time to put the brakes on those rosy 2020 forecasts. After President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike that killed Iran’s top military leader, it wasn’t long before “World War 3” began trending on Twitter. Similarly, Google searches for “World War 3” surged to all-time highs over the weekend, smashing the previous peak by an absurd margin. The mania was little more than pure hyperbole. But the meteoric rise in Middle East tensions threatens to inject severe volatility into financial markets nonetheless. Historical evidence suggests that stocks will eventually stabilize after jittery investors recover from the initial shock. The risk is that the fallout from Qassem Soleiman’s death serves as the domino that ignites a correction in a stock market already plagued by expensive valuations and lackluster corporate earnings. US-Iran tensions will inevitably spark volatility in the Dow and other major stock indices, but some analysts say the market’s outlook was deceptively bleak even before Soleimani’s killing. Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, warns that investors have become too greedy following 2019’s spectacular equities rally.

15,Here’s why the Qantas share price is falling out of the sky,. . . . . . . . . Here’s why the Qantas share price is falling out of the,"      Sebastian Bowen | January 6, 2020 1:48pm | More on: QAN ASX 200 It’s not a happy day on the markets today as we start the first full week of the new year and decade. The S&P/ASX 200 (INDEXASX: XJO) is down around 0.52% today (at the time of writing) and most shares on the market are trending lower. But a standout loser today is the Qantas Airways Limited (ASX: QAN) share price. QAN shares closed last week at $7.19, but today have opened at $7.01 (a drop of 2.5%). The pain hasn’t stopped there and Qantas shares have trended lower since – swapping hands for $7 at the time of writing after going as low as $6.96 earlier this morning.  So why has Qantas felt the pain of this market dip more acutely than most? Well, it’s to do with the reason the markets as a whole are falling: tensions in the Middle East. The US attacks on the Iranian military have spooked global markets in general – no one likes an increased likelihood of war, after all. But since the tensions surround the Middle East, the price of crude oil has been responding sharply. Bloomberg reports that the price of West Texas Intermediate crude is now at US$64.20 a barrel, whilst Brent Crude is going for around US$70 a barrel – its highest level since April last year. This time last month, Brent was asking just US$60 a barrel. But why does this affect Qantas? Well, the airline’s largest fixed cost happens to be jet fuel – which is directly tied to the price of oil. Out of the $16.48 billion in total operating expenses that Qantas had in FY19, fuel costs made up $3.85 billion of that total, or 23.34%. So a spike in oil prices directly hits Qantas where it hurts – the bottom line. And that’s why investors have been pushing their Qantas shares out the door this morning. If tensions in the Middle East escalate further and push up oil price even more, there is nothing but pain in Qantas’ immediate future. It’s clear many investors don’t want to wait around for this to happen – especially as Qantas shares are coming off record highs that we saw around Christmas. Thus, unless crude prices reverse their recent gains, I don’t see much short-term upside in QAN shares.","Jan 6, 2020",https://www.fool.com.au/2020/01/06/heres-why-the-qantas-share-price-is-falling-out-of-the-sky/

17,Australia’s Wildfires Hurt Nation’s Biggest Names Such as Qantas - Bloomberg,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"Australia’s deadly bushfire crisis is affecting some of the nation’s biggest companies including dairy producer Bega Cheese Ltd. and airline Qantas Airways Ltd. Bega led declines on the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index on Monday after the company said fires have impacted a number of employees and dairy farm suppliers in New South Wales’ Bega Valley region. Shares plunged 9.3% in Sydney trading, the most since Oct. 29. Qantas shares tumbled after the airline canceled several flights via Canberra on Sunday due to bushfire smoke. The stock dropped 2.6% on Monday to its lowest level since Nov. 18. Produce company Costa Group Holdings Ltd. declined for a second day after Vitalharvest, which leases citrus and berry assets exclusively to Costa Group, said on Friday that the fires burning in southern New South Wales have affected its Tumbarumba berry farm. Costa Group shares slid 3.2% on Monday. Bushfires in Victoria’s East Gippsland have delayed work on Cooper Energy’s Sole Gas Project for an estimated two weeks, the company said in a statement on Monday.

The company expects revenue and net operating income from both properties to take a hit of at least A$500,000 ($347,250), according to a statement on Monday.

Weirdest Economy Ever Hyundai Development Company (HDC) and Mirae Asset Daewoo (MAD) were “selected” in November by the Korean government as “preferred bidders” to purchase a large share in the country’s second largest airline, Asiana, whose financial troubles we have previously covered. Asiana’s financial situation has been steadily deteriorating: Total debt at the end of the first half of 2019 ballooned to 9.6 trillion won, or over $8.2 billion, and passenger numbers to the once profitable Korea to Japan routes have been reduced to a mere trickle. These are terrible numbers that should have long sent Asiana into bankruptcy protection and executives in damage control mode, as Asiana is apparently underreporting lease costs as well. However, this is not about rescuing an airline that is likely to keep on losing money for years but about bailing out the Kumho-Asiana chaebol (family-owned conglomerate) which is sinking under the weight of its enormous debts: proceeds from this sale won’t go toward paying Asiana creditors but entirely to Kumho. It’s expected HDC and MAD will pay Kumho about 2.5 trillion won (over $2.1 billion) for a 31% share in the airline, most likely more than the whole airline is worth. In 2018, Kumho-Asiana had already been forced to sell a 45% stake in their tire division, Kumho Tires, for $600 million to Qingdao Doublestar to raise quick cash and avoid bankruptcy. As the Korean government organized and oversaw this operation every step of the way, this is yet another act in the massive bailout of the country’s conglomerates which started in 2016 with a huge stimulus package aimed at the country’s financially troubled maxi-shipyards and that shows no sign of slowing down. In December, the Indian government, after many changes of heart, finally announced they are going to get rid of the entirety of Air India by seeking to sell 100% of the money-losing airline. Air India is reportedly sitting on $10 billion in debt and in 2019 was cut off from fuel supplies at several airports due to unpaid bills by the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) before the government stepped in with a bridge loan. All previous attempts to privatize parts of Air India met with complete lack of interest: Besides the company’s financial woes, prospective buyers were no doubt scared away by","Jan 5, 2020",https://wolfstreet.com/2020/01/05/2020-already-the-year-of-zombie-airlines/
