USD/JPY.,"                                                   Investors in Spirit Airlines Incorporated (NYSE: SAVE) are awaiting fourth-quarter results from the airline in early February. Ahead of the earnings report, here's a look at a few top reasons two analysts are bullish on the stock: Although the company is sizable, it still has a lot of potential for growth. Historically, the larger a company gets, the slower it grows. The company expects to grow 17-19% in just in 2020 alone. It has no exposure to the 737 Max grounding. A lot of other airlines bought a fleet of Boeing Co (NYSE: BA)'s grounded 737 Max, including American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV), which impacted their profits. Future M&A is likely. A potential merger with Frontier Airlines could happen, according to Buckingham analyst Daniel McKenzie. While nothing is imminent, the two teamed up, the combined company would be a formidable competitor, the analyst said. Loyalty is everything. The company is rolling out a new loyalty program that will hopefully bring in more repeat customers. The cost performance of the airline is improving. The trend in revenue per available seat mile minus cost per available seat mile excluding fuel is coming in stronger than anticipated, according to Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent, meaning profit efficiency is improving.

The $1.30 including a 10 cent discrete tax benefit. Revenue was well above Wall Street forecasts, with firmwide revenue exceeding $10 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter. Southwest Airlines (LUV) – Southwest took Boeing’s (BA) grounded 737 Max jet off its flight schedule through June 6. XPO Logistics (XPO) – XPO is considering a sale of the company or a spin-off of one or more business units. Such a move would reverse recent strategy for the provider of warehousing and delivery services, which made 17 acquisitions from 2011 to 2015. Tesla (TSLA) – Tesla saw vehicle registrations in California cut nearly in half during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a year earlier. That decline comes amid a significant drop in federal tax credits for electric vehicle buyers during 2019. Separately, Tesla was downgraded to “underweight” from “equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley, which pointed to the recent stock run-up as well as long term risks to the automaker’s China business.

Alcoa (AA) – Alcoa lost 31 cents per share for the fourth quarter, wider than the 22 cents a share loss that analysts had been expecting.

3,"Beyond Meat can turn 'very, very bearish' if it hits this level","For Beyond Meat, breaching this level would be ‘very, very bearish,’ says analyst. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC","Beyond Meat bears have had a bad streak. Shares of the fake meat maker have skyrocketed nearly 52% since this month, a massive gain buoyed by Main Street’s meatless mania and a welcome reprieve from the stock’s collapse in the second half of last year. Shares fell 4% Wednesday morning, following a downgrade from Bernstein. Trading in the stock was halted briefly on Tuesday to mitigate volatility. Beyond Meat has proved challenging for its short-sellers, who are currently short roughly 40% of the float but frequently find themselves caught in short squeezes. A short squeeze is when investors who are betting a stock will go lower — short-sellers — instead see the stock rise and are forced to cover their bets, which can send the stock even higher. For Bill Baruch, founder and president of Blue Line Capital and Blue Line Futures, the key level to watch in Beyond Meat is $70 a share. The stock was around $112 in early Wednesday trading. “A close below 70 is very, very bearish,” Baruch told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday, pointing to the chart of Beyond Meat’s stock since the initial public offering last May.  “In looking at this chart, this surge I believe has run its course,” the technical analyst said. “This is not quite a dead-cat bounce, but this run, I think, is now exhausted and, ultimately, from here, you also have resistance at 135.” Based on Baruch’s Fibonacci analysis — adopted from the mathematician who spotted repetitive patterns in nature that also tend to occur in the stock market — $135 is something of a ceiling for Beyond Meat’s stock because it represents a 38.2% retracement of the recent downtrend, which is one of Fibonacci’s key ratios, the analyst said. ″[If] you get a close above 135, it could get some legs,” Baruch said. “I’m still not a believer.” Quint Tatro, chief investment officer at Joule Financial, said in the same “Trading Nation” interview that while Beyond Meat’s story is “interesting,” that’s all it is: a story. “From a fundamental standpoint, it’s very difficult for us to get behind this name. It’s not profitable. Exceptional sales growth, but pure speculation,” Tatro said. “I’m a fan of the company. I’ve tried the burgers. I’ve tried the sausages. I mean, it’s great. But from a fundamental investment standpoint, they’ve got to be profitable. They’ve got to have positive cash flow.","Jan 15, 2020",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/15/beyond-meat-can-turn-very-very-bearish-if-it-hits-this-level.html

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is Public Joint Stock Company Aeroflot - Russian Airlines (MCX:AFLT) which saw its share price drive 178% higher over five years. And in the last week the share price has popped 5.1%. Check out our latest analysis for Aeroflot - Russian Airlines There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. During the last half decade, Aeroflot - Russian Airlines became profitable. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. In fact, the Aeroflot - Russian Airlines stock price is 32% lower in the last three years. During the same period, EPS grew by 5.6% each year. So there seems to be a mismatch between the positive EPS growth and the change in the share price, which is down -12% per year. The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). We know that Aeroflot - Russian Airlines has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts. When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Aeroflot - Russian Airlines, it has a TSR of 240% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the","Jan 16, 2020",https://simplywall.st/stocks/ru/transportation/mcx-aflt/aeroflot-russian-airlines-shares/news/if-you-had-bought-aeroflot-russian-airlines-mcxaflt-stock-five-years-ago-you-could-pocket-a-178-gain-today
5,2 Top Transportation Stocks to Buy in January | Nasdaq,2 Top Transportation Stocks to Buy in January. UPS to gain from rival's pain. This airline stock's already flying higher.,"Transportation companies might be the backbone of an economy, but stocks in the sector don't always get the attention they deserve, partly because of the ""boring"" nature of the business. 2019, however, proved to be a great year for the sector if the performance of the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF is anything to go by. The ETF, also among the top transportation ETFs with exposure to every industry within the sector, has returned a handsome 21.7% return in the past one year. That's not to say every industry within the sector is booming. On the contrary, trucking, railroads, and shipping companies are facing different kinds of challenges, not limited to a weakening freight market, a steep fall in coal shipments, and trade tensions. So if I were to buy transportation stocks now, I'd look at companies operating in other industries, like Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS). Here's why these airlines and logistics stocks are my top transportation picks now. Transportation stocks broadly include companies that move goods, from raw material to finished, from one place to another. Logistics companies, therefore, form an important link. E-commerce's potential rise, in particular, offers a lot of promise for logistics companies like United Parcel Service. Of late though, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has emerged as a major threat to the traditional logistics companies thanks to its own foray into delivery and logistics. But where things stand now, Amazon is causing bigger troubles for UPS's rival FedEx (NYSE: FDX), making the former an interesting stock to own. Image source: Getty Images. FedEx shares took a hard hit in 2019 after the company broke off ties with longtime partner Amazon. FedEx, which was still serving third-party sellers on Amazon, received another huge blow in December when Amazon barred such sellers from using FedEx Ground for its Prime shipments during peak shopping season citing performance concerns. Meanwhile, Amazon's partnership with UPS is intact so far, giving the latter an undeniable edge over its rival. For the nine months through September 2019, UPS reported 6.7% growth in revenue from its largest segment, U.S. Domestic Package. During the company's third-quarter earnings release, CEO David Abney even went on to say how he sees ""significant near-term benefits to both top- and bottom-line results in the U.S. and continued momentum into the future.""

South African Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United","Your weekly economic review The major event, this week, has been the announcement of voluntary administration of Air Mauritius. Its share price had gained 20 cents to Rs 5.80 prior to the announcement. The Stock Exchange of Mauritius has since suspended trading on the airline The stock exchange session this week, according to reports of AXYS Stockbroking, has been marked by continuous slump. Put aside the fact that Air Mauritius has been put under voluntary administration on Wednesday because of financial difficulties.   The Board of Directors of Air Mauritius Limited met on the 22nd of April to take cognizance of the latest financial status of the Company. In light of the recent developments worldwide relating to the COVID-19 crisis, the company has been placed under voluntary administration. Its share price had gained 20cts to Rs 5.80 prior to the announcement. The Stock Exchange of Mauritius has since suspended trading on the airline According to the communiqué issued by Air Mauritius, the immediate future remains uncertain, mostly in relation to the COVID-19 crisis: It was noted that, in January 2020, the Board had set up a Transformation Steering Committee with a view to addressing the financial difficulties of the Company and to reviewing its business model for ensuring a sustainable future. Wide consultations were held with all concerned stakeholders and substantial progress was made in formulating the Action Plan to be recommended to the Board.  Unfortunately, travel restrictions and the closure of borders in all our markets and cessation of all international and domestic flights in an unprecedented crisis, has led to a complete erosion of the Company’s revenue base. Furthermore, there is uncertainty as to when international air traffic will resume and all indications tend to show that normal activities will not pick up until late 2020.  In these circumstances, it is expected that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations in the foreseeable future. The Board, therefore, took the decision to place the Company under voluntary administration in order to safeguard the interest of the Company and that of all its stakeholders.

11,How Delta Is Tackling 3 Big Business Risks | The Motley Fool,How Delta Is Tackling 3 Big Business Risks. The global carrier is trimming its exposure as its operations improve.. 1.,"   Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) enjoyed a solid 3% bump in its share price on Wednesday, after reporting fourth-quarter 2019 earnings that included an impressive revenue advance of 6.5% to $11.4 billion, and an accompanying 7.8% improvement in net income, to $1.1 billion. But in line with other airline carriers, Delta has yet to command a premium to the market: Shares trade at just 8 times forward earnings.  Why hasn't vibrant earnings power been reflected in Delta's stock price? Part of investors' hesitation can be traced to a fear that the cyclical airline business will be one of the first industries to suffer should the U.S. economy slip into a recession. Delta has managed, however, to alleviate some of the risk associated with a cyclical downturn. Here, we'll discuss two of Delta's actions that will mitigate the impact of a potential economic slowdown, as well as its work on one additional general business risk, using comments drawn from the company's post-earnings conference call on Tuesday. Delta's investment-grade balance sheet remains an important competitive advantage. Including the debt we raised during the quarter, our leverage ratio was 1.7 times at year-end. This puts us at the low end of our targeted adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR range of 1.5 to 2.5 times. -- Paul Jacobson, CFO As airlines build capacity, they tend to load up their balance sheets with long-term debt, and when the industry hits one of its cyclical troughs, declining cash flows often can't meet required debt service, leading to serial airline bankruptcies. Delta has been fairly careful about adding leverage to its balance sheet. The company's financial debt-to-equity ratio has hovered in a safe zone of 20% to 30% over the past five years. As Jacobson says, Delta's adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio indicates moderate leverage and sits at the lower end of management's debt tolerance range. ""EBITDAR"" is simply a variation of EBITDA that adds rent (operating-lease payments) back to earnings. Hence the ""R"" tacked onto EBITDA. Abundant cash flow from operations is a primary factor in Delta's ability to avoid crippling debt, and it's helped make it one of the few major airlines to carry the enviable ""investment grade"" label bestowed by major ratings agencies, as Jacobson alludes to. The carrier has generated a cool $8.5 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

12,"Jet Airways Insolvency: The Good, The Bad And The Ugly",". Jet Airways insolvency: The good, the bad and the ugly. While expression of interest from two suitors is encouraging,","                                            The good news. Jet Airways has got an expression of interest (EoI) from two suitors - South America’s Synergy Group and New Delhi-based Prudent ARC Ltd. The bad news? Many of the questions around the revival of the airline still remain. While Synergy submitted its interest on January 6, little-known Prudent ARC put in the EoI on January 15, the deadline. The interest would come as a relief for Jet Airways lenders, who are hoping to recover more than Rs 8,000 crore in dues. The airline’s total liability is over Rs 20,000 crore. The airline suspended operations in April. The two suitors will now go through the eligibility test. If they clear the hurdle, they will need to submit bids by February 17. The doubts For Synergy, which emerged as the sole suitor for Jet Airways in September, this would be familiar territory. In 2019, too, the group submitted its EoI but failed to submit a bid despite several extensions in deadlines. Importantly, many of the questions around its interest remain. It still has not got an Indian partner, which is necessary to qualify as a bidder. Indian regulations allow foreign companies only 49 percent stake in airlines, and the operational control also remains with the local partner. Despite reaching out to many companies, Synergy is yet to get a partner. The group also asked for clarity on Jet Airways’ slots and flying rights, which had been distributed among the likes of IndiGo, SpiceJet and Vistara. While industry regulator DGCA has said it will “positively consider” requests, it is subject to “concrete business plans.” On that front, Synergy, with its own financial woes, is yet to show its cards. New interest While an interest from a new suitor is always welcome to bring fresh interest in a bidding process, little is known about Prudent ARC. The relatively-new company got approvals to start business only in 2016. It is not known to have expertise in aviation. Reports add that the company may not clear the eligibility test as it does not have a net worth of Rs 2,000 crore. It may be a different story if Prudent","Jan 16, 2020",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-insolvency-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-4822441.html
13,Delta Air Lines Share Price Flies High After Strong Full-Year Earnings and Beating Quarterly Expectations Again (DAL) | Stock Investor,. . Delta Air Lines Share Price Flies High After Strong Full-Year Earnings And Beating Quarterly Expectations Again (DAL). NED,"Welcome to the newly redesigned StockInvestor.com - The Go-To Resource For Investing Advice And Information January 16, 2020 @ 1:21 pm Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) has recovered most of its share price losses since its recent all-time high in July 2019 and is looking to continue this advancement and the uptrend on positive financial results for the last quarter and full-year 2020. Delta’s current share price still has more than 10% room on the upside before it reaches Wall Street analysts’ average target price of $67.83. Because of this room for growth and the anticipation that Delta will build on its year-end results with another better-than-expected financial report for the first quarter, all 18 of the analysts that are currently covering the Delta stock have a “Buy” (11) or a “Strong Buy” (7) recommendation.   On January 14, 2020, Delta Air Lines reported its fourth-quarter and year-end results for 2019. In the last quarter of the year, Delta generated $11.44 billion in total revenue, which was a 6% increase over the same period during the previous year. Passenger services accounted for nearly  90% of total revenue and advanced at the same 6% overall growth rate. While cargo revenue declined by 13% for the period, that segment had minimal impact as its accounts for just slightly more than 1% of Delta’s total revenue. A reduction of 14% due to aircraft fuel costs and related taxes drove gross profit 28% higher from $1.1 billion in the same period last year to the $1.4 billion in the last period of 2019. Earnings advanced 8% from $1.02 billion to $1.1 billion, or $1.71 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.70 came in above the $1.20 to $1.50 guidance and beat analysts’ expectations of $1.40 by more than 21%. Including the fourth quarter of 2019, Delta has beaten analysts’ quarterly earnings estimates in all of the past five consecutive periods. Full-year revenues of $47 billion for 2019 were $2.57 billion, or 6% higher than in 2018. While not as high as the 14% quarterly reduction, 6% lower fuel costs saved $500 million for the year. Additionally, ancillary businesses and refinery cost reduction added another $450 million to create cost savings of nearly $1 billion from just those two line items. They also drove gross profit 26% higher from $5.23 billion in 2018 to $6.65 billion for the most recent","Jan 16, 2020",https://www.stockinvestor.com/46183/delta-air-lines-share-price-flies-high-after-strong-full-year-earnings-and-beating-quarterly-expectations-again-dal/

16,The bull and bear case for investing in Boeing during the 737 MAX crisis. | Fortune,Why Boeing’s shares are holding up despite a brutal year. The bearish case. The bullish case. More must-read stories from,"January 15, 2020 4:45 PM GMT+2      In a year of bad news—followed by yet more bad news—Tuesday was an extraordinary day for Boeing and its battered shareholders. Consider this rundown of headlines: First, news broke that rival Airbus overtook Boeing in 2019, delivering more than twice as many airplanes—863 to 380—to customers last year. Dig deeper into the numbers and some real red flags appear for Boeing. The struggling aviation and defense giant reported that in 2019, for the first time in decades, it had a negative net number of commercial airplane orders. In other words, cancellations outpaced deliveries by 87 as airline customers continued to move on from the grounded Boeing 737 MAX.  Also on Tuesday, American Airlines announced it would keep the 737 MAX out of commission for a further two months, until June. And, to put a further exclamation point on the day, evidence surfaced that Boeing talked Lion Air out of more 737 MAX training for its pilots, generating further questions about whether Boeing did everything it could to keep pilots safe in the run-up to the two fatal MAX crashes that killed 346. All in all, it was one heck of a second day on the job for new CEO David Calhoun. And yet, with all that bad new, shares closed up 0.65%, outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. Through all the turmoil of firing its CEO, congressional testimony, and its finances going south, the trading dynamics for Boeing's stock have remained remarkably steady over the past 10 months. Yes, there's been a 25% drop in the Boeing share price since its record high of $440.62 on March 1, 2019. But zoom out, and you see the share price is holding up fine. It's trading 10% above where it was in December, 2018, when the markets swooned, and it's more than twice as high as it was just three years ago. If you bought Boeing shares on January, 2, 2017, you'd be pretty happy right now with the return. A couple of factors have put a floor on the shares, at least for now. And, market watchers believe, the company is at a crossroads. It's primed either to take off, or to drop further. Fortune looks closely at what would trigger both scenarios. Equity investing is not supposed to work this way. Bad news drives down","Jan 15, 2020",https://fortune.com/2020/01/15/boeing-shares-airbus-max/

Information Technology[edit]. Contribution to open source projects[edit].,"Amadeus IT Group, S.A. /ˌæməˈdeɪəs aɪ ˈtiː/ is a major Spanish IT provider for the global travel and tourism industry. The company is structured around two areas: its global distribution system and its Information Technology business. Amadeus provides search, pricing, booking, ticketing and other processing services in real-time to travel providers and travel agencies through its Amadeus CRS distribution business area. It also offers computer software that automates processes such as reservations, inventory management software and departure control systems. It services customers including airlines, hotels, tour operators, insurers, car rental and railway companies, ferry and cruise lines, travel agencies and individual travellers directly. Amadeus processed 945 million billable travel transactions in 2011.[3] The parent company of Amadeus IT Group, holding over 99.7% of the firm, is Amadeus IT Holding S.A. It was listed on the Spanish stock exchanges on 29 April 2010.[4] Amadeus has central sites in Madrid, Spain (corporate headquarters and marketing), Sophia Antipolis, France (product development), London, UK (product development), Breda, Netherlands (development), Erding, Germany (Data center) and Bangalore, India (product development) as well as regional offices in Boston, Bangkok, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Miami, Istanbul, Singapore, and Sydney.[5][6] At market level, Amadeus maintains customer operations through 173 local Amadeus Commercial Organisations (ACOs) covering 195 countries. The Amadeus group employs 14,200 employees worldwide,[7] and listed in Forbes' list of ""The World's Largest Public Companies"" as No. 985.[8] Amadeus was originally created as a neutral global distribution system (GDS) by Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa and SAS in 1987 in order to connect providers' content with travel agencies and consumers in real time. The creation of Amadeus was intended to offer a European alternative to Sabre, an American GDS. The first Amadeus system was built from core reservation system code coming from System One, an American GDS that competed with Sabre but went bankrupt, and a copy of the Air France pricing engine. These systems were respectively running under IBM TPF and Unisys. At the beginning of Amadeus, the Amadeus systems were functionally dedicated to airline reservation and centered on the PNR (Passenger Name Record), the passenger's travel file. Throughout the years, the PNR was opened up to additional travel industries (hotels, rail, cars, cruises, ferries, insurance, etc.). Although established initially as a private partnership, Amadeus went public in October 1999, becoming listed on the Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid stock exchanges. Progressively and in line with industry evolution, Amadeus diversified its","Jan 15, 2020",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_IT_Group

The Dow Jones surged to a record high on Thursday as momentum erased lingering fears over the enforceability of the phase one deal. By: Francois Aure | Email | Leave a comment The Dow Jones pushed further into record territory on Thursday after U.S. retail sales hit their target and jobless claims dropped unexpectedly. A euphoric U.S. stock market is basking in the possibility of more tax cuts and the de-escalation of the trade war. But the rally in the Dow ignores lingering concerns about the enforceability of the phase one deal. The three major US stock market indices rose in unison. Less than 45 minutes before the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed 205.32 points or 0.71% to 29,236.19. The S&P 500 rose 0.62% to 3,309.85, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied 0.77% to 9,330.34. In keeping with the strong demand for risk-assets, crude oil jumped 1.1%. The price of gold suffered from its safe-haven status with a 0.13% decline. The trade war between the U.S. and China weighed on the Dow for more than a year, but the actual impact on the stock market receded when it became apparent Trump was keen to de-escalate the situation for a political win ahead of the 2020 election. Current tariffs have not hindered Wall Street profits too much, and the bulls are chasing another carrot in the form of more tax cuts from the Trump campaign.   With fewer geopolitical headlines to worry about, investors can focus more on the macro","Jan 16, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/dow-smashes-record-as-animal-spirits-seize-the-u-s-stock-market/
