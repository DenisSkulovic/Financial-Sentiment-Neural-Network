0,Why Airline Stocks Were Falling Last Month | The Motley Fool,"Why Airline Stocks Were Falling Last Month. Carriers including Delta, United, Spirit, and Ryanair were all falling by double digits","   Airline stocks were losing altitude last month as trade tensions caused investors to sour on the macroeconomically sensitive sector, and the effects from Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX grounding continued to linger. Among the stocks heading lower, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, were Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which fell 11.7%, United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL), which lost 12.6%, Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE), which was off 15.3%, and Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY), which was down 16%. As the chart below shows, the stocks mostly fell in tandem with the S&P 500, which ended May down 6.6%.  UAL DATA BY YCHARTS. Airlines aren't directly impacted by tariffs the way, say, manufacturers are, since these companies provide a service rather than selling a concrete product. However, travel tends to be highly sensitive to the overall economy, because businesses and vacationers scale back on costly air travel in tough times. And the rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China -- and now Mexico -- have sparked fear that global economic growth could slow down as a result. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. A lot changed on the trade front in May. Going into the month, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. and China were in the ""final laps"" of an agreement. However, talks broke down, and President Trump said he would raise tariffs from 10% to 25% on the $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that were already being taxed and threatened to impose them on a separate category of $325 billion in Chinese goods. China responded in turn by promising to tariff $60 billion of American imports. Tensions temporarily heightened when the administration blacklisted Huawei, the Chinese smartphone maker, though it revised that policy the next day, delaying its implementation for 90 days. At the end of the month, Trump expanded the trade war to Mexico, threatening to impose escalating tariffs on that country if it did not do more to stop the flow of migrants into the U.S. Today, the U.S. appears to be at an impasse in negotiations with both China and Mexico. Delta tried to tamp down some concerns about the trade war, saying that revenues on U.S.-China flights are up 25% this year even though the number of Chinese visitors to the U.S. is now on the decline. Meanwhile, tariffs on Airbus, the European airplane manufacturer and Boeing rival, could also add costs to airlines, since orders","Jun 9, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/09/why-airline-stocks-were-falling-last-month.aspx
1,Is Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) An Attractive Dividend Stock?,. . . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD.

Today we'll take a closer look at Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) from a dividend investor's perspective. Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter. A 1.4% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests Southwest Airlines has some staying power. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 7.2% of market capitalisation this year. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Southwest Airlines! Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 15% of Southwest Airlines's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. Given the low payout ratio, it is hard to envision the dividend coming under threat, barring a catastrophe. We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Southwest Airlines's cash payout ratio last year was 10%. Cash flows are typically lumpy, but this looks like an appropriately conservative payout. It's positive to see that Southwest Airlines's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.","Jun 10, 2019",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-co-nyse-luv-153240298.html

CNBC Newsletters,"Defense stocks were on the move Monday after Raytheon and United Technologies agreed to merge. A combined company would generate $74 billion in annual sales, making it the second-largest aerospace and defense company in the U.S. While President Donald Trump expressed concern a deal could make the industry less competitive, Raytheon CEO Tom Kennedy tells CNBC the two companies are more like partners than competitors. “We’re complementary. We’re not competitive,” said Kennedy. “They have some complementary technologies, we bring together with our technologies to go to the marketplace. In this case here, we’re going to be able to take about $8 billion of research and development spend and our 60,000 engineers to develop the next-level technologies to create the next generation franchises so we can go to the international/global marketplace and win those markets and then bring that stuff back to the U.S. to create more jobs.” Sheila Kahyaoglu, aerospace and defense analyst at Jefferies, says companies in the industry see mergers as the best way forward. “It reminds us a lot of Harris and L3. You have to keep moving to get ahead. If you think about the budget, it’s $730 billion so not an Uber-sized addressable market … it’s still off of a very low base, so we have a good addressable market. It’s just these companies are seeing a way of merging, and bigger is better, and defense seems to be the theme.” Ron Epstein, research analyst at Bank of America, sees a formidable player in the industry once the merger goes through. “The underlying point of this transaction is a couple things. One, for United Technologies, basically they’re swapping out Otis elevator and Carrier air conditioner for Raytheon. And no offense to Otis and Carrier, but Raytheon is a far superior asset. So with the spinout of those companies from UTC, Mr. Hayes has rebuilt this portfolio to a technology juggernaut. The combination here ... a defensive, high-tech portfolio, it really is a spectacular combination.” Tim Lesko, principal at Granite Investment Advisors, says sell-offs have presented buying opportunities for companies and investors. “For a long time, it’s felt like the defense stocks have been a little bit overvalued. We have owned Boeing and United Technologies for a long time and we’ve long looked at things like Raytheon but they were trading at premiums to the market.

5,"American Airlines Executives Throw Away Cash, Buy More AAL Stock - Live and Let's Fly","AMERICAN AIRLINES EXECUTIVES THROW AWAY CASH, BUY MORE AAL STOCK. Executives Buy More AAL Stock. Sign of Hubris. Sign of","This week American Airlines senior executives loaded their personal coffers with even more American Airlines stock (AAL). Was it a sign of hubris or idiocy?  If you haven’t followed us on Facebook or Instagram, add us today. Six top American Airlines executives lit their own cash on fire for once and bought more American Airlines stock (AAL) near three-year lows. CEO and Chairman of the Board Doug Parker led the way with 50,000 shares to bring his total to 2.2 MM shares – he is compensated solely in stock but this purchase was from his personal holdings. American Airlines President, Robert Isom, lit more than $400,000 on fire in exchange for 15,000 AAL shares; another four executives blazed through $600,000 of their personal cash in the purchase. The Moronic Six issued a joint statement on the purchase: “These share purchases are not part of our compensation package. They were purchased solely because of the value we see in American today and over time.” In fairness to them, if you believe in what you’re doing and think the outcome will pay off in the end, why not double down with the stock is on its back. It shows investors that they have confidence in their plans, the company as a whole and are willing to put their money where their mouths are. If the stock was at an all-time low and they weren’t investing more of their wealth in it, wouldn’t that rather be a sign to dump the stock further? Idiocy is a strong word and I chose it carefully. American Airlines executive team have been trending the wrong way. American Airlines is the only major carrier in the US not making money from flying, they have a worse on-time rating than Spirit – even Allegiant made money (at a 22% margin, no less) from flying despite their terrible press and recovering safety record. The carrier has no distinguishable advantage over the competition. Their loyalty program is not better than Delta nor United. At most of their hubs, they find some amount of competition. In Dallas, they fight Southwest at Love Field vs. DFW, Chicago splits traffic with United and Southwest at Midway, Reagan National faces United at Dulles, Miami has even international competition at Fort Lauderdale.

Just about every expert and their cohort are calling for the market to implode. Maybe it’s time to consider the alternative scenario? As the longest bull market in U.S. history continues its relentless run, that old cliché seems more relevant than ever: “The market can stay irrational a lot longer than you can stay solvent.” There is a poster child for all this stock market madness, and it comes in the form of the Japanese asset bubble of the late 1980s. In only three years, the Nikkei 225, Japan’s benchmark financial index, tripled to 39,000. By 1989, the Nikkei accounted for a staggering one-third of the world’s stock market capitalization. At the time, Japanese corporates created their own form of financial engineering known as “zaitech,” which allowed them to record speculative gains as income on their balance sheets. Asset prices quickly doubled and then doubled again. At the height of the mania, the Japanese Imperial Palace was supposedly worth more than all the real estate in California. Today, U.S. corporates are heading down that same slippery slope, primarily with record share buybacks to juice their own stocks. One could argue: “True story but aren’t you just further making the bear case?” Well, not quite.

Focus: Small and mid-cap Canadian equities MARKET OUTLOOK I don’t pay much attention to the vagaries of the stock market because as a general rule the stocks I’m most interested in don’t correlate very highly with the major indexes. Turnarounds and undervalued, potentially high-growth orphan stocks generally don’t go up in a strong market or down in a weak one. Rather, they move up or down on company-specific news and activity. That said, if anything, I’d welcome a big selloff because it would allow me to deploy some of the cash I’m sitting on. TOP PICKS Fabrice Taylor, publisher of The President's Club Investment Letter, shares his top picks: goeasy; Greenpower Motor; and Colabor Group. GOEASY (GSY.TO) I’m sticking with a winner because I think there’s more room to grow. The company is funded to continue growing its primary loan book and poised to enter other lines of business. The price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is only 12 because investors view it as highly sensitive to the economy, yet unemployment fell to a 40-year low. If the company can sell less products that are less volatile to the income statement, the P/E multiple might improve and the earnings will too, giving it a turbo-charged return. Last purchased at $38 in January.  GREENPOWER MOTOR CO (GPV.TO) GreenPower manufactures electric buses ranging from small shuttles to full-size transit vehicles. There’s growing demand among cities and states, particularly in California, for electric buses and incentives for buyers. This shows up in the company's backlog, which stands at more than 200 vehicles and should be good for US$40 million of revenue in the current fiscal year and US$100 million next year. But there’s a second trend that should boost the stock. Transit authorities are getting nervous about Uber and Lyft, which are encroaching on their traditional business.

Growth in Mexico’s domestic passenger market remained steady in 1Q2019 as nearly 12 million passengers travelled on the country’s airlines. But passenger share has shifted, with ULCC Volaris leapfrogging Grupo Aeromexico as the country’s largest domestic airline measured by passengers carried. Volaris made a domestic push in the first three months of 2019 with the introduction of 16 new routes while Aeromexico unexpectedly needed to deal with the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. But even prior to the grounding, Aeromexico had planned temperate capacity growth in 2019, while its domestic ULCC competitors are on track for double digit increases.  Both airlines see continuing capacity rationalisation in the US transborder market, which should continue to help yields recover on those routes. However, Aeromexico remains cautions in its approach on US transbroder routes while Volaris continues to expand  Summary Growth in Mexico’s domestic passenger market reached nearly 6% year-on-year in 1Q2019 to 11.9 million passengers. And the passenger share shift among Mexican carriers has notably changed. Volaris captured a 32% share compared with 27% for Grupo Aeromexico. Historically FSC Aeromexico has been the dominant airline in the country, but ULCCs appear to be gaining ground. During 1Q2019 Volaris’ domestic passenger traffic increased 16.7% on 15.2% ASK growth. Ultra low cost operator Viva Aerobus posted a 13.5% increase in passengers carried year-on-year.

NTPC Limited to procure 6 million,"KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has committed itself for a 10-year period to the development and purchase of 75,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel a year. KLM is the first airline in the world to invest in sustainable aviation fuel on this scale. SkyNRG, global market leader for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), will develop Europe’s first dedicated plant for the production of SAF in Delfzijl. The production facility will specialise in producing SAF, bioLPG and naphtha, primarily using regional waste and residue streams as feedstock. The plant will be the first of its kind in the world. The construction of this facility, which is scheduled to open in 2022, is a concrete step towards fulfilling KLM’s sustainability ambitions and contributing to the broader industry plan “Smart and Sustainable”. SHV Energy, global leader in LPG distribution, will also invest in the facility and will purchase the bioLPG produced. “We are very proud to announce this project today and that we will be realising it in the Netherlands together with such strong partners,” Maarten van Dijk, executive director of SkyNRG, said. “For us and our partners, this project is an important milestone in further upscaling the market for sustainable aviation fuel. We are the first to take a step on this scale and we hope it will serve as an example to the rest of the industry in the transition towards a sustainable future for commercial aviation.”  Sustainable aviation fuel is a necessary short-term option the commercial aviation industry has, to reduce CO2 emissions in the short term, in addition to fleet renewal and operational efficiency gains. However, not enough sustainable kerosene is currently being produced. The new production plant is a SkyNRG project, called DSL-01, and will be dedicated to production of sustainable aviation fuel. From 2022, the plant will annually produce 100,000 tonnes of SAF, as well as 15,000 tonnes of bioLPG, as a by-product. It will mean a CO2 reduction of 270,000 tonnes a year for the aviation industry. This is an important step for the industry to accommodate the need for carbon emission reduction on the one hand, and the increasing demand for sustainable aviation fuel on the other. CO2 reduction of 85 per cent
The feedstocks used for production will be waste and residue streams, such as used cooking oil, coming predominantly from regional industries.

Based in the Bahamas, they have some niche services that may appeal to US traders that need more from their brokerage. SureTrader is a Bahamas-based broker/dealer regulated by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas.The draw for traders is the ability to sidestep the United States SEC pattern day trader (PDT) rules. Because of this, SureTrader continues to rake in traders who are below the $25,000 PDT level, so those with small amounts can trade as much as they want. While SureTrader seems to have troubles with customer service and several platform glitches, it still seems to depend on each individual trader as to whether these “bugs” are actually bothersome or not. If the thought of beginning day trading has new day traders mopping sweat from their brows and wiping sweat from their palms, they’ll be relieved to realize they can learn the ropes with a $100,000 free demo without incurring any losses before trying for real. The account minimums are low, allowing new day traders the flexibility to start small and get the hang of day trading. SureTrader devotes a section of its website to new day traders, and even mentions, word for word, “remember that even the most experienced traders were once newbies themselves.” Any advanced trader will recognize the value of the no pattern day trading rules and run with it, but it’s possible that once they hit the $25,000, they’ll be gone.

[+] [Updated June 10, 8:45 a.m.] United Technologies and Raytheon have agreed to merge, the companies said Sunday afternoon, crafting an all-stock deal that would create a giant evenly balanced between civil aerospace and defense that may be better positioned to handle cost pressures and uncertain prospects in both sectors. The two New England-based industrial stalwarts billed it as a “merger of equals,” but United Technologies investors would control 57% of the company, which will be called Raytheon Technologies, they said in a statement. The combined company would have almost $80 billion in annual sales in 2020, which should push it past Airbus to be the second-largest aerospace and defense player after Boeing. The aggressive move, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal Saturday evening, comes as a surprise, industry watchers told Forbes, with United Technologies already in the midst of a transformation: In November it completed a $30 billion acquisition of the aviation components supplier Rockwell Collins, and it was preparing to spin off its Otis elevators and Carrier climate controls units to become an aerospace and defense pure play. PROMOTED “Everybody knew [CEO] Greg Hayes was reorganizing United Technologies to focus on aerospace and defense, but nobody anticipated a combination of this scale,” says Loren Thompson, a defense analyst and industry consultant with the Lexington Institute. If the merger is approved by shareholders, it is expected to close in the second half of 2020 after United Technologies completes the spinoffs, which it had said would leave behind an aerospace company with $50 billion in annual revenue, roughly 75% on the commercial side, where its products run the gamut from avionics and aircraft interiors to jet engines, and 25% from defense, where its Pratt & Whitney unit has a dominant military engine franchise, making the powerplant for the F-35. The Farmington, Conn.-based company's product line has little overlap with defense stalwart Raytheon, which booked $27 billion in sales last year. Raytheon is the largest producer of missiles in the world, as well as missile defense systems like the Patriot. It also makes radars; sensors for warplanes, submarines and satellites; and electronic warfare and cybersecurity systems.
