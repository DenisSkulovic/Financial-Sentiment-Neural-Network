0,Why Shares of JetBlue Gained 15% in October | The Motley Fool,"Why Shares of JetBlue Gained 15% in October. A ""show me"" story is beginning to bear fruit.. What happened. So","   Shares of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) climbed 15.2% in October, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, fueled by the company's better-than-expected third-quarter results and aggressive 2020 guidance. The airline has been fighting pricing weakness throughout the year, but management expressed confidence it is making progress in its efforts to overhaul the company and make it more profitable. JetBlue has had an up-and-down year, with the company facing headwinds including high costs, inconsistent leisure demand, and weather issues in key markets. The company has a plan to address these challenges, including cutting annual costs by $300 million using software to better manage spare-part inventory and optimize labor hours, but the transformation is a slow process and investors have remained skeptical. IMAGE SOURCE: JETBLUE AIRWAYS. The airline's third-quarter results helped put investor worries to rest. JetBlue reported adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share, beating consensus estimates of $0.52 per share, with better cost controls. On a call with investors, CEO Robin Hayes said the results ""were driven by the compounding benefits of the structural cost program."" JetBlue also backed full-year 2020 earnings of $2.50 to $3 per share, ahead of the $2.36 analyst consensus. ""We are gaining traction on the building blocks we laid out at our last Investor Day and expect to make further progress in 2020,"" Hayes said on the call. The airline got an added bump late in the month when JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker upgraded JetBlue to overweight from neutral, noting JetBlue's valuation trails that of most airline stocks and estimating as much as 25% upside potential should the company's overhaul go as planned. JetBlue has a lot of work to do to hit its 2020 earnings goal. Most notably, the company before year's end will begin implementing a new pricing structure that management believes will help it better compete for price-sensitive travelers and drive upwards of $150 million in increased revenue. The airline also continues to tweak its schedule, replacing flights to underperforming markets with stronger ones, and continues its cost-cutting campaign. As JP Morgan's Baker noted, JetBlue today trades at barely 10 times earnings, giving the stock plenty of room to run should the transformation efforts bear fruit. JetBlue has been a ""show me"" story for investors for some time now. The airline over the next few quarters has an opportunity to show it is on the right path.

1,The Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) Share Price Is Down 11% So Some Shareholders Are Getting Worried - Simply Wall St News,The Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) Share Price Is Down 11% So Some Shareholders Are Getting Worried. What About Dividends?. A Different,"For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers So we wouldn't blame long term Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 11% over a half decade. View our latest analysis for Singapore Airlines There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement. While the share price declined over five years, Singapore Airlines actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 19% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS. Generally speaking we'd expect to see stronger share price increases on the back of sustained EPS growth, but other metrics may hold a clue to why the share price performance is relatively modest. Revenue is actually up 1.3% over the time period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity. The graphic below depicts how revenue has changed over time. Singapore Airlines is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Singapore Airlines's TSR for the last 5 years was 4.2%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return. While the broader market gained around 9.0% in the last year, Singapore Airlines","Nov 6, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/sg/transportation/sgx-c6l/singapore-airlines-shares/news/the-singapore-airlines-sgxc6l-share-price-is-down-11-so-some-shareholders-are-getting-worried

Single Air Greenland,"Welcome to flightglobal.com. This site uses cookies. Read our policy. By David Kaminski-Morrow6 November 2019 Scandinavian budget carrier Norwegian's share price has dropped by around 10% after the airline revealed it was seeking additional funding from investors, through a convertible bond issue and a release of new shares. Norwegian says the transactions leave the airline ""fully funded"" through 2020 ""and beyond"", based on its current business plan. Newly-appointed chief executive Geir Karlsen says that, while the airline is seeing results from efficiency measures, its liquidity has been hit by various factors. These include the engine issues on its Boeing 787s, the grounding of the 737 Max, and reduction in credit-card acquirer capacity. Norwegian sought the funds to provide working capital through the winter season. ""The actions we are now taking, are necessary to create financial headroom to make sure that we have sufficient liquidity as we enter the next chapter of Norwegian,"" says Karlsen. Norwegian says it has raised around NKr2.5 billion ($273 million) in gross proceeds through the private placement – comprising 27.25 million new shares, just under 20% of its share capital – combined with a $150 million convertible bond issue. Just over 5 million existing shares were also allocated during the private placement, the airline adds, sold for hedging purposes on behalf of certain investors in the convertible bond issue. It had been prepared to release up to 12.5 million of these existing shares, which are owned by HBK Holding and Folketrygdfondet. Norwegian had also included an option to increase the bond issue to $175 million. Both the private placement and the convertible bond issue received ""significant interest"" from investors, both current and new, claims Norwegian, adding that both were oversubscribed. But the market has not reacted encouragingly to the additional fundraising, with Norwegian's share price falling by around 10% following the disclosure.

Related.,Air Market Group  Aircraft leasing companies have been growing in the double digits over the last year. As sales of brand new aircraft have been slowing down in the U.S. side have slightly dropped with the grounding of the 737 MAX. This was the next flagship aircraft to be released by Boeing and was projected to have thousands of new orders in place. As airlines have been unable to grow and expand their routes due to not having the desired equipment available for order they turn to different options. The airlines do not want to invest in an older aircraft that will greatly depreciated in value over time and will result in an overall loss on the asset. Being able to lease an aircraft provides operational benefit to the airline. They are able to bring the aircraft into the fleet for the time that it is required based on the contract and then they are able to return the asset back to the owner without any financial penalty. The aircraft is paid for with operational costs which helps mitigate the risk from the airline as they are not bringing on a great deal of liability.

4,"'We kinda hate this market,' Wells Fargo's Chris Harvey says","‘We kinda hate this market,’ Wells Fargo’s Chris Harvey says as stocks trade near all-time highs. MORE IN TRADING NATION.","Wells Fargo Securities’ Christopher Harvey is looking for a signal that it’s time to take risk off the table, and he expects it’ll come sooner rather than later. The firm’s head of equity strategy is worried market sentiment is becoming too optimistic as stocks trade near all-time highs. “We kinda hate this market,” Harvey told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Wednesday. “When did we stop liking this market? It’s been relatively recent. The market has moved very close to our price target, and many of the catalysts that we talked about have played out.” Those drivers included Federal Reserve interest rate policy, better-than-expected earnings and too much bearishness among investors. Harvey’s 2019 year-end S&P 500 price target is 3,088. As of Wednesday’s close, the index is less than 1% away from that. “What we’re left with is near-term sentiment and near-term sentiment being the driver of prices,” he said. “That could be based on a tweet. It could be based on positioning. And so, it becomes very difficult to handicap this market at this point in time.” Despite his cautiousness, Harvey is not forecasting a dramatic plunge. “We don’t think the wheels are going to fall off the cart,” he said. “We don’t think we’re going to have a 10% correction.” He expects a return to a less exciting stock market environment that supports much smaller returns starting as early as next year. “I would say mid single digits for your capital market returns. And, if you have mid single digits, you should be happy,” added Harvey. “These double-digit returns that we’re used to? I think those are a thing of the past.” The S&P 500 has soared 23% so far this year while the Dow is up 18%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has performed even better over the past 52 weeks, up 27%. Harvey is in the process of determining the level he’d start taking profits. He believes the market isn’t there yet, but it’s getting closer. “Do we talk about a melt-up? Is that possible? Sure, that’s possible,” Harvey said. “As we look forward, there’s not much left for us to substantially say the market is going to move higher.” Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip?

He expects that will happen when the payment stock delivers quarterly earnings numbers after Wednesday’s market close. Based on the trading activity right now, Rosin sees Square shares moving 10% in either direction. “But we’re looking for a way to play some upside given the pressure. Upside may be a little capped,” the firm’s head of institutional equity derivatives told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “So, we’re using a call spread right now. We’re looking at the Nov. 8 $63 - $68 call spread around 1.25 here with the stock at $61.” The stock closed Tuesday at $61.06 a share, down 2.1%. Square, whose CEO is Twitter chief Jack Dorsey, has tanked 24% since Aug. 4. It’s a massive departure from the run it has had over the past three years. Over that time frame, it’s up more than 400%. “It’s getting caught in this growth sell-off right now,” said Rosin. “We’re just not seeing the demand for these names.” According to Refinitiv, Wall Street expects Square to earn 20 cents a share on $596.4 million in revenue in the third quarter. It earned 13 cents a share on $431.1 million in revenue in the period a year earlier. “Momentum selling off has affected the payment names, Square in particular,” Rosin said.

Revenues rose a paltry 2.8% year over year, highlighting growing alternatives to the company's near-monopoly, as well as competitive pricing at hotel, airlines, and car rental sites. Executives added to sell-off intensity during the conference call, lowering guidance for 2019 EBITDA growth to a new range of 5% to 8% from the previous forecast of 12% to 15%.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   PARIS (Reuters) - African swine fever (ASF) will cut pork output in China, the world's largest producer, by at least 20% in 2019, the United Nations' food agency said on Thursday, doubling the decline it had expected six months ago. The disease has slashed China's hog herd since August 2018, pushing Chinese pork prices to record highs, while reshaping global meat and feed markets. With the disease also spreading to neighboring countries, notably Vietnam, Laos, Mongolia and Cambodia, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) expects world pigmeat production to fall 8.5% this year to 110.5 million tonnes (carcass weight equivalent). In May, the FAO had forecast that Chinese pigmeat output would fall by at least 10%. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) forecast last week that African swine fever would spread further across Asia where it has devastated herds. It said no country is immune from being hit by the deadly animal virus. The fall in pork production in Asia would impact maize and oilseed use for feed, the FAO said. ""World trade in meat and meat products is forecast at 36.0 million tonnes in 2019, up 6.7% from 2018, principally driven by increased imports by China due to domestic tightness caused by ASF-related production losses,"" FAO said. China's overall meat imports are expected to rise by around 2 million tonnes, or about 35%, this year with increased purchases across all meat categories. By contrast, several countries are expected to import less meat, including the United States and Angola.

Luka Doncic capped a 27-point effort with a pair of free throws with 2:31 remaining to give the Mavericks a 107-102 lead. But Dallas didn't score again, including two missed free throws by Seth Curry with a chance to extend a 107-106 advantage with 7.0 seconds left. Orlando, which also failed to score again after a Gordon dunk with 1:09 to play, had a last-second chance to win, but Nikola Vucevic misfired on a 3-pointer, sending the Magic to their fourth consecutive defeat. Orlando had two earlier opportunities to take a late lead, but Gordon, the team's leading scorer with 23 points, was called for charging fouls with 34.7 and 7.7 seconds left. En route to just their second win in four home games this season, the Mavericks trailed by as many as 11 points in the third quarter before rallying to an 86-79 lead by period's end. But Orlando tied the game at 91, and eventually at 98 and 100 as well, before Finney-Smith's go-ahead hoop with 3:36 remaining.

Discover Thomson Reuters More By Terje Solsvik, Victoria Klesty 4 MIN READ OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air NWC.OL received a small government cash injection on Tuesday as part of the state coronavirus rescue package, and began talks with creditors complaining of missing payments amid growing worries about the carrier's liquidity. The moves came as the carrier’s founder sold more shares, the latest move over the past month to cut his stake. Norwegian, which has grounded most of its aircraft and temporarily laid off 90% of staff, amounting to about 7,300 people, had said it needed access to cash “within weeks, not months”. A condition for receiving the first 300 million Norwegian crowns ($27.50 million) from Norway’s rescue package was that commercial lenders were willing to supply 10% of that amount while the government would provide the remaining 90%. “Norwegian is pleased to announce that two Nordic banks have obtained credit committee approval to provide a guarantee for the required 10%,” a company statement said. “Norwegian will secure the necessary headroom to pursue further guarantees from the Norwegian government.” Norway said on March 19 that Norwegian Air could obtain credit guarantees worth up to 3 billion crowns to help it weather the coronavirus crisis subject to a series of conditions. Norwegian's shares rose following the announcement, up 2.1 at 1217 GMT, but were underperforming the Oslo stock index .OSEAX which was up 4.8%. On Monday, leasing company DP Aircraft DPAD.L said a unit of Norwegian Air had failed to make payments relating to two Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft in its fleet, which had been due on March 13. DP Aircraft and its asset manager, DS Aviation, will prioritize discussions with Norwegian “in order to determine whether and on what basis it may be able to meet its obligations,” DP said. On Tuesday, the airline confirmed it was in talks with leasing companies, including DP Aircraft, and other creditors to meet government requirements for the rescue package. Separately the founder of Norwegian Air and its ex-CEO, Bjoern Kjos, and former chairman, Bjoern Kise, continued to reduce the stake they jointly hold in the airline","Nov 7, 2019",https://fr.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-norwegianair/norwegian-air-gets-small-cash-infusion-starts-talks-with-creditors-idUSKBN21B0ST

18,The 25 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks for U.S. Investors | Kiplinger,Save up to 67%. The 25 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks for U.S. Investors. These 25 Canadian Dividend Aristocrats trade on,"Getty Images The U.S. is home to literally thousands of dividend payers, which would seem to eliminate the need to look elsewhere for income. But there's a convincing case to be made for at least a couple dozen Canadian dividend stocks. Newer income investors often look for the highest-yielding dividend stocks. They see a 7% yield as being better than 6%, 8% yields superior to 7%, and so on. But that's a much riskier proposition than it seems; sometimes, high yields are indicative of a troubled stock or company. A safer approach is selecting companies with more reasonable current yields that consistently grow their payouts over time. Here in America, many investors look to the Dividend Aristocrats – a group of 57 dividend stocks in the S&P 500 that have improved their annual payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. But America isn't the only part of the world with Aristocrats. Canada, for instance, has 82. The Canadian Aristocrats' standards aren't as stringent as those of their U.S. counterpart. To qualify for the Canadian Dividend Aristocrats, a stock must be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, be a member of the S&P Canada BMI (Broad Market Index), increase its annual payout for at least five consecutive years (it can maintain the same dividend for two consecutive years) and have a float-adjusted market cap of at least C$300 million. We've trimmed down that list to 25 Canadian dividend stocks that are best suited for American investors. The following 25 Canadian Dividend Aristocrats trade on either the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, and have increased their dividends annually for at least seven years. Data is as of Nov. 5. Dividend yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent payout and dividing by the share price. Analysts’ opinion from The Wall Street Journal.
