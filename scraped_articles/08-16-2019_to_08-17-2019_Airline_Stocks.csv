2,Three essential charts to understand this wild market,Three essential charts to understand this wild market. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"Stocks are capping off a wild week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 was surging more than 1% on Friday, ending a week in which it swung from massive routs to major rallies. Three charts may hold the key to understanding this market. This rebound might not be as triumphant as investors hope, according to Todd Sohn, director of technical strategy at Strategas Securities. He sees internal damage to the market that is keeping him cautious for now. “The S&P is only about [5%] off the July highs, and still in an uptrend by our work -- yet only about 40% of [stocks] on the New York Stock Exchange can say the same,” Sohn said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “There’s been significant internal deterioration here that I think the S&P 500 has done a good job masking.”  “The longer you’re sitting in this 40% area of stocks in an uptrend the more it’s going to weigh on these large-cap indices in the coming weeks,” Sohn said. However, a red-hot bond market could begin to cool down, which would trigger a rotation back into riskier assets such as equities, he reasons. The underperformance of the S&P 500 relative to bonds has reached oversold levels -- its relative strength index, a measure of momentum, fell to the year’s lows earlier this month.  “Bonds are about 18% above their 200-day moving average. That is historically extreme. So we’re in the ballpark of some sort of mean reversion pullback occurring for the Treasury bond TLT ETF,” said Sohn. The TLT ETF, which tracks long-maturity bond prices, has rallied 10% this month, its best performance since 2015. It is also trading at its highest level ever. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has declined 3%.  “Until that reversion play does occur, you stick with some of the more defensive areas – utilities, staples, REITs. I know they’re not the most fascinating plays right now but they are what’s been working as we go through all these geopolitical events,” said Sohn. The utilities, staples and real estate sectors are positive for the week, while the S&P 500 is down 1%. Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Jet Airways crisis | Jet Airways Subrata Panda  |  Mumbai 
Last Updated at August 17, 2019 01:55 IST Claims submitted by creditors against Jet Airways have shot up from Rs 24,000 crore a month ago to Rs 30,558 crore now, making hopes of any revival of the defunct airline dimmer. This comes after Etihad Airways, which holds 24 per cent in Jet, said on Monday that it did not submit an expression of interest (EoI) for the airline due to unresolved issues pertaining to its liabilities. Jet, so far, has received two EoIs, one from Panama-based Avantulo Group and the other from Russian fund Treasury RA Creator.

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Last night, Dua Lipa attended Mark Ronson’s must-see show at Catch One in Los Angeles sporting one of her trademark sexy tomboy looks. Paired with baggy, button-fly mom jeans and chunky Prada boots, the itty-bitty, red bandeau top she wore took on a cool, late ’90s vibe. And yet the real game-changer here was undoubtedly her Chanel choker, replete with interlocking Cs. In fact, the British singer is amassing quite a collection of vintage jewelry from the French house. Just two days ago, she posed on Instagram wearing a knotted white tank, a knit cardigan, faded jeans, and a glimmering Chanel necklace. This version was particularly in-your-face, with each letter of the brand spelled in sparkling diamanté. Her friend and fellow pop star Miley Cyrus has been on a similar style wavelength lately, too. A few weeks ago while performing at a festival in Kosovo, Lipa posted a video of Cyrus wearing a white tank top and a fist-sized Chanel double-C medallion necklace. In this way, they both proved that all it takes to tread the line between chic and cool is a little throwback bling. Originally Appeared on Vogue What are the fastest-growing stocks to watch in 2021?

6,Vistara net losses nearly double in FY19 to Rs 831 crore - The Financial Express,"Vistara net losses nearly double in FY19 to Rs 831 crore. Vistara’s operating revenue increased 41% year-on-year to Rs 2,994","Net losses at Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines joint venture Vistara nearly doubled to Rs 831 crore in 2018-19 on account of costlier fuel and weaker rupee. The airline had reported a net loss of Rs 419 crore in FY18 while its losses in FY17 stood at Rs 518 crore, according to the data sourced from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Vistara’s operating revenue increased 41% year-on-year to Rs 2,994 crore in 2018-19 as it carried 5.43 million passengers, up 22.6% y-o-y compared with FY18. Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) costs, on the other hand, jumped 57.6% y-o-y to Rs 1,307 crore, while aircraft lease rents and repair and maintenance costs increased 57.3% y-o-y and 42.5% y-o-y, respectively, during FY19. These costs are dollar denominated in the airlines business.  While average ATF prices during FY19 were higher 24% y-o-y, the rupee depreciated 8% y-o-y against the US dollar. The competitive pricing of tickets also added to the costs pressure, forcing all carriers to post dismal results in 2018-19. While IndiGo had reported a 93% decline in the net profit to Rs 156 crore during FY19, rival SpiceJet posted a loss of Rs 316 crore. During FY19, Vistara’s domestic market share increased to 3.9% from 3.6% in FY18. The airline’s capacity, measured in terms of available seat kilometres (ASK), grew 28.3% y-o-y in FY19. The full-service carrier started international operations earlier this month with flights to Singapore from Delhi and Mumbai. It also plans to launch services to London and Tokyo next year. Analysts expect Vistara to considerably improve its financial performance in FY20 on the back of international expansion and closure of its full-service rival Jet Airways.

7,Four tips on how to save money on IT for businesses in the UAE | Analysis – Gulf News,. . BUSINESS. . Four tips on how to save money on IT for businesses in the UAE. Deal with,"If not done right, businesses will be saddled with runaway costs and clunky software In a digitised economy, IT services occupy a growing chunk of every business’ budget. One problem that beleaguers IT managers is how to reduce their ever-growing IT costs while ensuring that the business at large does not suffer. The abundance of software solutions available for every business need serves only to intensify the problem. Which CRM (customer relationship management) is the best fit for the sales team? What email campaigning tool is most suitable for marketing? How do we integrate sales and marketing software? The answer lies in making smart choices when buying software. Here are four tips that can help you choose the right fit: The SaaS (software as a service) industry is replete with single-product companies that typically excel in just one area. If you try to integrate disparate, best-of-breed software for all your various business needs, you will be left with staggering costs and a complex web of new issues. Recognising this as a problem, vendors have started beefing up their product portfolio by either building more products or acquiring other companies and offering a pre-integrated software suite. Choosing an end-to-end solution will not only bring down your software cost, it will also allow different teams to work better together. A customer experience platform, for example, brings together CRM, marketing tools for social media, email campaigns and help desk software under one umbrella. This allows customer-facing teams to work together on improving customer experience by seamlessly sharing information with one another.
