0,Boeing 737 Max Return Will Bring Airline Fare War. Buy American Airlines Stock. | Barron's,Boeing 737 MAX’s Return Could Bring an Airline Fare War. American Airlines Stock Could Rise.. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily.,"  A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.  Airfares are likely to fall next year, after global regulators grant permission for Boeing’s 737 MAX
jet to carry passengers again. It is great news for travelers, and it isn’t necessarily bad for airlines.  Helane Becker, an analyst at the Wall Street brokerage Cowen, says prices of airline stocks already reflect fear of a surge in capacity as the jet, grounded since March following two deadly accidents within five months, re-enters service. She believes American Airlines (ticker: AAL) can rise more than 60% from recent levels despite that headwind
.  “Airline stocks continue to underperform,” noted Becker in a Wednesday research report. The group, she says, is down 12.5% so far in the third quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is off 2% over the same span. “At current levels, the stocks appear to be pricing in a potential fare war in 2020 due to atypical capacity growth from the re-entry of the 737 MAX.” The aerospace industry—including analysts, suppliers and airlines—expect the plane will be back in the skies sometime during the fourth quarter. That is based, in part, on the timeline
Boeing has disclosed, although the company is careful to point out there are no fixed dates and that the decision is up to the aviation authorities.  Boeing has stopped sending new MAX jets to customers while it tries to fix problems with the plane. Regulatory permission for the MAX to fly again would trigger a flurry of deliveries. North American airlines have about 115 MAX jets in their existing fleet of more than 6,100 planes, accounting for almost 2% of the total. Becker thinks that 82 MAX planes, or more than 70% of the current number, could be delivered in the fourth quarter based on Boeing’s timeline for the return to service. The rush of deliveries, along with capacity growth previously planned for 2020, means airlines won’t have a normal year in terms of the increase in their ability to haul passengers until 2021. “We believe 2020 capacity from the publicly traded U.S. airlines will increase 5.6% versus 3.0% in 2019,” wrote Becker. “In an environment of significant capacity growth and a waning global economy, we suspect fares will fall.” Still, Becker sees value in the sector.

1,"JetBlue rallies after an upgrade, but some experts like Delta more","JetBlue rallies after an analyst upgrade, but some experts prefer this airline stock. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC","Airline stocks have hit some turbulence. The NYSE Arca Airline Index, which tracks the group, has fallen 13% this month, weighed down by double-digit losses in shares of American Airlines, down 17% and JetBlue, off 13%. But after a bullish call on JetBlue from Deutsche Bank analysts, who flagged an “attractive entry point” emerging in shares of the travel play on Wednesday, the group turned, with JetBlue rallying over 1%. Still, some are skeptical that this marks the start of a sustained recovery for the airlines. “Overall, we’re going to stay on the runway on this one,” Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Wednesday. “Just not a lot of conviction here to own them. They rank low in our momentum work. But I will say, tactically, they are oversold, so I don’t think now is the time to bet against them, either.” The group could still be “due for ... some near-term relief,” said Wald, flagging Air Canada’s stock as his favorite overseas investment and Delta Airlines as his domestic pick. “One of the better charts in this mixed-to-weak group would be Delta,” he said.  “It’s one of the few still above its 200-day moving average,” Wald said. “This is the one I’d say we wouldn’t bet against, at least. While we’re not recommending to buy it here, I think if you do own Delta, keep an eye on that 200-day moving average right around $54 and change. If it starts to break below there, I think you have trouble, but more positive than not above that line.” Mark Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, also liked Delta’s positioning vis-a-vis the struggling sector.  “Transports in general have been on the struggle bus this year,” he said in the same “Trading Nation” interview. “But within transports, we would prefer airlines over trucking and rail, and that’s mainly because the consumer is still so strong.” With consumer confidence still high, wages on the rise and household net worth near all-time highs, consumers are still feeling financially comfortable, which benefits air travel stocks, Tepper said. Delta, he added, is best-positioned to reap those benefits. “We own Delta, and that’s definitely our favorite name here,” he said. “They’ve got zero 737 Max exposure, so what that does is it gives Delta the ability to grow their capacity while their competitors are in time-out","Aug 29, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/jetblue-rallies-after-an-upgrade-but-some-experts-like-delta-more.html
2,25 Stocks That Shine in September,25 Stocks That Shine in September. Southwest Airline stocks tends to rally in September. [Revealed] Ticker symbol of the most,"  Widely recognized investor predicted the top tech stock on the S&P 500
In the last three of four years... See his next prediction here! Sponsored It's been a rough August for U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 Index (SPX) set to close the month with a loss of more than 2%. However, ahead of the long holiday weekend -- which presents trading opportunities of its own -- we decided to hunt for stocks that could shine in September, if history is any indicator. Among the equities that tend to perform well is Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV). Below are the 25 best stocks to own in September, looking back 10 years, courtesy of Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White. LUV shares have ended the month higher 80% of the time, averaging a healthy one-month gain of 6.45% -- among the best on the list.  Since bouncing off familiar support in the $47.50-$48.50 area earlier this month, Southwest Airlines stock has rebounded roughly 8.6%. What's more, the equity is set to close atop its 200-day moving average for the first time since late July, last seen 1.9% higher at $52.12. Another 6.45% jump from current levels would put LUV around $55.48 heading into October -- near the security's July 25 post-earnings high.  LUV shares could also find some help from the options crowd. The equity's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 1.34 indicates that near-term put open interest exceeds call open interest. Further, this ratio sits higher than two-thirds of all other readings from the past year, suggesting short-term traders are more put-heavy than usual right now. Should LUV continue its trend of positive Septembers, an unwinding of pessimism among options traders could keep the wind at the stock's back. Silicon Valley's most successful angel investor reveals

3,Next hot IPO? Sun Country eyes possible opportunity | Fox Business,Next hot IPO? Sun Country eyes possible opportunity. Investors worry the airline industry may not trim capacity enough to be,"  “Bulls & Bears” panel on whether investors should be concerned about airline stocks amid empty seat concerns. A small Minnesota airline may be about to cash in big. Sun Country Airlines is considering potentially filing an IPO (initial public offering) next year, according to an interview that the CEO of the company, Jude Bricker, gave to Skift this week. Sun Country is owned by Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm in New York that has stakes in such brands as Caesar's Entertainment, Hostess and Chuck E. Cheese, which recently scrapped its plans to go public.  As for the Sun Country IPO, Bricker said there is, in his view, “a window of opportunity” for the airline right now, going on to add: “We are small and we are different.  We just want to be ready for it, if it’s open for us.  If it’s not, we’ll wait.” The last U.S. airline to go public was Nevada-based Mesa Airlines with a $116 million IPO a year ago. While the stock saw an uptick today, its share price is down more than 50% since the offering. Under Apollo’s ownership over the last 21 months, since it bought the airline in December of 2017,  Sun Country Airlines has made a variety of changes in an attempt to improve efficiency and bring down costs. The changes include everything from “moving beyond the airline’s long-time Minnesota base to start routes from other cities” such as Portland, OR and Los Angeles) to “shedding smaller and less efficient Boeing 737-700s in favor of larger Boeing 737-800s "" to dropping first class in an effort to compete with other low cost carriers like Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines, per Skift.  The results of these changes have seemingly paid off and noteworthy: “In the first quarter, Sun Country produced an operating margin excluding special items of 23.8 percent, highest among the 11 major U.S. airlines tracked by Jay Shabat, senior analyst at Skift Airline Weekly.” Additionally, according to the Star Tribune: “Last year, Sun Country reported a net income of $27 million on $616 million in revenue, according to required filings by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  That’s up from net income of $16 million on $518 million in revenue in 2016.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS And all of the above has perhaps put Sun Country","Aug 29, 2019",https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/small-minnesota-airline-exploring-ipo
4,Sun Country's owner explores taking the privately owned airline public - StarTribune.com,StarTribune. . An IPO for Sun Country? The airline's owner explores options. Iraq's central bank devalues dinar by 22% amid,"The owner of Sun Country Airlines is exploring taking the company public less than two years after it bought the Minnesota-based air carrier. Apollo Global Management — the New York-based private-equity firm that bought Sun Country in early 2018 — said it is “keeping its options open,” but declined to offer details about a potential stock offering. At a Las Vegas aviation summit Tuesday, Sun Country’s Chief Executive Jude Bricker told Skift, an online travel publication, that he has been pitching investors to gauge their interest in the small airline, a relatively unknown brand outside of Minnesota. “We are small, and we are different,” Bricker told Skift, adding that Sun Country has more work to do before it’s ready to file an initial public offering. “We just want to be ready for it, if it is open for us,” he told Skift. “If it’s not, we will wait.” Sun Country, after a request for comment, issued a statement that didn’t directly mention the IPO. “There are several options that our board of directors can take for the next step in our journey as an airline,” it said.  Bricker’s and Apollo’s investor pitch focuses on the airline’s improved efficiencies made through significant cost-cutting measures. Sun Country has undergone a rapid transformation into an ultra-low-cost carrier in the past two years, outsourcing hundreds of airport jobs, getting rid of its first-class cabin and unbundling all of its amenities so passengers only pay for what they want. Last year, Sun Country reported a net income of $27 million on $616 million in revenue, according to required filings by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. That’s up from net income of $16 million on $518 million in revenue in 2016. Bricker, a former Allegiant Air executive, was named Sun Country chief executive in 2017. Funds affiliated with Apollo bought the airline in the first quarter of 2018 from local brothers Mitch and Marty Davis, who also own Cambria, producer of natural stone countertops and surfaces. Sun Country, after nearly 40 years under different owners, has never been publicly listed. It was formed in 1983 by former Twin Cities-based pilots and flight attendants of Braniff International Airways, which closed in 1982. In the 1990s, it was owned by a Milwaukee travel agency but closed during the travel recession that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

6,JetBlue Is Tiptoeing Back Into the Cargo Business | The Motley Fool,JetBlue Is Tiptoeing Back Into the Cargo Business. A partnership with Aeronex Cargo could allow JetBlue to resume cargo service,"   A little less than four years ago, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) surprised investors by shutting down its cargo business. At the time, the company said that its cargo operation wasn't making much money and didn't fit into its future strategy. However, JetBlue is now reversing course -- or at least considering it. On Monday, the airline announced that it will partner with Aeronex Cargo to resume cargo service on certain routes in the years ahead. Aeronex Cargo will do most of the behind-the-scenes work necessary to make JetBlue's new cargo service work. This will limit the carrier's need to invest money and crew-member time in building up a cargo operation. JetBlue will start by offering cargo service in Fort Lauderdale. Initially, Aeronex will arrange for cargo originating in Fort Lauderdale or arriving there on other passenger and freight airlines to be sent on JetBlue flights to selected destinations in the airline's route network. Later on, Aeronex will begin transferring cargo from Miami International Airport -- an airport with far more cargo traffic -- to Fort Lauderdale for onward transport by JetBlue. By the end of 2019, JetBlue will launch cargo service in partnership with Aeronex at three more key bases: Boston, Los Angeles, and New York's JFK Airport. Within five years, JetBlue hopes to offer cargo service between 30 of the more than 100 airports in its route network. JETBLUE HOPES TO OFFER CARGO SERVICE AT UP TO 30 AIRPORTS BY 2024. IMAGE SOURCE: JETBLUE AIRWAYS. JetBlue's about-face on cargo might seem odd but can probably be traced to changes in the airline's fleet. Back in late 2015, when the company decided to shut down its cargo operation, management noted that JetBlue had limited cargo capacity due to the nature of the aircraft it operated. At the time, its fleet consisted of 130 Airbus (OTC:EADSY) A320s, 21 A321s, and 60 Embraer E190s. The E190s are 100-seat planes with little or no room for cargo. Meanwhile, JetBlue's workhorse Airbus A320s have limited space for cargo after accounting for passenger bags. JetBlue's project to add 12 extra seats to each A320 will make that worse -- a factor that contributed to the 2015 decision to exit the cargo market. Additionally, on longer flights (such as transcontinental routes), the A320 is often unable to carry cargo due to weight limits. However, by the end of 2018, JetBlue had tripled the size","Aug 28, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/28/jetblue-is-tiptoeing-back-into-the-cargo-business.aspx

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders? Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for JetBlue Airways As you can see below, JetBlue Airways had US$1.39b of debt, at June 2019, which is about the same the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$909.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$484.0m. Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that JetBlue Airways had liabilities of US$2.89b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$3.65b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$909.0m as well as receivables valued at US$282.0m due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$5.35b. Given this deficit is actually higher than the company's market capitalization of US$4.96b, we think shareholders really should watch JetBlue Airways's debt levels, like a parent watching their child ride a bike for the first time. Hypothetically, extremely heavy dilution would be required if the company were forced to pay down its liabilities by raising capital at the current share price.       Sometimes, following a leader makes the best investment strategy. And corporate insiders have long been popular leaders",14 hours ago,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-jetblue-airways-nasdaq-113842689.html
8,Profiting From Trash: 3 Waste Management Stocks to Consider,Profiting From Trash: 3 Waste Management Stocks to Consider. Market expected to grow at 6% annually between 2018 and 2025.,"Don't let bears trash talk the stock market amid its recent challenges. In fact, ""trash"" might be the perfect place to scan for opportunities as volatility persists. Waste management stocks look set to benefit as the world's population continues to increase and become more urbanized. Allied Market Research projects the global waste management market to register a 6% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2025 to reach $530 billion. Combine this with reduced locations to dump garbage along with innovative new technologies that enhance collection and recycling solutions, and the not so glamorous industry suddenly looks appealing as a defensive play. Stifel analyst Michael Hoffman recently pointed out in a research report cited by Barron's that the waste management business is capital intensive, highly regulated, provides an essential service, generates ample cash flow, and has the potential for small, tuck-in acquisitions that enhance existing networks. Furthermore, 80% of sales are service-based, reducing the industry's dependence on the economy's overall health to offer a level of protection against a possible recession. Hoffman also believes that pricing and recycling-contract improvement add additional tailwinds to the space. ""Solid waste [players are] on pace in [2019] to produce reported price [gains] of 2.5% to 5%,"" the Stifel analyst said. ""[Network] density and asset utilization help support price power,"" wrote Hoffman. Although the waste removal services segment trades at a premium to the S&P 500 from a forward earnings perspective – about 27 times compared to 18 times – these three industry players should continue to thrive for the characteristics outlined above. Let's take a more detailed look at each stock and rummage for some possible trades. Waste Management, Inc. (WM) provides waste management services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers in North America. The Houston, Texas-based company announced in April that it had agreed to acquire Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (ADSW) for about $3 billion to expand it presence in the eastern United States. Waste Management reported second quarter (Q2) earnings per share (EPS) of $1.11, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $1.07 per share. Revenue also came in better than expected, increasing 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. Management credited healthy yield and volume growth in the company's collection and disposal business for its strong top-line performance. The upbeat financial results mark the fourth consecutive quarter that the garbage giant has topped analysts' earnings projections.

It will discuss co-investment options with its lenders and infrastructure companies, the group’s advisor told Business Standard.

Send Us Your Comments:. See also:. HIGHLIGHT. E-PAPER. . . .,"  HÀ NỘI – Budget airline Vietjet (VJC) has repurchased 17.77 million shares of the company on the stock market, equivalent to nearly 3.3 per cent of the airline’s charter capital, the company said. This number of shares was lower than its initial buyback plan of 25 million shares. The average buying price was VNĐ132,062 (US$5.67)  per share which meant the airline spent nearly VNĐ2.35 trillion (roughly $101 million) on the buyback. In its filing to the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange on Wednesday, the company attributed the reason for not buying the number of registered shares to inadequate liquidity in the market. After the purchase, outstanding Vietjet shares decreased from 541.6 million to 532.84 million. According to market analysis, the current price of Vietjet’s shares is at a good range for the company to invest. Many securities companies have reckoned Vietjet’s shares would be included in the portfolios of the two exchange-traded funds – FTSE Vietnam UCITS ETF and VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF – in their last quarter restructuring this week. Shares of the company dropped 0.3 per cent on Thursday to VNĐ132,000 a share. In the first half of this year, the airline reported an increase of nearly 24 per cent in total revenue to VNĐ23.6 trillion and 4.3 per cent rise in net profit of VNĐ2.08 trillion.

HTTPS://TWITTER.COM/MITCHELLAIRPORT Midwest Express Airlines Inc. Milwaukee, WI See full profile General Mitchell International Airport Milwaukee, WI See full profile Midwest Express Airlines is back in Milwaukee and so are the signature baked in-flight chocolate chip cookies. Midwest Express president Greg Aretakis announced Wednesday at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport the initial departures for the Milwaukee-based airline making its return after nearly a decade hiatus from the skies. Beginning at the end of the year, Midwest Express will offer nonstop flights to Grand Rapids, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska; and Cincinnati. “We’re here to celebrate the next milestone with the return of Midwest Express back to Milwaukee,” Milwaukee airport director Brian Dranzik said to a round of applause at the morning press conference. Earlier this month, Midwest Express announced its agreement with Portland, Maine-based Elite Airways LLC, which will supply the flight operations, including the aircraft for Midwest Express. Midwest Express unveiled the new Elite Airways-operated Bombardier CRJ 200 at the Wednesday press conference. The plane had a new look compared with the signature blue, red and yellow Midwest planes. The 50-seat aircraft featured yellow and blue trim on white with the initials ME on the tail and Midwest Express along the side of the aircraft. Midwest Express Airlines filed a private stock offering in May 2018 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with the intent to resurrect the popular hometown airline. Midwest Express changed its name to Midwest Airlines in 2004 and later merged with Frontier Airlines in 2010. “Midwest was always a partnership between the city of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee business community and this airport and the service that we provide. It was for many years. It’s been gone for many years and once again the partnership is coming back,” Aretakis said. Former Midwest Express customers will be pleased to return to the comfortable two-by-two leather seating on the aircraft. The Midwest Express-branded jets touched down at Mitchell International Airport Wednesday.  But the signature large leather seats were not the primary thing that former customers wanted, Aretakis said. “Everyone was asking for convenience,” Aretakis said. “The great customer service that Midwest was famous for was the second thing.” Elite Airways president John Pearsall said the partnership with Midwest Express worked because Elite Airways, which operates on the East Coast, is focused on high","Aug 28, 2019",https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2019/08/28/midwest-express-begins-long-awaited-comeback-with.html

By: Francois Aure | Email | Leave a comment It appears that stock market investors might not be the only ones feeling the heat from the US-China trade war. In a bombshell leak from Donald Trump’s private aides, CNN confirms the rumor that President Trump lied about the phone call with China to pump flailing US stocks. CNN reports (emphasis added): “Though Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted there had been “communication,” aides privately conceded the phone calls Trump described didn’t happen they way he said they did. Instead, two officials said Trump was eager to project optimism that might boost markets, and conflated comments from China’s vice premier with direct communication from the Chinese.” For many traders, this revelation won’t come as much of a surprise. Prominent fund manager and TV host Jim Cramer made it clear that he believes it doesn’t matter that Trump lied because it signals something much more important: that he might be softening on China. Trump now admits that he made up the late night phone call from China so as to manipulate the stock market higher. Private citizens have actually been prosecuted for doing that for personal financial gain. I guess it's OK for a president to do it for personal political gain. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) August 29, 2019  Trump has used the stock market as a clear barometer of his trade policy and has stepped in on multiple occasions when sell-offs have been getting out of hand.

17,End of days? Jet Airways to vacate headquarters in 45 days - The Financial Express,End of days? Jet Airways to vacate headquarters in 45 days. Luckystar had moved the tribunal in last month seeking,"Jet Airways will vacate Siroya Centre, the premises where it is currently headquartered in Mumbai, in the next 45 days. The legal counsels of the resolution professional (RP) for the defunct airline and Luckystar, the owner of the property, informed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the parties are very close to reaching a settlement on the matter. The RP also sought more time from the tribunal to present a final list of resolution applicants for the airline. Luckystar had moved the tribunal in last month seeking to remove the airline’s headquarters from the disputed premises as Jet’s lease had expired on June 7. The committee of creditors (CoC), in its meeting earlier this week, has broadly agreed to the settlement terms put forth by Luckystar. Also read| Trade financing: How Credit Guarantee Fund for factoring may solve liquidity crunch for MSMEs The RP informed the tribunal that the deadline has been extended for submission of expressions of interest for Jet Airways, adding that two parties so far have been provisionally short listed as eligible resolution applicants. Earlier this week, the CoC decided to extend the EoI submission deadline to August 31 to allow some time to South American Synergy Group, the owner of Avianca Airlines. The Synergy Group had evinced interest in the airline last week, after the initial deadline to submit EoIs had already passed on August 10. Russian fund Treasury RA Creator is the other entity that has been provisionally shortlisted.
The Synergy Group has been in ongoing discussions with the RP regarding the defunct airline. The RP also sought additional time from the court to present the final list of eligible resolution applicants. The RP will now submit the next progress report on the resolution of Jet Airways on September 20. A two-member bench at NCLT Mumbai admitted Jet Airways for insolvency on June 20. While passing the oral order, Judge VP Singh called the resolution of the airline a matter of “national importance” and urged the RP to complete the process within 90 days. The airline was grounded on April 17 after lenders refused to provide emergency funding to continue operations. Slots belonging to Jet Airways have since been allotted to other airlines.
