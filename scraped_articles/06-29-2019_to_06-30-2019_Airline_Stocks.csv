5,Does American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet? - Simply Wall St News,Does American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?. When Is Debt A Problem?. What Is American Airlines Group's,"Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card! The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating? Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for American Airlines Group As you can see below, American Airlines Group had US$24.0b of debt, at March 2019, which is about the same the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$4.35b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$19.7b. According to the last reported balance sheet, American Airlines Group had liabilities of US$19.8b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$41.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$4.35b as well as receivables valued at US$1.88b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$55.2b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined. The deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$14.5b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt At the end of","Jun 30, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-aal/american-airlines-group/news/does-american-airlines-group-nasdaqaal-have-a-healthy-balance-sheet
6,Delta Air Lines' Oil Refinery Just Became Way More Valuable | The Motley Fool,Delta Air Lines' Oil Refinery Just Became Way More Valuable. The closure of the largest refinery on the East Coast,"   Philadelphia Energy Solutions' refinery suffered a massive explosion and fire in the early morning of June 21. (Fortunately, there were only a handful of minor injuries.) Last week, the company -- which filed for bankruptcy last year and has continued to face financial difficulties -- announced that it will not repair and reopen the South Philadelphia facility. This marks a sudden end for the largest oil refinery in the Northeast. But it's good news for Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which owns one of the few remaining refineries in the region. (Several others have closed over the past decade.) While other airlines could face higher jet fuel prices due to the loss of refinery capacity, Delta's Monroe Energy subsidiary could see a nice uptick in profits from higher refining margins. Seven years ago, Delta shocked observers by buying a refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, that had recently been shuttered by Phillips 66. Delta's total investment was around $250 million: $150 million after government incentives to buy the refinery, plus $100 million for upgrades. Many pundits doubted that an airline could successfully operate a refinery that struggled as part of a major refining company. However, Delta's management saw the deal as a cheap, relatively low-risk way to protect itself against swings in refining margins that can drive up the price of jet fuel at times. DELTA BOUGHT A REFINERY IN 2012 TO HEDGE AGAINST VOLATILE REFINING MARGINS. IMAGE SOURCE: DELTA AIR LINES. The Trainer refinery has had a mixed track record under Delta's ownership. Changes in the structure of the oil market and rising environmental compliance costs have made the refinery less profitable than the airline had projected. (Back in 2012, Delta said the refinery would earn $300 million annually. It nearly hit that figure in 2015, but hasn't come close since.) On the other hand, owning the refinery has insulated Delta from elevated refining margins during periods of disruption, such as after Hurricane Harvey in late 2017. The refinery posted operating income of $110 million in 2017 and $58 million in 2018, before swinging to a $34 million loss in the first quarter of 2019. East Coast refining margins jumped by several cents following the explosion at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery. While there is plenty of infrastructure to move more refined products to the Northeast by pipeline and ship, the uptick in refining margins in the region is","Jun 29, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/29/delta-air-lines-oil-refinery-just-became-way-more.aspx

8,Airlines Reimagining Core Operations With Blockchain - CIO Journal - WSJ,. . More Deloitte Insights Articles. . Airlines Reimagining Core Operations With Blockchain. . *****. Related Content. . Editor's Choice.,"  Investment in blockchain is increasing across business sectors, thanks to compelling use cases and cautious optimism about the technology’s traction. Airlines, too, are exploring practical blockchain applications to reinvent everything from loyalty programs to the supply chain. The buzz around blockchain has continued unabated since proponents began touting the emerging distributed ledger technology over a decade ago. What has changed, however, is blockchain’s evolution from an undeveloped, unproven solution to a more refined and mature opportunity that can deliver true digital transformation. According to Deloitte’s 2019 Blockchain Survey, 40% of respondents say they are willing to spend $5 million or more on new blockchain initiatives over the next 12 months. At the same time, 53% say blockchain technology has become a critical priority for their organizations in 2019—a 10-point increase over last year. The airline industry is increasingly exploring the potential of blockchain to reinvent its core operations and ecosystems, including loyalty programs, parts tracking, and other parts of the supply chain. A recent Deloitte Dbriefs webcast on the topic examined how airlines can use blockchain, with an in-depth look at practical industry applications and key steps airlines can take to evaluate potential opportunities. Blockchain Part of a Suite of Airline Industry Disruptors Several digital tools are already disrupting the airline industry, each with significant potential to boost business efficiencies. These include applying machine-learning-based cognitive computing, scaling services and reducing costs through cloud computing, and introducing advanced analytics capabilities that foster nimble decision-making. Airlines are now poised to add blockchain to this transformation mix. They can implement blockchain platforms in concert with other digital technologies to create more efficient, agile processes. Simply defined, blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a way for a community to record, share, and maintain information. Trusted participants with permission all have access to the same data, while changes cannot be made to what is already written to the ledger. That means blockchain offers a single source of truth among participants at all times. Airlines will likely not use blockchain as a replacement for existing technical architecture but as a technology overlay that connects trading partners in various systems, such as ERP, order management, or billing. Airlines can use blockchain to improve processes between partners in several areas. These include record keeping, as records on a blockchain are secure, immutable, and accessible only to trusted participants; value transfer, with transactions occurring automatically in","Jun 30, 2019",https://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2019/06/30/airlines-reimagining-core-operations-with-blockchain/

10,How Companies Use Derivatives to Hedge Risk,How Companies Use Derivatives to Hedge Risk. . KEY TAKEAWAYS. Foreign Exchange Risks. Hedging Interest Rate Risk. Commodity or Product,"If you are considering a stock investment and read the company uses derivatives to hedge some risk, should you be concerned or reassured? Warren Buffett's stand is famous: He has attacked all derivatives, saying he and his company ""view them as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system ... derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.""1﻿ On the other hand, the trading volume of derivatives has escalated rapidly, and non-financial companies continue to purchase and trade them in ever-greater numbers.2 To help you evaluate a company's use of derivatives for hedging risk, we'll look at the three most common ways to use derivatives for hedging. One of the more common corporate uses of derivatives is for hedging foreign currency risk, or foreign exchange risk, which is the risk a change in currency exchange rates will adversely impact business results. Let's consider an example of foreign currency risk with ACME Corporation, a hypothetical U.S.-based company that sells widgets in Germany. During the year, ACME Corp sells 100 widgets, each priced at 10 euros. Therefore, our constant assumption is that ACME sells 1,000 euros worth of widgets. When the dollar-per-euro exchange rate increases from $1.33 to $1.50 to $1.75, it takes more dollars to buy one euro, meaning the dollar is depreciating or weakening. As the dollar depreciates, the same number of widgets sold translates into greater sales in dollar terms. This demonstrates how a weakening dollar is not all bad: It can boost export sales of U.S. companies. (Alternatively, ACME could reduce its prices abroad, which, because of the depreciating dollar, would not hurt dollar sales; this is another approach available to a U.S. exporter when the dollar is depreciating.) The above example illustrates the ""good news"" event that can occur when the dollar depreciates, but a ""bad news"" event happens if the dollar appreciates and export sales end up being less. In the above example, we made a couple of very important simplifying assumptions that affect whether the dollar depreciation is a good or bad event: Even after natural hedges and secondary effects, most multinational corporations are exposed to some form of foreign currency risk. Now let's illustrate a simple hedge a company like ACME might use. To minimize the effects of any USD/EUR exchange rates, ACME purchases 800 foreign exchange futures contracts against","Jun 29, 2019",https://www.investopedia.com/trading/using-derivatives-to-hedge-risk/
11,Analyzing Porter's Five Forces on Apple (AAPL),Analyzing Porter's Five Forces on Apple (AAPL). . KEY TAKEAWAYS. The Porter Five Forces Model. . Apple in the Marketplace,"Investors and market analysts often seek different perspectives for market analyses of companies to gain a better picture of companies' positions and strengths within their particular industries. One tool for fundamental analysis that goes beyond just examining financial metrics such as the price-to-book ratio (P/B) is Michael Porter's Five Forces Model. Michael Porter developed the Five Forces method of analysis in 1979.1﻿ The Five Forces model aims to examine five key forces of competition within a given industry. The main force examined by Porter's model is the level of competition within an industry. A person could even argue that Porter's model is essentially an analysis of the competitiveness or non-competitiveness of an industry. The other four forces considered in Porter's model all impact the level of competition. They include the threat of new entrants to the marketplace, the threat of consumers opting for substitute products, the bargaining power of suppliers within the industry, and the bargaining power of buyers or consumers within the industry's marketplace. Industry competition and the bargaining power of buyers are the most substantial marketplace factors that impact Apple in terms of profitability. Through its Macintosh computers and operating system, the iPad, iPhone, and other products, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has achieved massive success as a company despite going through a number of up and down cycles since its founding in 1976.2﻿ In 2018, Apple achieved the notable distinction of being the first U.S. company to ever attain a market capitalization greater than $1 trillion.3﻿ Apple's success is attributed largely to its ability to innovate and bring unique products to market that have engendered substantial brand loyalty.4﻿ Its product development and marketing strategies reveal an awareness of the need to deal with the major marketplace forces that can impact Apple's market share and profitability. A Five Forces analysis of Apple's position in the technology sector shows industry competition and the bargaining power of buyers as the two strongest marketplace forces that can impact Apple's profitability. The bargaining power of suppliers, the threat of buyers opting for substitute products, and the threat of new entrants to the marketplace are all weaker elements among the key industry forces. Apple's dominance in the industry has been largely unchallenged, but a strong challenger could come in the future and the company must continue innovating and building brand loyalty so as to keep any potential competitor at bay.

Last Updated at June 29, 2019 23:24 IST The closure of Jet Airways and terror attacks in Colombo led to double digit drop in duty free sales at airports in India and Sri Lanka, said Manishi Sanwal, chief executive officer of Flemingo Travel Retail on Thursday. Flemingo group, which runs duty free stores at twelve airports in India and a few other countries, however, expects business to recover by end of current fiscal with the opening of new outlets and aggressive marketing. The Indian subcontinent contributed 40 per cent to its consolidated revenue of around $750 million (Rs 5,250 crore) in FY 2019. ""April was the worst month for us. There has been an impact on our business and we are trying to mitigate it by opening new stores and focusing on marketing and promotions to drive sales. We don't know yet what will be the full year impact of Jet Airways grounding on our sales but we expect a recovery. Traffic growth should normalise by next March,"" Sanwal said. Jet Airways shut down operations on April 17. The airline suspended all international fights a week earlier. Jet was the largest airline on overseas routes from India and also the biggest airline operating in Mumbai. For Flemingo, the airline's grounding had a major impact as its store in Mumbai contributes significantly to its topline. Flemingo group also supplied products to Jet Airways for its on board duty free sales. The April 21 terror attacks in Colombo added to the travel retailer's woes as tourists cancelled or deferred travel to Sri Lanka. International traffic at Mumbai airport dropped 12 per cent in April, according to Airport Authority of India data. Flemingo's business at Mumbai witnessed single digit decline that month. Typically, around 8-9 per cent of all flyers shop at its Mumbai store and in April the percentage increased to around 12 per cent and thus limiting the impact of Jet's grounding. Sanwal pointed out that the grounding resulted in shorter queues at airport security and immigration, thereby giving passengers more time at the terminal.

16,Calendar effect - Wikipedia,Calendar effect. Contents. Causes[edit]. Examples[edit]. Arguments that calendar effects do not exist or are not significant[edit]. References[edit]. External links[edit]. .,"A calendar effect (or calendar anomaly) is any market anomaly, different behaviour of stock markets, or economic effect which appears to be related to the calendar, such as the day of the week, time of the month, time of the year, time within the U.S. presidential cycle, decade within the century, etc...[1] Some people believe that if they do exist, it is possible to use market timing to profit from calendar effects. Seasonal patterns are not confined to prices; many other systems can exhibit the same kind of calendar effect. However, the term is most often used in an economic context. Market prices are often subject to seasonal tendencies because the availability and demand for an item is not constant throughout the year. For example, natural gas prices often rise in the winter because that commodity is in demand as a heating fuel. In the summer, when the demand for heat is lower, prices typically fall. Notable calendar effects include: In their 2001 paper Dangers of data mining: The case of calendar effects in stock returns, Ryan Sullivan et al. argue that there is no statistically significant evidence for calendar effects in the stock market, and that all such patterns are the result of data dredging.[2] However there are contradictory findings and there is an ongoing debate on behavioral economics versus rational choice theory. According to the efficient-market hypothesis, the calendar anomalies should not exist because the existence of these anomalies should be already incorporated in the prices of securities.[3] According to Vasileiou, calendar anomalies are significantly influenced by the financial trend, because the investors' psychology depends on the business cycle, and their behavioral change influences not only the market's performance but also the calendar anomalies.[4] According to Vasileiou, calendar anomalies exist but if we examine them using the usually applied definitions, this effect seems to fade.[5]","Jun 29, 2019",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_effect
17,Fresh Hopes of Survival for Jet Airways as Hinduja-Etihad Look Set to Join the List of Bidders,BUSINESS. Fresh Hopes of Survival for Jet Airways as Hinduja-Etihad Look Set to Join the List of Bidders. The report,"Image used for representation purpose. Revival hopes for Jet Airways (India) Ltd took flight once again as Moneycontrol reported late on Friday that a consortium of Hinduja Group and Etihad Airways is likely to re-enter the race to acquire stake in the bankrupt airline. The process will take place through the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Hinduja Group and Etihad Airways are set to bid together for Jet Airways under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), four independent sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol. The report added that the Tata Group is also exploring the possibility of a potential bid, but hasn’t taken a final decision yet. Qatar Airways is also in exploratory mode and may join the fray if it finds a suitable domestic partner, the sources said. Earlier in the day, Jet Airways employees and London-based investor Adi Partners LLP said they will jointly bid for a 75% stake in the debt-laden airline. AdiGro Aviation founder Sanjay Viswanathan said his firm will take 49% and the rest will be with the employees’ consortium since there is a 49% cap on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the aviation sector. Bidders are usually keen on stressed assets under the IBC as it has several advantages as compared to a stake-purchase situation outside the code. “An IBC process offers several advantages to a bidder. First, you do not need to individually negotiate with each stakeholder as an approved resolution plan is binding on all stakeholders. Second, you can whitewash all unknown past liabilities through the plan. Third, you can restructure the existing equity faster. Finally, de-listing a company under IBC is a much easier process,” said Sudip Mahapatra, Partner at law firm S&R Associates. After failing to find any buyer for the airline, SBI on 18 June filed an insolvency petition against Jet Airways in NCLT under Section 7 of IBC.
