BTC-USD.,"                                                   The airline industry has been the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in social distancing and disrupted air travel. The trend seems to be reversing lately with easing of restrictions, reopening of the economy and new safety measures that have led to the resumption of flights in many countries.

This is especially true as U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, the one ETF dedicated to the airline industry, was the best performer over the past week, having gained nearly 17%. Here are some insights into the solid performance (read: Does Warren Buffett's Latest Move Spell Doom for Airline ETF?).

Memorial Day Travel Ticks Up

Air travel bumped up over the Memorial Day weekend to levels not seen since plummeting in March when stay-home orders took effect across most of the United States. More than 1.5 million passengers passed through airport security checkpoints during the Memorial Day weekend. Though this is just a fraction of 12.2 million people who flew during the same period in 2019, it is the strongest number since late March and indicates a solid revival in airline business from the lows seen in mid-April.

In particular, the Memorial Day weekend was the busiest travel period for American Airlines AAL since Mar 21. The carrier said that the traffic was 320% better during May 22 through May 25 than April 10-13, when it saw the worst of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines LUV is expecting improved business in May and June.

European Comeback

Some European countries are easing travel restrictions. Italy plans to allow travel between select European countries starting Jun 3. Germany and Greece plan to resume flights on Jun 15, while Spain will lift the mandatory two-week quarantine for overseas travelers starting Jul 1.

Summer Travel Optimism

Airlines in many parts of the world are planning to resume flights starting next month. Air China is expected to operate 24 international routes between Jun 1 and Jul 1 while Air France is planning to increase its flight schedules during June. Alitalia has announced plans to ramp up services next month, including the resumption of its nonstop Rome-New York routes from Jun 2.

4,Why Shares of Airlines Are Falling Today | The Motley Fool,Why Shares of Airlines Are Falling Today. There is no quick turnaround in sight.. What happened. So what. Now what.,"   After a brief rally earlier in the week on hopes of an improving economy, airline shares are in the red once again on Thursday. Some of the nation's largest airlines are proceeding with plans to try to cut their headcount, a clear indication that despite glimmers of hope the worst is behind us, management teams still expect a long, rough road ahead. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) were down 6.6% as of 2:30 p.m. EDT and shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) were down 4.4%. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which earlier in the day was down 5.2%, had recovered some of that loss, but were still down on a day when broader markets are up. Airline shares have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced travel demand to a trickle and caused carriers that a few months ago were focused on expansion to instead worry about their survival. The companies are stable, in part thanks to $50 billion in government assistance for the industry as part of the CARES Act stimulus plan, but that stability has come with a price. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. As part of the terms of the stimulus funding, airlines are prohibited from doing any layoffs or involuntary separations through Sept. 30. Lawmakers were hopeful that if the travel slump was temporary, large numbers of layoffs could be avoided. As we head into June, airlines seem increasingly skeptical about a quick recovery. United Airlines has been blunt in forecasting reductions since March, warning that furloughs were inevitable even as they were accepting bailout cash. Delta and American are also looking to shrink. American is seeking to cut more about 30% of total managerial and administrative support positions, or about 5,000 jobs, initially via voluntary buyouts but through layoffs if necessary. The airline said employees will remain on the payroll until Sept. 30, 2020, as required by the CARES Act, but will be dismissed after that date. Meanwhile, in a memo to employees, Delta outlined its own buyout package, offering four to 20 weeks of severance, a year of paid medical coverage, and travel benefits. Those who qualify for early retirement would get up to 26 weeks of severance and two years of medical coverage. The message is clear: No matter what happens with the pandemic and the economy, the airlines expect to be considerably smaller in the years to","May 28, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/28/why-shares-of-airlines-are-falling-today.aspx
5,Why Did Warren Buffett Sell His Airline Stocks? - Financhill,Menu. Why Did Warren Buffett Sell His Airline Stocks?. 1. Airlines Balance Sheets Are Frightening. 2. New Government Debt Hurts,"Why Did Warren Buffett Sell His Airline Stocks? Warren Buffett is used to making headlines with his investments, but he got everyone abuzz when Berkshire Hathaway wiped its hands clean of the airline sector in the beginning of May 2020. He announced his decision during the company’s annual call, and it turned heads because airlines were among the investments assumed to be future proof, especially the way he did it. The company doesn’t just own shares in one airline – the Oracle of Omaha always diversifies his investments, so he held a stake in all four major airlines in the U.S., which are: ·       American Airlines (AAL) ·       United Airlines (UAL) ·       Delta Airlines (DAL) ·       Southwest Airlines (LUV) These four airlines account for 80% of all U.S. air traffic, and Berkshire Hathaway was quick to enter into a 10% ownership position on each before the global pandemic ramped up in the start of 2020.  When airline stocks dropped in February, Buffett at first saw this as a time to shore up his investments for a discount. However, the Trump administration’s $25 billion airline bailout, combined with global shutdowns, turned this reality into a pipe dream. Instead of remaining stable, the stocks further dropped, signaling investor uncertainty in several key areas necessary for recovery. What was once a surefire bet may now go the way of Pan Am or TWA. So, why did Warren Buffett sell his airline stocks? There are likely four key ingredients to his reasoning. Running an airline is expensive, so it’s no wonder there’s an incoming onslaught of bankruptcies. None of these businesses were prepared for the financial impact of the global shutdowns. Airlines take on lots of debt to finance purchases of planes and other necessary equipment, giving them hefty bills to eat away at revenues and profits. This pushes them to run on tight margins, so they’re always spending cash towards operations as fast as they earn it to keep things afloat. This puts these companies in a precarious position during the global civic lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Revenue declines of 80% crush these businesses, quickly evaporating cash levels, destroying profits, and forcing them to close in a hurry. They simply aren’t prepared to weather the","May 28, 2020",https://financhill.com/blog/investing/why-did-warren-buffett-sell-his-airline-stocks

irline stocks are currently a risky investment, despite their low prices. Could the obscure US Global Jets ETF [JETS] be a safer and better long-term opportunity? With planes grounded due to cross-border travel restrictions and passengers reluctant to travel cross-country by air, airline stocks have nosedived during the Covid-19 pandemic. Delta Airlines’ [DAL] share price closed at $26.25 on 26 May. Although this was 36.7% above a low of $19.19 achieved last week — its lowest point in more than six years — Delta Airlines’ share price is still 57% below its 52-week high of $62.26 set last July. Meanwhile, United Airline’s [UAL] share price closed at $30.50 on 26 May, 43.9% above mid-March low of $21.2 — its lowest point since 2013 — but 67.9% down from a 52-week high of $95.28, also set last July.  43.9% UNITED AIRLINE'S SHARE PRICE RISE BETWEEN MID-MARCH AND 26 MAY Other major operators, including American Airlines [AAL] and Southwest Airlines [LUV], have seen their share prices follow a similar trajectory, as previously flattened airline stocks have staged a small recovery on hope of easing lockdowns globally. But has the Jets ETF experienced a similar trajectory? The US Global Jets ETF has seen an influx of investor interest, despite its share price hitting turbulence in the past few months.   Buffett rebuffs airlines At the start of the month, Warren Buffett revealed at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting (held virtually) that he had sold his holdings in the aforementioned four major airlines in April. According to the Financial Times Buffett had sold $6bn of stock in April related to airlines but no details were given.  $6BILLION VALUATION OF AIRLINE-RELATED STOCKS SOLD BY WARREN BUFFETT IN APRIL Buffett said the airline business had","May 28, 2020",https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-gb/opto/airline-stocks-dive-but-the-jets-etf-gets-wind-under-its-wings
7,Southwest Is a Much Better Pick Now Than AAL Stock | InvestorPlace,Southwest Is a Much Better Pick Now Than American Airlines Stock. American's huge debt pile makes it one of the," The last few weeks have been big for airline stocks. Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) gave the industry a glimmer of hope with a novel coronavirus vaccine update. States continue to reopen, and travel demand is on the rise. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock has been a big beneficiary.  While a vaccine would be a Hail Mary pass for beleaguered airlines, I wouldn’t necessarily rush out to pick up AAL stock. Why? Even if a vaccine comes out next autumn — and that would be an absolute best-case scenario — airlines will struggle to recover over the next few quarters. American Airlines simply isn’t well equipped to get through that struggle, making it a poor choice to play the rally in airline stocks. From an investment standpoint, American Airlines’ biggest problem right now is debt. The firm is sitting on a $21.6 billion debt pile — high by any standard. AAL stock is easily one of the most debt-ridden airline names you can pick up right now. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is the only other airline that comes close with long-term debt obligations of $13.2 billion. By contrast, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is carrying just $2.3 billion worth of long-term debt.  Understandably, American is burning through cash right now as it works to stay afloat amid extremely challenging conditions. But that’s going to add up to a huge debt pile that will follow the firm around for quite some time.  InvestorPlace’s Mark Hake estimates the firm will be sitting under a $40 billion debt obligation by the end of the year. That’s disastrous from an investment standpoint because it means the company will be shelling out billions each year just to pay off the interest. Some might argue that the prospect of a vaccine could bring a faster-than-expected recovery in the transport sector as it means borders would be open and people could move about freely. That may be true, but that scenario is unlikely to play out. Even if we could be certain a vaccine was coming, there’s no way to predict how readily it would be accepted by Americans, let alone the rest of the world. Here’s a new drug that’s been pushed through the testing process as quickly as possible — will people trust it? There’s already been some pushback regarding a mandatory vaccination and a drug hasn’t even been approved yet. Plus, there’s the added impact of the","May 29, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/05/buy-southwest-instead-of-aal-stock-coronavirus-airlines/

10,Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock: Was Warren Buffett Wrong to Sell All Airline Stocks? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock: Was Warren Buffett Wrong to Sell All Airline,"      Cindy Dye | May 29, 2020 | More on: AC Legendary investor Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made headlines a few weeks ago when he disclosed that he had sold all of his stake in airline stocks. Berkshire Hathaway had previously held positions in four major U.S. airlines. These companies include Delta Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines. For years Buffett had avoided airline stocks altogether. In 2002, Buffett remarked about the airline industry, “You’ve got huge fixed costs, you’ve got strong labor unions and you’ve got commodity pricing. That is not a great recipe for success.” So it came as a surprise that Buffett would jump into airline stocks in the first place. Similarly, it came as a surprise that he would so quickly reverse course and sell his entire position. Berkshire Hathaway owned over 10% in both Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines before selling. According to Buffett, “The world changed for airlines” due to the travel shutdowns caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Warren Buffett made his fortune as the Oracle of Omaha by buying stocks he considers a great value. He invests in companies with sound fundamentals, but investor sentiment has beaten down the price of the stocks. Even with a fantastic track record, which has made many investors in Berkshire Hathaway very wealthy, Buffett has made mistakes. Buffett readily admits he was wrong about tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft. Although Buffett eventually jumped on board and loaded up on Amazon stock, he was relatively late to the game. It wasn’t until 2019 that Berkshire purchased Amazon stock. In a CNBC interview, Buffett remarked, “I’m a fan, and I’ve been an idiot for not buying.” Although Buffett has made some mistakes, he has been right enough most of the time that many investors follow Buffett’s lead. That is exactly what happened with his recent announcement that he had abandoned airline stocks. Shortly after Buffett’s announcement, shares in American, Delta, United, and Southwest fell 7.7%, 6.4%, 5%, and 5.7%, respectively. For the past two years and prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, stock in Air Canada (TSX:AC) had been on a solid trajectory upward. As of this writing, shares are trading at $16.27. While that is a steep decline from the previous high of $52.71, shares are well above their 52-week low of $9.26.

The Dow ended the day up over 550 points. On Mad Money, Jim Cramer looked at the stocks that have the best chance of leading the U.S. and the stock market towards a sustainable economic recovery. TheStreet's Katherine Ross spoke with Cramer yesterday about buying Nvidia stock and Advanced Micro Devices stock, Dr. Fauci impacting stocks with his optimism, and Southwest Airlines is up this week despite question marks in the airline industry. There are two stocks you should consider having in your portfolio right now. One is Advanced Micro Devices  (AMD) - Get Report which is announced that they are planning to launch a CPU in June for counter Intel's new plan. The other stock is one of Cramer's favorites, Nividia  (NVDA) - Get Report. Buying Nvidia stock is always a good idea, especially after falling 20 points since last week. Investors should be considering adding Nvidia to their portfolio and Cramer explains why that would be a wise decision. Has Dr. Fauci created a level of optimism that is sustainable in this market? Some of the comments last week led investors to believe it is unlikely that we see a second wave of the coronavirus and that a vaccine could be closer than we anticipate.

13,"5 Brutal Lessons Learned After Losing $5,292.91 From Short Selling - Traders Magazine",". . . . 5 Brutal Lessons Learned After Losing $5,292.91 From Short Selling. What Is Short Selling?. My Experience","In early March, my co-worker told me that he made thousands of dollars by shorting airline stocks. He bought right when news of the coronavirus spread, and the airline stocks were still at high prices. Their stock prices tanked, and he made out like a bandit. I’ve never short sold in my life, but hearing his story made me feel like I should. Surely, anyone with an ounce of foresight could’ve predicted that airline stocks would drop like rocks. Why didn’t I jump onto the short selling bandwagon sooner? I was missing out on potentially huge gains. I had to try. Before we go further, let’s pause for a second and discuss short selling. For those who don’t know, short selling is a way to make money when stock prices fall. The investor borrows a stock, sells it, and then covers their short by buying the stock. If the stock price went down, the investor makes the difference. However, if the stock price rises, the investor’s short loses that much money. For example, pretend that Joe wants to short Duff Beer’s stock, which is worth $50. Joe goes through his brokerage and shorts 20 Duff Beer stocks for a total of $1,000. Duff Beer’s stock drops from $50 to $40, so Joe decides to cover his short. He makes a profit of $10 for each share for a total of $200. But what if Duff Beer went to $60 instead of $40? Since the price went up by $10, Joe would be down $200 as long as he held onto his shares. He could cover his shorts or hold onto them and hope that they go back down. Shorting is an exciting way to make a quick buck in a volatile market, but it’s extremely risky. You have to pay the difference on however much the price changes. If the price skyrockets, you’ll lose that much money. For example, if Duff Beer’s stock went from $50 to $90, Joe would’ve had to pay the $40 difference on all 20 of his stocks — a total of $800. There’s no limit as to how high stock prices can soar, so there’s no limit to how much money you can lose. Additionally, most brokerages require you to pay a fee for each day you hold a short. The costs are usually aren’t high (about $0.18 for me), but they can add up","May 29, 2020",https://www.tradersmagazine.com/retail-report/5-brutal-lessons-learned-after-losing-5292-91-from-short-selling/
