0,Airlines Had a Terrible Quarter. Here’s What Could Be Next for Their Stocks. | Barron's,Airlines Had a Terrible Quarter. Here’s What Could Be Next for Their Stocks.. . . Convertible Securities Are Having Their,"    Major airlines survived what was likely the worst quarter in modern aviation history. The carriers lost billions of dollars, as expected, and the theme that emerged is that their recovery stalled in July as Covid-19 cases rose and states imposed quarantine measures. Most airlines are now cutting back on scheduled flights for the rest of the summer and early fall, hunkering down to conserve cash. Analysts are still adjusting their price targets and estimates for the industry. But so far, there don’t appear to be many rating changes or reversals. Opinions, quite simply, remain all over the airline map. J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker maintained his Underweight rating on American Airlines Group (ticker: AAL). A sum-of-the-parts analysis, including the value of American’s mileage loyalty program, brand, gate slots, and other assets would imply $70 billion in value, more than 10 times the carrier’s $6 billion equity-market capitalization. But American’s equity value is “trapped” by debt and other liabilities, expected to top $40 billion by the end of 2020, Baker writes. American’s revenue base won’t get back to 2019 levels for a few more years; it is expected to be 74% of its 2019 level in 2021. And without a way out of its debt (short of a bankruptcy reorganization), Baker writes that “it’s challenging for us to envision taking a more bullish view,” even if the stock falls meaningfully from here. Baker also sees more risk than reward in shares of Spirit Airlines (SAVE), rating it Underweight. However, he did raise his price target on Southwest Airlines (SAVE) to $41 from $40, maintaining a Neutral rating. And he has an Overweight on Alaska Air Group (ALK), raising his price target to $55 from $54. Citi’s Stephen Trent’s rates Southwest at Neutral with a $38 target, and argues that American’s stock has more downside, rating it at Sell with a $14 target. He is positive on Spirit, writing that the carrier “looks well positioned to capitalize on the gradual rebound of visiting friends and relatives (VFR) and tourism travel.” However, he trimmed his price target from $22 to $21. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth doesn’t see much upside in American, rating it at Underperform. She maintained the equivalent of Neutral ratings on United Airlines (UAL) and Spirit, and said she prefers Delta Air Lines (DAL) among the legacy carriers. She also sees more gains for Southwest, rating","Jul 25, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/airline-s-had-a-bad-quarter-analysts-look-at-what-comes-next-51595605403
1,COVID-19 Impact: Know why stock prices of airline companies take a toll during pandemics,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . COVID-19 Impact: Know why stock,"New Delhi | Jagran Business Desk: Amid these testing times of coronavirus pandemic, when every sector is affected by this unprecedented crisis and has halted functioning of almost every activity, the airline industry is one of the worst-hit sectors affected by coronavirus-induced lockdowns. The coronavirus crisis has also resulted in a sharp decline in stocks of airline companies as compared to other pandemics in the past decades.    Published in the ‘International Journal of Humanities and Social Science Invention’ (IJHSSI), the research was done by entrepreneur Paleesha Parwani and analyses the decline in airline stock prices during the past pandemics and their impact on the airline's stock price currently.   In the journal, Paleesha outlined the fluctuations in shares of American Airlines due to the Zika virus in 2015-16, and Delta Airlines due to the swine flu pandemic in 2009-10. Along with this, she has also analysed the time at which the stock of an airline stock declines, when it remains stable and for what reasons.   2009-10: How Delta Airlines' share price has been affected due to swine flu In the journal, she noted that despite Swine Flu was less deadly than coronavirus it created panic in America and led to declining in the shares of Delta Airlines from USD 8 to USD 5.4 within a month. However, the stock prices remain steady between USD 5-6 but jumped again in the month of July as the havoc of swine flu was decreased. The share prices decreased again in October when swine flu infections started coming again. In 2009, Paleesha noted, that the stock prices of Delta Airlines remained in ‘Drop-Stay-Rise’ model.       2015-16: American Airlines In 2015-16, the Zika Virus has scared the world, most prominently evident in the South American countries. Due to the pandemic, the stock prices of American Airlines decreased sharply within a month of the start of the pandemic, from nearly USD 55 to USD 30, but as soon as scientists identified that the virus is more dangerous to pregnant women only, the stock prices again increased rapidly and reached USD 45 by mid of 2016.  Comparison and conclusion from the current scenario After analysis in this report, it has been found that the price fluctuations of the stock at the time of an epidemic depends on how contagious and how deadly that disease is.","Jul 25, 2020",https://english.jagran.com/business/covid19-impact-know-why-stock-prices-of-airline-companies-take-a-toll-during-pandemics-10014422

5,Available Seat Miles (ASM) Definition,Available Seat Miles (ASM). What Is Available Seat Miles (ASM). KEY TAKEAWAYS. Understanding Available Seat Miles (ASM). . How Available,"Available seat miles (ASM) is a measure of an airplane's carrying capacity available to generate revenues. Available seat miles refers to how many seat miles are actually available for purchase on an airline. Seat miles are calculated by multiplying the number of miles that a given airplane will be flying by the number of seats available for a given flight. ASM is simply a measure of a flight's revenue-generating abilities based upon traffic. For investors analyzing airlines, ASM is a very important metric in deciding which airlines are best at generating revenues from the availability of seats to customers. If all of the seats on the plane are not sold, then the ASM of the airline is operating at below capacity. Long instances of unavailable seats on an airline can cost an airline million of dollars. Also known as available seat kilometers in some markets, this metric is used by airlines and statistics keepers because of the variances in aircraft and their seating configurations. The metric can not only measure the performance of individual airlines but the commercial airline industry as a whole. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics, for instance, keeps a running monthly and annual record of domestic, international, and total available seat miles for all carriers and airports. ASM on its own might not provide the full picture of an air carrier’s financial performance. While the metric does represent the capacity and occupancy of aircraft, revenue passenger miles and revenue per available seat miles are other ways to calculate the money generated by flights. This may be compared against the cost per available seat mile to determine the profitability of each flight. Not every seat on a plane that is occupied generates revenue for the carrier. Seats used by an airline’s personnel, for example, to connect with a flight crew they will work with, are non-revenue passengers. Certain types of standby passengers might also occupy seats, but not generate revenue for the airline. Airlines may need to transport non-revenue passengers out the necessity to move flight crews around or to fulfill obligations to passengers who have been guaranteed passage on the carrier. How airlines balance such non-revenue passengers against its seats occupied by paying customers can directly affect the profitability of each flight. Pricing of seats and capacity of the aircraft all factor into understanding the health of a carrier; however, such elements as the costs of fuel,","Jul 25, 2020",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/availableseatmiles.asp
6,3 Top Robinhood Stocks You Shouldn't Even Consider Buying | The Motley Fool,"3 Top Robinhood Stocks You Shouldn't Even Consider Buying. Unless you love risk, you probably won't want to invest in","   Robinhood is a great place to see which stocks are in vogue. The trading platform is popular with millennials, and many of the best-performing stocks on the markets find themselves on the Robinhood 100 list. However, not all of these widest-held investments are necessarily good buys, particularly during the economic turmoil that has resulted from the coronavirus pandemic. The three stocks listed below are among the hottest Robinhood stocks right now, but they're also investments that you should keep far away from your portfolio. Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) is a top stock on Robinhood, but the Ontario-based pot producer really shouldn't be a crowd favorite. Considering its lack of sales growth, recurring operating losses, and a high price-to-sales multiple of more than 80, it's obvious that there are better pot stocks than Cronos. It's also generally not a great sign when a company restates multiple financial statements -- which Cronos did for three quarters in 2019 because its sales numbers were wrong. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. There is no shortage of red flags, including earlier this month when investors learned, through a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, that Robert Rosenheck, CEO and co-founder of Lord Jones, was leaving the company. Cronos acquired Lord Jones a year ago in a cash-and-stock deal worth $300 million to compete in what's already a competitive hemp-derived CBD (cannabidiol) market in the U.S. High-ranking departures aren't rare, especially in the cannabis industry. However, it's not a great sign, especially when a company's co-founder leaves so quickly after their company is acquired. When taking into account all the other issues related to this stock, investors should think more than twice about investing your dollars here. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is another popular Robinhood stock despite very little air travel going on in the past few months. The airline reported its second-quarter results on July 23 and it incurred a loss of $2.1 billion as operating revenue declined by a whopping 86% from the prior-year period. Although expenses were also slashed, they dropped by 62% and weren't deep enough to offset the steep fall in sales. Over the past six months, American Airlines burned through $1.1 billion in cash from its day-to-day operating activities. It's bad news when two key areas on the Texas-based company's earnings release were ""conserving cash"" and ""bolstering liquidity."" Those are not concerns investors normally have about businesses that are in good","Jul 26, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/26/3-top-robinhood-stocks-you-shouldnt-even-consider.aspx
7,2 Top Stocks From Robinhood Investors | The Motley Fool,2 Top Stocks From Robinhood Investors. A pair of beleaguered companies made it onto Robinhood's list of 100 most popular,"   The Robinhood app kicked off a race to zero commissions among many stock trading platforms. In leading that trend, it has built a loyal following of passionate investors eager to carve out their own success in the market. Its user base has grown from one million to 13 million in just four years, despite new competition and some highly-publicized app crashes. Robinhood's ""100 Most Popular"" stock collection -- based on the number of users who hold a particular stock through the app -- includes some risky names such as Genius Brands. Interestingly, the list also has some intriguing, beaten-down companies that could be ripe for a comeback. Here are two that look promising. IMAGE SOURCE: BOEING For Boeing (NYSE:BA), a combination of authorities grounding the 737 MAX and COVID-19 dissolving air travel demand has been extremely difficult. Issues with the best-selling aircraft have cost the company $18.4 billion dollars in various losses and write-offs. The fallout of that crisis led to former CEO Dennis Muilenburg's dismissal in Dec. 2019, and the iconic manufacturer has shed nearly 50% of its market cap year to date. And even if the 737 MAX were recertified, few passengers are flying. Brighter days, however, could be ahead. Through this year of headwinds, Boeing's order backlog still stands at over 5,000 planes. The global duopoly it shares with Airbus ultimately gives Boeing enviable demand inelasticity, even in historically tough times. Competition simply cannot go anywhere else as Airbus has its own production backlog with thousands of aircraft to work through. Many airlines will stay in line for their Boeing orders to avoid running into shortages as the industry likely recovers in the coming years. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) finished a series of test flights this month to get the MAX back in the air, and the company hopes that will happen by the end of 2020. TSA checkpoint data remains well off pre-pandemic levels, but travel has risen materially from 100,000 daily passengers in April to 700,000 in mid-July. Progress in the race to discover a coronavirus vaccine would aid Boeing's rally more than any in-house initiative. In a recent interview, Dr. Anthony Fauci reiterated his prediction that the U.S. will have at least one approved vaccine by year-end. Boeing stock has managed to recover over 80% from the lows hit in March, but it remains depressed, offering a good entry point","Jul 26, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/26/2-top-stocks-from-robinhood-investors.aspx
8,American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Just Released Its Second-Quarter Earnings: Here's What Analysts Think,. . . S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD.,"                                                   American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) just released its latest quarterly results and things are looking bullish. Revenues and losses per share were both better than expected, with revenues of US$1.6b leading estimates by 6.8%. Statutory losses were smaller than the analystsexpected, coming in at US$4.82 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. Check out our latest analysis for American Airlines Group After the latest results, the consensus from American Airlines Group's 15 analysts is for revenues of US$17.3b in 2020, which would reflect a sizeable 48% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Per-share losses are expected to explode, reaching US$16.90 per share. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$19.2b and losses of US$17.92 per share in 2020. So there seems to have been a moderate uplift in analyst sentiment with the latest consensus release, given the upgrade to loss per share forecasts for this year. The consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$12.66, implying that the business is performing roughly in line with expectations, despite adjustments to both revenue and earnings estimates. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on American Airlines Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$27.00 and the most bearish at US$1.00 per share. So we wouldn't be assigning too much credibility to analyst price targets in this case, because there are clearly some widely different views on what kind of performance this business can generate. With this in mind, we wouldn't rely too heavily the consensus price target, as it is just an average and analysts clearly have some deeply divergent views on the business.","Jul 26, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-group-inc-nasdaq-120224572.html

British Airways owner considers,"   With the new Spain quarantine order imposed by the UK government it would be interesting to see how the airline stocks (IAG, EZJ, TUI) performs tomorrow. Do any of these carry a risk of going down in the next year? Yes all of them carry the risk. I don’t think the spanish and british governments will let IAG go bust, I don’t think it can happen, however, there is the possibility of shareholders being VERY diluted if things go very wrong which can result in very heavy losses. On the other hand, there may be significant up side in the medium term of 3-5 years. I think IAG will do well, but its part of my risky portfolio (with the likes of GGP). I think a share issue would be a good idea to give it even more liquidity and in the long term it could result in a very profitable investment. Do any of these carry a risk of going down in the next year? In the next year – all of these are in extreme amounts of strife. IAG has just announced or completed (I dunno, I don’t own the stock) an equity raise, so its share price dropped accordingly. Note that in doing this it is just following the example of various US airlines. I suspect none of these is in danger of going bankrupt but I think these have at least a two year road to recovery. If you’re interested in Graham-style investing for the very long term, then you might like the look of what you see here. But I wouldn’t expect to see substantial improvements in their balance sheets until at least Q3 of 2022. Do any of these carry a risk of going down in the next year? All of them… we are not even talking about the second wave yet. IAG has just announced or completed (I dunno, I don’t own the stock) an equity raise I don’t think it has been officially announced.
What has happened is that they have “grape vined” to the press that they may do an equity raise in September/October, I guess so that the market “can see it coming” and insn’t very surprised when they announce it.

Why,"      Ambrose O'Callaghan | July 25, 2020 | More on: AC Fortunes can change quickly in the investing world. Take, for example, the sharp correction that occurred in the late winter and early spring. Canadian and global markets have enjoyed a steady rebound, even in the face of significant economic uncertainty. Air Canada (TSX:AC) looked very strong to start the year. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced airliners to dramatically scale back operations. Global travel has been devastated. Shares of Air Canada have dropped 65% in 2020 as of close on July 22. Air Canada had a brutal start to the 2010s. Its shares fell below the $1 mark in the spring of 2012. However, it would finish the decade around the $50 mark. A $1,000 investment in this stock in the beginning of the previous decade would have been worth $37,800 as at December 31, 2019. Investors should take a long-term outlook when it comes to Air Canada and the airliner industry at large. Earlier this month, I’d discussed whether investors should jump into Air Canada stock. The company opted to end physical distancing on flights starting July 1. Moreover, it has been critical of the government’s COVID-19 approach. Restrictions have severely impacted the airline and its peers, and its CEO urged governments to consider “proportionality” in their implementation of practices going forward. In Q1 2020, Air Canada projected that it may take three years to recover from the impacts of this devastating pandemic. Fortunately, the consumer drive to travel is starting to heat up, as cases have fallen in Canada. The future should be brighter for Air Canada and its peers in the months ahead. As it stands today, there are four vaccine candidates that have made it to phase-three trails and another three that have made it to phase two. The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that a vaccine is unlikely to arrive until early 2021. This means that the company and other airliners around the world are unlikely to see a return to “normalcy” until the middle of next year at the earliest. Back in May, Warren Buffett elected to bail on the airline bet that he made earlier in the year. Investors are typically eager to follow in the footsteps of the 89-year-old legend.

12,Why Was Suncor Stock Down This Week? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why Was Suncor Stock Down This Week?. A key stock to scale,"      Victoria Hetherington | July 25, 2020 | More on: SU SU Down 3.8% Thursday, Suncor Energy (TSX:SU)(NYSE:SU) continued to pay the price for oil’s worst ever year. A perfect storm of oversupply, protectionism, deglobalization, and faltering demand had paved the way for an unexpected pandemic to sweep in and finish off the oil industry. Even bullish pundits threw in the towel on hydrocarbons. From the vantage point of 2020, the future is green when it comes to energy. Suncor posted a bigger-than-expected drop in profits in what has proven so far to be a damning Q2 across the board. Even some of the steadiest-rolling names on the TSX — notably, our two major rail operators — saw a disastrous second quarter. However, since Suncor was already such a divisive name, even before the tire fire that is 2020, let’s take a deeper dive into the ailing oil producer. Production fell by around one-fifth during Suncor’s Q2. But one can’t help feeling output would have been slashed a lot more harshly had oil producers realized earlier on what was in the pipeline for April. Fast forward to the present day, and oil producers are urging caution when it comes to turning the taps back on. Suncor is among them. A loss of $614 million is nothing to be sniffed at. Especially in an industry that saw its major commodity — oil — not only lose all value for a moment, but actually trade briefly for negative dollars. The thesis for buying Suncor stock right now simply could not be weaker. Selling just below its book price, Suncor is cheap. But it could be cheaper. Suncor’s mediocre valuation makes a value thesis hard to defend. There are two big problems with Suncor’s market ratios. First of all, a recovery is baked into the market. Investors expect things to get better. This means that equities don’t have as much upside as they could. On the contrary, stocks have plenty of downside. There is plenty of scope for investors to be disappointed in the latter half of the year. Second, Suncor’s 36-month beta of 1.7 highlights a level of volatility that is significantly frothier than the market. This is not a stock for low-risk investors in the current situation. However, despite being down by 43.4% since this time last year, neither is this a value play. At least,","Jul 25, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/07/25/why-was-suncor-stock-down-this-week/

About this tool Research-based policy analysis and commentary from leading economists Create account | Login | Subscribe The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on safe haven assets Muhammad Cheema, Robert Faff, Kenneth Szulczyk 25 July 2020 The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the financial markets, which has triggered a flight from risky assets to safe haven assets. This column compares the performance of the safe havens across the world’s ten largest economies during COVID-19 and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The findings suggest that the character of safe haven assets has changed since the 2008 crisis. Gold, the traditional safe haven asset, has lost its glitter. However, the Swiss franc, the US dollar and US Treasuries retained their safe haven status, and Tether, a cryptocurrency, shows some promise. A A The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved from a health crisis into a severe economic crisis as countries around the world closed their economies and prevented the movement of, and interaction between, people as a means to slow the spread of the virus. The economic crisis initially led to a massive selloff in the financial markets as investors transferred risky assets into safe haven assets to protect their wealth (Bofinger et al. 2020, Wyplosz 2020). Consequently, COVID-19 has struck the stock markets more severely than any previous infectious disease outbreak, including the 1918 Spanish Flu (Baker et al. 2020). The pace and severity of investors fleeing from risky assets to safe havens raises the question: How safe are the safe haven assets? Traditionally, precious metals (gold and silver), currencies (US dollar and Swiss franc), and US Treasuries (T-bill and T-bond) are regarded as safe havens during times of crises. Moreover, a few researchers claim that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have also joined the rank of safe haven assets (e.g. Urquhart and Zhang 2019). However, others view cryptocurrencies as a risky asset instead of a safe haven (e.g. Cheema et al. 2020). Therefore, Baur and Hoang (2020) suggest using asset-backed cryptocurrencies, such as Tether, as a safe haven against Bitcoin during extreme market movements. Tether is the first and largest asset-backed cryptocurrency (i.e. a stablecoin). Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to other stable assets such as gold and traditional currencies. Therefore, stablecoins, in theory, would become as stable as the","Jul 25, 2020",https://voxeu.org/article/influence-covid-19-pandemic-safe-haven-assets
