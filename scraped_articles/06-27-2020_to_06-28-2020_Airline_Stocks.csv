0,What Airline Stocks Should You Buy? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . What Airline Stocks Should You Buy?. Is Air Canada still an airline,"      Demetris Afxentiou | June 28, 2020 | More on: AC CJT There is no industry that has been as battered as much as airline stocks have in recent months. I realize that the idea of hundreds of passengers locked in a metal tube being flung through the sky in recycled air seems less than ideal at the moment. That said, there is a case for investing in airline stocks at the moment. Let’s take a look at two options to consider. Air Canada (TSX:AC) is the largest airline in Canada. Until the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, Air Canada was one of the best-performing investments of the past decade. Currently, Air Canada is down over 60% year to date. Ouch. Most investors know that prior performance isn’t indicative of future potential. What is worth reminding investors is the inverse also holds true. Future potential can’t always be assumed based off current performance (or lack thereof). To put it another way, Air Canada’s stock price plummeted because the market has all but evaporated (albeit artificially). But does that make Air Canada a good investment right now? Not really. The company released results for the first fiscal of 2020 last month. While not entirely unexpected, the results were dismal. Air Canada reported EBITDA of $71 million for the quarter. By comparison, in the same period last year, Air Canada posted $583 million. Overall the company reported an operating loss of $433 million in the quarter. To put that into perspective, this was the first quarterly update that did not report year-over-year revenue growth in 27 quarters. Finally, with capacity reductions of up to 90% in place for the current quarter, there could be further losses in store for the subsequent quarters. Where does this leave investors? Potential would-be investors should bypass Air Canada altogether, and opt for a different airline stock. Unlike Air Canada, Cargojet (TSX:CJT) has seen tremendous growth during the pandemic. A key point here is that Cargojet doesn’t transport passengers, but cargo. That business has swelled during the pandemic, as demand for cargo shipments surged while international air routes disappeared. Adding to that volume was a surge in demand to purchase necessities online. To be fair, Cargojet already has a lucrative deal with an e-commerce behemoth, so this recent spike in demand only fuelled further growth. This is a unique advantage that Cargojet","Jun 28, 2020",https://www.fool.ca/2020/06/28/what-airline-stocks-should-you-buy/

Airline stocks are in for another major decline come autumn as a wave of mass bankruptcies is looking more and more likely. By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. There’s no question that the global pandemic has hit the travel sector the hardest. Airline stocks have been some of the worst-hit as the highly-leveraged businesses behind them struggle against high fixed costs. Government bailouts saved U.S. airlines back in April, but things could get much worse for the industry before they get better. There are many reasons to expect a wave of bankruptcies in the airline sector, not least of which is the pandemic. As long as contracting a potentially deadly, airborne virus is on the cards, travel won’t return to normal levels. That’s especially true in the U.S., where driving is possible for most destinations. Most people will choose sitting alone in a car over packing into a small space with hundreds of strangers. Just the fear of renewed virus outbreaks is enough to halt air travel and crush airline stocks. But now that some U.S. states are seeing spikes in new cases, there are even more complications for carriers. Legislators are starting to implement 14-day quarantine measures for travelers who’ve visited a hotspot. It appears international leaders are also planning to put the breaks on U.S. visitors. European leaders are considering barring U.S. travelers from entering once the region’s borders reopen. Even if America can control the most recent outbreaks, airlines are going to need","Jun 28, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/airline-stocks-crash-landing-tidal-wave-bankruptcies/
2,UAL: United Airlines Stock Is In For a Bumpy Landing | InvestorPlace,United Airlines Is In For a Bumpy Landing. UAL has the potential to go bankrupt in the wake of the," Just a few weeks ago, it looked like there could be hope for United Airlines (NYSE:UAL). The U.S. economy had reopened, air travel started to pick up and United Airlines stock was within touching distance of $50 per share. But over the past few weeks, things have taken a turn for travel stocks and UAL has suffered a 32% decline because of it. Most of the reason for investors’ about-face on United has to do with the apparent resurgence of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. As cases continue to surge in several states, the appeal of airline travel is dropping. Many states are mulling over travel restrictions and countries around the world are coming up with ways to limit travel between countries suffering from outbreaks. All in all, it’s a terrible environment for airlines and it’s likely to continue for the foreseeable future. There’s a good chance that many states may start to ask travelers to self-quarantine for 14 days in order to keep outbreaks from spreading. That would be disastrous for airlines because it creates yet another barrier that will keep people from traveling. Now that businesses have reopened in the U.S., the thought of being confined to your home for two weeks will likely deter many people from traveling. But even in the absence of tightened restrictions, United is going to struggle to get people on its planes as long as Covid-19 is a factor. As cases surge in several cities, there’s likely a renewed fear of being enclosed in small spaces with a crowd. As the coronavirus is airborne, sitting in close quarters for hours with a few hundred people isn’t a chance many are willing to take. Plus, travel within the U.S., which was expected to recover first for United, can be done by car. Sitting solo or with family members, without a mask, makes domestic travel far less risky and will trump the prospect of airline travel for many people.  With that in mind, United Airlines stock looks like a dud, even in the longer term. The fact that coronavirus cases are surging in the summer, when they were supposed to diminish, suggests an autumn or winter second wave is almost inevitable. At the very least, it’s likely. There’s essentially no way for UAL to continue operating unless the government offers the airline another cash infusion. That’s because the airlines are heavily","Jun 28, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/06/ual-united-airlines-stock-is-in-for-a-bumpy-landing/

4,The Smartest People on Wall Street Are Buying These 2 Stocks -- Should You? | The Motley Fool,The Smartest People on Wall Street Are Buying These 2 Stocks -- Should You?. These two stocks may be why,"     Using the investment ideas of billionaire investors and money managers is a good launching pad for your own stock research.  Now, don't blindly follow the so-called smart money, because even they get it wrong sometimes. Just look at how Warren Buffett came to quickly regret his airline investments to understand that even the best stock pickers can err. Long gaps can also occur between when they've bought the stocks and when they report it, so the initial thesis may have changed. But seeing the stocks they picked as the basis for beginning your due diligence is a great start, and the two stocks below were bought by some of the best in the business, so let's see if they are still worthwhile investments. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Jim Cramer recently put his stamp of approval on golf club and accessories maker Callaway Golf (NYSE:ELY) because ""That's one of the few sports you're allowed to do [during the COVID-19 pandemic]."" Yet before he weighed in, Prem Watsa, who has been dubbed Canada's Warren Buffett, disclosed he had taken a small stake in Callaway, some 47,000 shares valued at $480,000, which suggests a value of around a $10 per share. When Callaway reported first-quarter earnings last month, President and CEO Chip Brewer said the golf pro had been ""on track for another record sales year, which would have made it our fourth consecutive record year."" But it ran into the brick wall of the pandemic, and now it expects the crisis to have ""a significant impact on our results."" Brewer says it's only temporary, though, because, as Cramer intimated, it's a sport that's compatible with social distancing. Callaway's stock has risen nearly 250% since the March lows and currently sits around $16.50 per share, though that's still some 25% below the highs it hit earlier this year. Activist investor Jana Partners may think the golfing specialist has landed in the rough.  One year ago, the private equity firm revealed it had taken a 9% stake in Callaway with an eye toward having the company sell all or parts of its business, but that may no longer be a priority as it has since pared its holdings in the company.  Earlier this year, Jana cut its stake by 17%, then just this month cut it almost another 10% to 5.9 million shares, or 6.3% of","Jun 27, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/27/the-smartest-people-on-wall-street-are-buying-thes.aspx

Investors should take a 'leap of faith' on select stocks despite a crisis that's 'worse than the Great Depression,’","   Cindy Ord/Getty Images  Tom Lee is not wavering one bit on his bullish call on stocks despite the global coronavirus crisis being ""worse than the Great Depression."" In a CNBC interview on Friday, the strategist said investors should take ""a leap of faith"" and invest in the ""reopening"" stocks that stand to benefit from the US economy opening back up. Lee's FundStrat prepared a list of these ""epicenter"" stocks that investors should consider buying as the economy slowly reopens. The ""reopening"" stocks include airlines, cruise lines, hotels, and casinos, among others.

""The ones that survive are going to be unkillable,"" Lee explained.

Alternatively, surging coronavirus cases in states like Florida and Texas prove that the reopening process for states is a delicate process. Lee said that it makes sense for stocks to cool off, given that they are overbought in the short term and consolidation is healthy for markets. Additionally, Lee expects selling into quarter-end as investors rebalance their portfolios following a strong quarter for stocks. But as long as the markets continue to hold their 200-day moving average, that's ""good news,"" said Lee.

comments  Many months have passed since the world's stock markets were first shocked by the fallout from coronavirus.  In the meantime, the lockdown has hammered the travel and hospitality sectors and taken huge bites out of the share prices of manufacturing firms, construction groups and retailers.  Finally, next weekend, the most ravaged of these hibernating businesses will emerge, blinking into the light at the end of the lockdown tunnel as pubs, restaurants, hotels, cinemas and hair salons are able to throw open their doors.  Pulling power: Stocks in pub chain Marston's, Ryanair, Carnival and WH Smith are all being considered by fund managers But while business should pick up, share prices in many of these companies are a long way from recovering. Some companies are still down 70 per cent from their pre-Covid levels.  According to investment analysts, that means there are still some great bargains lurking for investors, even after a bounce-back in the FTSE100 index as the lockdown has eased.  Asset manager Morgan Stanley Investment Management this month said there were 'buying opportunities' among undervalued stocks that could bounce back rapidly coming out of recession.  Managing director Andrew Slimmon told Ian King Live on Sky News that while many airlines, cruise and travel stocks had already rebounded strongly, financial companies, industrial firms and housing stocks were 'very cheap' relative to the big tech companies such as Facebook and Google.  Interactive Investor's Dilov says there are still some quality value strategies  In fact, some analysts think we could be witnessing a shift in the markets away from 'growth' investing – where the best-performing shares are young or small companies whose earnings are set to soar – and towards 'value' investing, where out-of-fashion stocks quickly recover lost ground.  Teodor Dilov, fund analyst at Interactive Investor, says: 'Although the style of managers who hunt for undervalued opportunities has been out of favour for a while, there are some quality strategies that could provide exposure to 'bargain' stocks.'  Similarly, Darius McDermott, managing director of independent research firm FundCalibre, says: 'When it comes to true 'value' funds, there are not that many left after a painful few years in which the style has been out of favour.

Subscribe,"A Periodic Journal Containing Items of Interest From the World of Directors & Officers Liability, With Occasional Commentary One of the shorthand expressions sometimes used to refer to shareholder class action litigation is to call them “stock drop lawsuits.” Securities suits do indeed involve stock drops. But how often do stock drops actually result in lawsuits? That is the interesting questions asked in the following guest post from Stanford Law School Professor Michael Klausner and Sam Blake Curry and Jason Hegland of Stanford Securities Litigation Analytics. I would like to thank the authors for allowing me to publish their article as a guest post on this site. I welcome guest post submissions from responsible authors on topics of interest to this blog’s readers. Please contact me directly if you would like to submit a guest post. Here is the authors’ article. ******************* One often hears that “whenever there is a stock drop, there will be a lawsuit.” This of course is an overstatement. But how much of an overstatement is it?  In this post, we answer that question in some detail.  We identify all net-of-market stock drops of specified sizes in 2017 for common shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ, and we determine what fraction of those stock drops led to securities class actions.[i] We then look at the distribution of net-of-market stock drops that led to lawsuits. We choose 2017 because it is long enough ago for nearly all potential lawsuits to have materialized,[ii] and recent enough to capture current practices among plaintiffs’ counsel in deciding to file lawsuits.   How Common Are Large Stock Drops? We begin by looking at the universe of single-day, net-of-market stock drops of 10% or more in the price of common shares.[iii] We sort firms into quartiles by market capitalization as of the time of the drop, and we look at the distribution of stock drops among firms in each quartile.[iv] Figure 1 shows counts of stock drops above 10% among firms in each quartile. As shown in that figure, within each quartile, the frequency of stock drops decreases as the size of the drop increases, which is not surprising.  In addition, the number of stock drops of a given size range declines as one compares firms across size quartiles.  For example, taking drops in the 10% to 15% range, there were 1,794","Jun 28, 2020",https://www.dandodiary.com/2020/06/articles/securities-litigation/guest-post-stock-drop-lawsuits/
