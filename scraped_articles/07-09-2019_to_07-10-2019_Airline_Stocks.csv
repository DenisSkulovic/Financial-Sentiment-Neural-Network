RECOVERY WITH THE FT Daniel Shane in Hong Kong Shares in one of the Philippines’ largest airlines plunged by almost 40 per cent before recovering almost all of their value, prompting talk among brokers of a ‘fat finger’ error. The curious movements in Cebu Air’s stock began late in Tuesday’s trading session in Manila, when shares in the airline collapsed by 37 per cent to 58 Philippine pesos ($1.13) during the run-off period immediately prior to the bourse’s close. Orders to buy or sell cannot be cancelled during the run-off period, traders said. That represented the airline’s biggest one-day fall since going public nearly a decade ago. Cebu Air’s share price did not stay down for long. On Wednesday, the stock surged 50 per cent to 87 pesos at the market’s open, which is where it stayed for the rest of the day. Traders said the initial plunge in the stock had been caused by a major broker erroneously entering a sell order at a low-ball price of 58 pesos, rather than 98 pesos, a share. “Other brokers went in and bought the …order,” said Rens Cruz, an analyst at Regina Capital Development in Manila. It was “an obvious trading error”. Traders in the Philippine capital and various media reports identified Quality Investments and Securities, a local broker, as the culprit. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The stock could not immediately recoup all of its losses due to daily trading limits on the Manila exchange, which cap daily price swings at 50 per cent. Liquidity in the stock was also hampered, as few shareholders were willing to sell their shares at a discount to the pre-nosedive price. “Fat-finger errors are common in the world of trading, and their impact can sometimes be magnified by poor liquidity conditions and lack of market depth,” said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore. “Thus, this type of error tends to have a bigger impact in emerging markets.” Traders said that such mishaps are not unheard of in the Philippines equity market, one of the smaller in Asia, but were typically smaller and often go largely unnoticed. Cebu Air, on the other hand, is a $1bn-in-market capitalisation stock with a 0.4 per cent weighting in the main domestic benchmark. The company is also included in various MSCI and FTSE indices. “In the past,","Jul 9, 2019",https://www.ft.com/content/56188540-a2cf-11e9-974c-ad1c6ab5efd1

2,"10 ""Kings of Cash"" Stocks to Buy | Kiplinger","Save up to 67%. 10 ""Kings of Cash"" Stocks to Buy. These companies not only generate high amounts of free","Getty Images Free cash flow (FCF) is one of the most important financial metrics you can study – especially if you’re a buy-and-hold investor. FCF is the cash remaining after a company has paid its expenses, interest on debt, taxes and long-term investments to grow its business. And if a company generates more cash than it needs to run its business, it can do a number of useful things with it, such as pay dividends, buy back its stock, acquire other companies, expand its business and knock out its debts. There’s no right answer as to the best way to use free cash flow. But the ability to consistently grow FCF over the long haul – however it’s put to use – is a proven recipe for higher share prices. Pacer ETFs compiled FactSet data on the Russell 1000 between Dec. 31, 1991, and Dec. 31, 2018. It found that the 100 stocks with the highest free cash flow yields over this period delivered an annualized total return of 17% – almost seven times the annual returns of the 100 stocks with the worst FCF yields. In short, the higher the free cash flow yield, the better. With that in mind, let’s look at 10 free cash flow stocks to buy for the long haul. These companies not only generate high amounts of FCF, but put it to good use via dividends, buybacks and more. We’ll use the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF (COWZ), and its 100 high-FCF-yield components, as a guide. Data is as of July 8. Free cash flow yield is FCF divided by enterprise value (which is market cap plus debt minus cash). 1 of 10 Getty Images Southwest Airlines (LUV, $52.08) hasn’t had a bad year – its total return, which includes dividends, is 11.9% – despite being forced to cancel more than 10,000 flights during the first quarter due to the grounding of the Boeing (BA) 737 Max 8 and 737 Max 9. The cancellations, combined with the impact of the government shutdown and weakness in leisure travel, reduced Southwest’s Q1 2019 projected earnings by $150 million. It ended up with a $387 million first-quarter profit – 16.4% less than what it earned in the year-ago period. (However, thanks to share repurchases over the past year, its earnings per share declined by just 11.4%.) And despite the lower income, Southwest’s free cash flow increased","Jul 10, 2019",https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-10-stocks-to-buy-for-kingly-free-cash-flow/index.html
3,"American Airlines raises unit revenue forecast, shares rise | Reuters","American Airlines raises unit revenue forecast, shares rise. . . . . . . . . . . . ","Discover Thomson Reuters More By Reuters Staff 2 MIN READ (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc on Wednesday raised its estimate for second-quarter unit revenue as the grounding of Boeing Co’s MAX jets left the No. 1 U.S. carrier with fewer aircraft in service, allowing it to fly fuller planes. The company’s shares rose 3% in early trading and also lifted the stocks of other airlines, providing some relief to a sector that has been battered by thousands of flight cancellations and reschedules in the wake of the grounding. The company, however, said its second-quarter pretax profit would be reduced by about $185 million because it canceled over 7,000 flights in the quarter. American Airlines, which has already pulled the MAX off its flying schedule through Sept. 3, had in April cut its annual profit forecast, blaming an estimated $350 million hit from the groundings. The company, which has the second-biggest fleet of MAX aircraft in the United States with 24 jets, now expects unit revenue, a measure that compares sales to flight capacity, to increase between 3% and 4% percent in the quarter ended June, compared with its earlier forecast of a rise of between 1% and 3%. (bit.ly/2Lf12bo) The airline also raised its forecast for quarterly pre-tax margin, excluding certain items, to a range of 8.5% to 9.5%, from 7% to 9%. Analysts have said non-MAX operators such as Delta Air Lines Inc are expected to do much better this year as they would benefit from reduced supply levels in the form of higher load factors and fares. Last week, Delta said its expects its quarterly numbers to be at high end of its previous forecast, helped by “strong demand” in the United States. Delta will report its second-quarter results on Thursday. American Airlines and smaller rival Southwest Airlines Co, which is the world’s biggest MAX operator with 34 jets, are expected to report results later this month.

CNBC Newsletters"," France will introduce an eco-tax on airlines flying out of France, which is expected to raise around 180 million euros ($201.67 million) from 2020, transport minister Elisabeth Borne said on Tuesday. Borne said France will gradually introduce the tax, which will amount to about 1.5 euros for an economy class ticket on flights within France or the European Union, 9 euros for business class tickets, and up to 18 euros for business class ticket for flights out of the EU region. There will be no tax on transit flights. “We have decided to put in place an eco-tax on all flights from France,” Borne said during a news conference, adding that the funds will finance daily transport in France.  Shares of Air France and Lufthansa extended losses and were down 4.5% and 2.5% respectively following the announcement. French President Emmanuel Macron’s government wants to tighten environmental regulation but had to abandon an attempt to increase tax on diesel fuel latelast year following the “yellow vest” protest movement. France wants the new European Union Commission to push for an end to global tax exemptions for jet fuel to reduce CO2 emissions, and has also linked up with the Netherlands try and convince fellow European nations to tax airline travel more.

5,"The last time Boeing did this, it surged 50%","The last time Boeing did this, it surged 50%. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters","The fallout from Boeing’s 737 Max groundings is now clear. In the first half of the year, the aerospace company delivered 37% fewer planes in the wake of two related crashes in the past nine months. The discovery of a software issue in that model line set off a sweep of groundings from domestic and international airlines. Those issues have kept a cap on Boeing shares this year. The stock has added 9% this year, lagging the broader XLI industrials ETF’s 19% increase. Now, one technician sees upside ahead. “There is hope,” said Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “If we look at each of the declines over the last four years, they’re roughly 25-30%. We’re right at a 25% decline right now, holding onto that 200-period moving average.”  The stock tanked 25% in one of the more recent drawdowns from an October peak to a December bottom. From that trough to its March peak, the stock surged more than 50%. Gordon says the stock just needs to remain above one key level for any rebound to have legs. “We really need to hold $310 in that area. If we can, it’s been a symmetrical pullback and we could recover. Below that, and it is an issue,” said Gordon. Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, says the fundamentals picture also supports a comeback in Boeing. “It is being resilient. It’s holding in at this $350 level right now,” said Chiavarone during the same segment. “Our view is you certainly need to get passed this MAX issue, but once you do, demand looks relatively good. You think you can get a return to profitability, cash flow starts to improve — it’s not overly expensive at this point from a value perspective. It may be worth jumping in.” Boeing trades at 19 times forward earnings, tumbling from its peak at a 22 times multiple earlier this year. The S&P 500 trades with a 17 times price-to-earnings ratio.

Shares of InterGlobe Aviation, operator of the","Shares of InterGlobe Aviation, operator of the low-cost carrier IndiGo tanked more than 19 per cent after one of the company’s co-founders Rakesh Gangwal approached market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India or SEBI over alleged corporate governance issues at the airline.

The InterGlobe Aviation shares opened Wednesday at Rs 1,409.20 per share against the previous close of Rs 1,565.75 per share on BSE.  IndiGo co-founder Rakesh Gangwal on Tuesday asked SEBI to intervene in the matter. He has alleged several corporate governance violations by the company’s co-founder Rahul Bhatia including matters relating to related-party transactions, the appointment of senior management personnel. “I have vigorously attempted for almost a year to persuade the company to shore up its governance standards, and all my attempts have been thwarted by the IGE Group,” Gangwal said in a letter to SEBI.  “Beyond just questionable RPTs, various fundamental governance norms and laws are not being adhered to and this is inevitably going to lead to unfortunate outcomes unless effective measures are taken today,” he further added while detailing about the gamut of events occurred in the company violating corporate governance norms. Both the co-founders Gangwal and Bhatia each own less than 40% in Interglobe, giving both co-founders a major say in its strategy and plans. After the feud between both the promoters became public, the CEO of the airline Ronjoy Dutta said the issues between promoters have nothing to do with IndiGo and its functioning. “The issues between them will eventually get sorted out but I want to stress that these issues have nothing to do with the airline and its functioning,” Ronjoy Dutta was quoted as saying in a PTI report.

MSCI's broadest index of world stocks rose 0.37%, with U.S. equities touching record highs following the release of prepared remarks for Powell's testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index briefly hit the 3,000 mark for the first time ever. Powell said the Fed was ready to ""act as appropriate"" to sustain a decade-long U.S. economic expansion and pointed to economic risks including persistently weak inflation, slowing global growth and a downturn in business investment. Minutes released from the Fed's June meeting struck a similar tone as Powell's testimony. Several of the central bank's policymakers said interest rates should come down to soften the blow of a U.S.-China trade war and to firm up inflation. After Powell's remarks and the Fed's minutes, interest rate futures appeared to price in greater odds of an aggressive rate cut this month. Expectations for a 50-basis-point cut, which had nearly been snuffed out following stronger-than-expected U.S. employment data on Friday, jumped to 28.7%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. ""It's what the market wanted to hear,"" said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.

13,interactive investor,FTSE 100's best and worst performers in 2019 so far,"Share on: The blue-chip index jumped over 10% in the first half of this year, but which one surged 68%? It's been a year of widespread and significant gains in the FTSE 100 index, with blue-chip stocks surging by as much as 68% during the first half of 2019. A stunning total of 56 top flight companies registered double-digit percentage gains in the six-month period as London joined a global markets rebound following the pounding for shares at the end of 2018. There were only 17 stocks in negative territory, but unfortunately for retail investors this list is dominated by popular and high-yielding stocks including British Gas owner Centrica (LSE:CNA), BT Group (LSE:BT.A) and British Airways operator International Consolidated Airlines Group (LSE:IAG). In contrast, the leading risers driving the overall 12% improvement in the FTSE 100 index over the first half of 2019 feature a number of top-flight newcomers or stocks from unfancied sectors. JD Sports Fashion (LSE:JD.) meets both criteria after defying the retail gloom to win a place at the top table in June's Footsie reshuffle. Its shares rose 68% to 605.3p in the first half as the owner of more than 2,400 stores continued to benefit from the appetite of millennials and Generation Z customers for athleisure, as well as its ever-growing international footprint. The appearance of Next (LSE:NXT) as the other retailer on the top 10 list may surprise some, given how tough conditions are on the high street. Shares surged 40% in the first quarter of 2019 alone as Next's trading resilience and prodigious cash generation enabled an increase to the dividend and completion of yet another share buy-back. Next is not alone in having built most of its gains in the first quarter of 2019, when it became clear to investors that global monetary policy would remain looser for longer than expected. And from a UK investment perspective, annual results and accompanying dividend announcements have been supportive in the face of so much Brexit uncertainty.

14,Cebu Air Stocks Normalize After Price Drop Error,Cebu Pacific Stocks Normalize After 'Fat Finger' Plunge. How did this happen?. Back to normal ,"Cebu Pacific's stock prices are back to a stable 87.00 following a major price drop on Tuesday, July 9.  An alleged “fat finger,” or typo error, by a local broker caused Cebu Air's share price to plunge as much as 38 percent during the Philippine Stock Exchange's no-cancel period at the end of the day. The stocks closed at 58.00 after opening at 93.40, costing Cebu Air P21.3 billion in market value due to a fat finger, or typo error.  According to an alert from brokerage firm COL Financial Philippines, the error happened due to PSE’s practice of removing dynamic thresholds during closing periods. Dynamic thresholds limit market swings to 10 percent of market prices and only take effect from 9:30 a.m. (when the market opens) to 3:15 p.m.-3:20 p.m. (during the pre-close periods).  “Without the thresholds, the security is open to move within the extreme limits of the day’s price Ceiling and Floor (which is 50% over or below the previous day’s close),” said COL Financial Philippines. After July 9's steep drop in stock prices, Cebu Air’s shares rose by 50 percent the following morning when stocks opened at 87.00 per share, retaining a steady market value throughout the day. On Monday, July 15, Cebu Air fully recovered from the price drop, exceeding their value prior to the trader error by 0.10 with an opening set at 93.50. Less than a week after the plunge, Cebu Air stocks have peaked, with a Tuesday morning opening of 95.20, which is currently their highest opening of 2019. The last week has been a turbulent ride for Cebu Air. The local airline carrier hit both their 52 week low (at 58.00 on July 9) and their 52 week high (at 95.95 on July 16) within the span of seven days. In a company disclosure, Cebu Air confirmed that the plunge was caused by “a trading error made by a Philippine broker in the last few minutes of trading on July 9.” They added that there was “no undisclosed information that may have triggered the unusual price movements “ of Cebu Air shares during this period.

15,Brazil ETFs Hit 52-Week High Amid Pension Reform Vote,Brazil ETFs Hit 52-Week High Amid Pension Reform Vote. Social security overhaul could save almost $800 billion over 20 years.,"Brazil's benchmark stock market proxy, the Bovespa Index (^BVSP), has registered a similar year-to-date (YTD) return to the S&P 500 Index – 19.94% vs. 18.86%. The Bovespa has turned in this solid performance despite Brazil's economic growth shrinking in the first quarter of 2019 and economists expecting it to contract again in the second quarter to record a technical recession – defined by two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Investors have looked beyond the near-term horizon and focused their attention on a groundbreaking broad pension reform bill that aims to overhaul the nation's generous but stifling pension system. A special committee approved the proposed legislation in the lower House of Deputies on July 4, and it now advances for lower house plenary voting. If successful there, the bill moves to Brazil's Senate for final acceptance. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes has estimated that the plan to overhaul the nation's social security system could save as much as 3 trillion reais ($790 billion) over 20 years, per Reuters. Furthermore, the prospect of lower interest rates has also supported Brazilian stocks. Economists expect the country's central bank to slash the official lending rate from an already record low 6.5% to 5.75% by year end. Traders can gain access to the Brazilian economy using these three exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Let's take a closer look at each particular fund and run through several trading plays using technical analysis in the lead-up to the reform bill's expected approval. Launched back in 2000, the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (EWZ) seeks to provide investment results that correspond to the MSCI Brazil 25/50 Index – a benchmark comprising Brazilian equities across all market cap sizes. The enormous $8.79 billion fund tilts toward financials, with nearly 40% of its assets allocated to the sector. It also offers ample exposure to the basic materials, energy, and consumer discretionary sectors, with respective weightings of 13.99%, 13.44%, and 12.53%. The ETF minimizes trading costs with its narrow 0.02% average spread and dollar volume liquidity of $1.08 billion. Its 0.59% management fee sits about double the category average but shouldn't severely affect short holding periods. EWZ has gained 19.94% YTD – returning 10.24% in the past month alone, as of July 10, 2019. The EWZ share price broke above its late-January high on July 5 and has continued trending upward since.

Latest from this section," By Melissa Luz Lopez, CNN Philippines Published Jul 10, 2019 12:11:32 PM Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, July 10) — Cebu Pacific shares recovered on Wednesday morning after a costly trader’s error that plunged the stock’s value from a peak of ₱93.40 to just ₱58 apiece. The quoted price of listed Cebu Air, Inc. (CEB) soared to ₱87 as financial markets reopened, hitting its price ceiling for the day. Current trading rules set by the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) limit valuation changes to a maximum 50 percent increase for day-to-day movements. The error was reportedly committed by a trader from Quality Investments and Securities Corp., who mistakenly sold CEB stocks at a mere ₱58 — far from the quoted rate of the budget airline — which happened just before the closing time of the local bourse. By then, orders could not be cancelled or edited anymore, according to the PSE’s “pre-close” rules that start at 3:15 p.m. Tuesday’s closing rate was a marked plunge, which was at least a one-year low for CEB stocks. These shares were poised to hit another high that day, with the intraday peak quoted at ₱93.70 prior to the mistake. The error is said to have wiped out about ₱21 billion from Cebu Pacific’s market value. CNN Philippines is trying to get the brokerage firm’s comment on the incident. Equity traders said Tuesday’s “fat finger error” — basically, a typo — was a costly mistake, but nothing which the market cannot handle. “Despite being a trading error, the incident involving CEB shares remains within the realm of market buying and selling. At the end of the day, the selling broker will simply incur the cost of selling at such a low price for CEB, and nothing more,” Rens Cruz II, senior equity analyst at Regina Capital, told CNN Philippines. “It is also true that CEB market capitalization was devalued significantly yesterday, but again, market capitalization is a function of price and market sentiment, and is in no way an indication of the financial performance of the business,” he added. Astro Del Castillo, managing director of First Grade Finance, Inc., said separately that prices should return to its normal levels soon. “Of course investors will take advantage of the selloff given the low price, but because of demand, it goes back up to the regular price,” Del Castillo said in a phone interview. “The consequence on","Jul 10, 2019",http://www.cnn.ph/business/2019/7/10/Cebu-Pacific-stocks-recover-trader-error.html

From around P90 apiece, CEB's stock price closed at just P58 – a wipeout of around P21 billion. The closing price is also nowhere near its 52-week range.  The order happened during the bourse's no-cancel period before the end of trading. Brokerage firm COL Financial addressed queries and told investors that the large decline may likely have been caused by a trader's error. ""Given that the PSE (Philippine Stock Exchange) removes dynamic thresholds during closing periods, it does open the stock to be vulnerable to these types of mistakes,"" COL Financial said.  Dynamic threshold prices limit the posting of orders to a certain range of prices based on the last traded price of the stock. These price limits are set by the PSE and are shown in the stock's price quotation. Dynamic thresholds are only in effect during the market open at 9:30 am until the pre-close periods between 3:15 pm and 3:20 pm. The threshold function is not in effect beyond this period. ""Without such thresholds, the security is open to move within the extreme limits of the day's price ceiling and floor, which is 50% over or below the previous day's close,"" COL Financial said.  ""Prices should try to normalize itself into the next trading day or so,"" it added. A Bloomberg article reported that Quality Investment & Securities Corporation was the biggest seller of the stock and caused the error.  The company confirmed to Bloomberg that it did not mean to sell CEB shares. – Rappler.com How did this story make you feel? Did you see something broken?

Air India | budget 2019 Sai Manish  |  New Delhi 
Last Updated at July 9, 2019 15:32 IST Air India’s disinvestment found mention in finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s maiden Budget speech and reports suggest the government is serious about an October deadline to sell off the national carrier.

A look at Budget documents show that from 2014-15 to 2018-19, the Modi government invested almost Rs 24,306 crore in the national airline, including budgetary support for its turnaround. Under the first Modi government, investment in Air India peaked in 2017-18, with Rs 6,427 crore injected into the airline. In the 2019-20 budget, the government has allocated Rs 7,000 crore to Air India Asset Holding Company, which was incorporated as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in 2018. Air India’s debt was transferred to this company under the financial turnaround plan and this money was intended to service loans. In 2019-20, the extra budgetary support to Air India has been slashed to Rs 434 crore – the lowest ever in recent years – which perhaps signals that the new government’s keenness to privatise the carrier.

But even as Air India has received a huge sum from the government, it hasn’t shown much improvement in its financial parameters, despite an improvement in its operational performance. While Air India’s losses in 2017-18 were lower than in 2014-15, they continued to hover above the Rs 5,000 crore mark. Its sister airline, Alliance Air, widened its losses to over Rs 260 crore. A bright spot was perhaps the story of Air India Express, which operates on the lucrative Gulf route among other destinations. It turned profitable in 2015-16 and continued to be so in 2017-18, clocking profits of over Rs 260 crore. Air India has shown an improvement on operational parameters during this period – from passengers carried to departures and even its passenger load factor on its domestic and international operations. But financial resurrection has eluded it.

With the government now looking to sell off Air India by October this year, there may be reasons for investors to consider buying the national airline. With the financial restructuring almost done and","Jul 9, 2019",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/air-india-lost-rs-20-000-crore-as-modi-govt-pumped-rs-24-000-crore-119070900695_1.html
