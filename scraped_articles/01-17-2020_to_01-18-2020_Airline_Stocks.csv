0,Can United Airlines Surge Another 582%? | The Motley Fool,Can United Airlines Surge Another 582%?. Stalling growth may put an end to United’s 582% rise last decade.. . A,"   The 2010s were a good decade for the U.S. stock market, but an even better one for United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) which saw its stock rise 582%. United deserves some serious credit, as it was able to outperform the market. Given that airlines were once considered poor investments by legendary investors like Warren Buffett, this decade of outperformance is all the more impressive. With 2019 fourth-quarter earnings approaching on Jan. 21, now is a great time to reflect on United's strong decade and look at what's in store for this year. UAL DATA BY YCHARTS In many ways, it was the bankruptcy of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Northwest in 2005 that would set the stage for a surge in airline stocks. Back then, it was fuel costs that crippled airline margins, a problem that now seems to be less of a threat given the massive supply increase of U.S. oil that has more than doubled over the past decade. Delta would go on to merge with Northwest in 2008, followed by United Airlines' purchase of Continental Airlines in 2010. Although the deal was just $3.2 billion, it made United the world's largest airline at the time. Fast forward to today, and United currently ranks as the third-largest U.S. airline. Aside from the infamous forcible passenger removal incident on Flight 3411 in 2017, the last five years have been beneficial to United, which has improved its balance sheet and pricing strategy.  United continued to impress in 2019,raising 2019 earnings per share (EPS) guidance in July and again in October to $11.25 to $12.25. 2020 EPS is expected to be $11.00 to $13.00. According to United, third-quarter 2019 adjusted EPS was up 31% year over year (YoY).  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Although third-quarter earnings were impressive, United finds itself facing some difficult comparisons in 2020. One of the challenges for United will be keeping its Cost per Available Seat Mile (CASM) low. CASM, often quoted as CASM-ex when excluding fuel, is a good way for airlines to view their total costs independent of the volatility of oil prices. United President Scott Kirby put it well when he asked on the 2019 Q3 earnings call, ""So how can we continue to invest in our people and our customer experience and drive toward flat CASM-ex? For one thing, we plan to take advantage of increasing gauge."" Changing gauge means","Jan 17, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/17/can-united-airlines-surge-another-582.aspx
1,DAL Stock: Can Delta Stock Fly Higher in 2020 With These Catalysts? | InvestorPlace,"Can Delta Stock Fly Higher in 2020 With These Catalysts?. After a solid 2019, DAL stock will likely continue to","  January has already seen impressive gains in broader markets, and shareholders in the Atlanta-based airline Delta (NYSE:DAL) stock have also enjoyed a year-to-date gain of about 6%.  In the U.S, four major carriers — American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Continental Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) — control about 70% of the domestic market. Furthermore, prices of airline stocks — including DAL — have strongly increased over the past decade. If you had invested $1,000 on Delta shares in mid-January 2010, you would now have about $5,270. This change equates to more than 18% in terms of the compound annual growth rate (CAGR). And the calculation does not take into consideration the actual dividend or further return through the reinvestment of that income. Now, investors are wondering whether the growth story of Delta stock may take a pause, or if they should stay invested Delta shares. Although I believe DAL stock is a good long-term investment, there is likely to be short-term profit-taking in the airline. With that said, let’s take a closer look. On Jan. 14, Delta stock reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations. Revenue reached $11.4 billion, a 7% year-over-year increase. Additionally, adjusted earnings per share came at $1.70, a 31% increase YoY, and it was above the guidance of $1.20 to $1.50 This year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects 1% of global GDP to be spent on air travel. Over the next two decades, the forecast also anticipates about 3.5% CAGR growth. A strong economy, low unemployment and increased consumer spending both in the U.S. and worldwide have been the recent tailwinds for the industry. Additionally, Delta’s Q4 results have confirmed these industry-wide trends. CEO Ed Bastian said that last year was “the best in Delta’s history operationally, financially and for our customers.” Another reason for the airline’s strong earnings has been the fact Delta doesn’t fly Boeing’s (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX. Therefore, the group has not been affected by various adverse developments following the two crashes of the aircraft. Looking forward, Delta management now anticipates an annual revenue growth of 5% to 7% in Q1 2020.  When evaluating stocks, in addition to looking at various fundamental metrics, I also pay attention to possible future changes and trends within a geography or society. Last year, Delta announced an upcoming partnership with LATAM Airlines Group (NYSE:LTM). This will involve an investment of $1.9","Jan 17, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/01/can-delta-stock-fly-higher-catalysts-2020/

Even the best small-cap stocks to,"Getty Images Small-cap stocks lagged the S&P 500 by a wide margin last year. However, strategists say these smaller companies are set to catch up (and more) in 2020. ""We see three favorable factors in place for small-cap stocks: a slow economy, an accommodative Fed, and the calendar, all of which add up to positive prospects for this asset class,"" asset manager Legg Mason says. To get an idea of which small-cap stocks are set to break away from the pack, we scoured the S&P SmallCap 600 Index – which includes stocks worth between $450 million and $2.1 billion at the time they enter the index – looking for names with an average broker recommendation of Buy or Strong Buy. Why? Small caps can be a risky lot given their often narrow businesses and access to capital – but a bullish consensus from the pros is at least a signal that those risks might be smaller compared to their peers, and that the potential upside is worth it. S&P Global Market Intelligence surveys analysts' stock ratings and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals Strong Buy and 5.0 means Strong Sell. Any score of 2.0 or lower means that analysts, on average, rate the stock a Buy. The closer the score gets to 1.0, the stronger the Buy call. We further culled that pool by considering only stocks with market values of at least $1 billion and a minimum of five Strong Buy recommendations. Lastly, we dug into research, fundamentals and headlines. The result is a list of 13 promising small-cap stocks to buy for 2020. 1 of 13 Getty Images NMI Holdings (NMIH, $33.15) – parent of mortgage company National MI – is on a tear, and analysts expect more to come.

""Against a favorable backdrop of lower interest rates and a low unemployment rate, it was not surprising that the company also posted very solid results for (the most recent quarter),"" say analysts at BTIG, which rates shares at Buy. ""All the metrics the company posted during the quarter were impressive."" Meanwhile, shares, which trade at 8.3 times fiscal 2021 earnings, are a rare bargain among the best small-cap stocks to buy.

Most Popular Analysis. EXPLORE TREFIS. ,"United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) will release its full-year 2019 results on Tuesday, January 21. Trefis details expectations from the airline company in an interactive dashboard, parts of which we highlight below. We believe that United Airlines will report revenues and earnings for FY 2019, which are fairly in-line with the consensus. We expect United to report total revenues of $43.4 billion (vs. consensus estimate of $43.3 billion) primarily driven by an upbeat performance by the company’s passenger division. Also, earnings are likely to be around $11.95, which is 32% higher than the figure for 2018 due to lower fuel costs. However, this is slightly below the consensus estimate of $12.00.

5,Utilities sector is enjoying a stealth rally to records,One S&P 500 sector is enjoying a stealth rally to records. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC Newsletters,"There’s been a surprising winner as markets have rallied to records — the utilities sector. The XLU utilities ETF is up 3% this week, nearly double the gain on the S&P 500, and the top performer on markets. Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, sees signs its outperformance can continue. “The story begins, I think, with yields, no surprise here. We’ve seen U.S. bond yields drop,” Gordon said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday. “We’re moving lower here in the 10-year yield following a very clear correlation of declining yields and strong utilities. We’re seeing the XLU … break to new highs so obviously that’s a very strong indicator.” Bond yields and high-dividend sectors such as utilities move inversely — investors hunt for alternative sources of yield in defensive trades such as utilities and real estate investment trusts. “Sometimes I’ve seen these sectors kind of lead the underlying bond market, which is very strange, so perhaps utilities are signaling that we might see lower yields to come,” Gordon added.  Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global, says utilities could still outperform despite sky-high multiples. “We have utilities at really high multiples — I mean, utilities are regulated, they’re slow growers, they’re great payers, they’re not supposed to be at multiples of 21 times,” Sanchez said during the same segment. “And yet that’s where they are, and yet their dividends are still almost 3%, they’re still the third-highest-paying dividend sector in the S&P.” While the utilities sector yields 3%, the 10-year holds at 1.8%. The other high-dividend sectors are REITs and energy. “That basically tells you that there’s actually still going to be some capital that will be attracted to that dividend, especially, to Todd’s point, if rates continue to go low and it will drive investors into high-dividend sectors,” said Sanchez. Gordon adds that American Electric Power and Dominion Energy look like two good candidates to get exposure to the sector. AEP is up 4% this week, while Dominion has climbed more than 1%.

6,IAG Soars as British Airways Owner Scraps Limit on Non-EU Shareholding | Barron's,IAG Soars as British Airways Owner Scraps Limit on Non-EU Shareholding. . . A British Airways plane lands at Heathrow,"    International Consolidated Airlines Group shares took off on Friday after the British Airways owner lifted restrictions on non-EU investors owning the stock. Shares in IAG, which also owns Spanish airline Iberia and Irish carrier Aer Lingus, climbed 6.6% after the company scrapped a limit on non-EU shareholding. The airline group imposed a maximum limit on share ownership in February 2019, as 47.5% of the shares were owned by non-EU investors. EU rules state more than half of an airline’s shares must be owned by investors inside the bloc. IAG said on Friday that 39.5% of the company was now owned by shareholders outside the European Union—leading it to remove the restrictions. The company said it would continue to monitor the level. The issue may resurface later this year once Britain has left the EU, as U.K. investors may no longer count toward the 50% ownership requirement. In a busy month for IAG, Chief Executive Willie Walsh announced he would retire in June after 15 years, while the company has also filed an official complaint to the European Commission over the U.K. government’s bailout of domestic airline Flybe. IAG stock has now climbed 47% in the past six months, having suffered from a record fine following a data breach and a series of pilot strikes. European airlines have enjoyed a good start to 2020, despite surging oil prices at the beginning of the year following the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Oil prices have dropped back and major airlines, including Irish carrier Ryanair and easyJet, are up for the year. The entire sector was also given a lift after Ryanair raised its full-year profit guidance after a strong holiday period. Looking ahead. European airlines have experienced significant turbulence in recent times but 2020 has been smooth flying so far. After a tumultuous 2019 for British Airways, IAG investors will be hoping the share price recovery continues, although Brexit and its potential impact on the industry await on the horizon. Enterprise hardware stocks have been outperforming the market recently, and there should be further gains ahead. That’s the view of Morgan Stanley hardware analyst Katy Huberty, who lifted her price targets and earnings estimates for many stocks across the sector in an extensive research note Wednesday. She also shifted ratings on a number...            ","Jan 17, 2020",https://www.barrons.com/articles/iag-soars-as-british-airways-owner-scraps-limit-on-non-eu-shareholding-51579264006

8,Is British Airways a 15% p.a. compounder for the 2020s? - Undervalued Shares,. A jumbo jet of a research project. Completing my set of three investment opportunities from Britain. The temporary ownership," Image by RickDeacon / Shutterstock.com You'll be surprised to read about British Airways (BA) on my blog. All the more, since this company is not itself listed on the stock market. You need to buy into Madrid-listed International Airlines Group (IAG, ISIN ES0177542018), a holding company that owns 100% of British Airways. The holding company had been formed out of a merger of BA and Iberia, and since then has also acquired Aer Lingus, Vueling, and Level (making it the third largest airline company in Europe). BA makes up the majority of IAG's business. Based on my analysis, IAG could be a share to buy and tuck away for the next ten years. Across the next decade, it could make an average 12% to 15% p.a. for its shareholders. That would be anything but a bad return from a company that has been in business for a century, and the stock of which is a highly liquid blue chip. In my view, IAG stock is one for the retirement portfolio. I am so bullish about it, that I just released one of the most complex research reports I have ever written. I have just summarised my research on IAG in a 108-page report. It's a real humdinger of a document, and it saw me burning a lot of midnight oil during the past few weeks. Some will say that I am mad. However, I believe the target of my research will have been well worth the effort. By making this call, I take a position that is highly contrarian compared to what you can usually read in the mainstream media. Newspapers and TV stations mostly portray BA as a shadow of its former glory. Massive cuts to inflight catering, constant delays at Heathrow, and that costly customer data leak in September 2018. Yada, yada, yada. You know the story. Surely, this would reflect on IAG's stock price? Why, then, is the stock price up 220% over the past ten years? Compare that to Lufthansa, up just 29% since 2010. Or AirFrance/KLM, down 9% over the past decade. True, BA isn't as plush an airline as it once was. I hear you on that one, having been a BA Frequent Flyer myself for nearly two decades. However, something seems to be going right at the newly constituted IAG/BA. Indeed, here are a few facts you are unlikely to be aware","Jan 17, 2020",https://www.undervalued-shares.com/weekly-dispatches/is-british-airways-a-15-p-a-compounder-for-the-2020s/

10,Thai Airlines records steep losses,Thai Airlines records steep losses,"BANGKOK:Reeling from a slew of negative factors, the financial performance of airlines listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) took a nosedive across the board last year. According to the Bangkok Post, this was despite higher foreign tourist arrivals and rosy tourism revenue. Thailand saw a total of 39 million international tourists last year, compared with 38 million in 2018, cementing the nation’s position as a favourite destination among global travellers. Revenue from tourism also soared by 3.7 per cent for the first 11 months of last year compared with 2018. However, this did not register as positive earnings for SET-listed airlines, with all four airlines reporting net profits in the red for the third quarter. Thai International Airways (THAI) recorded the steepest net loss for the first nine months. Despite THAI shares falling by 43.4 per cent last year, THAI president Sumeth Damrongchaitham said such losses were normal for airlines amid fierce competition and price wars to win customers. Asia Aviation, a holding company that owned the majority of Thai AirAsia, also faced difficulties. Due to price wars in the international market and higher expenses related to airport operations and staff costs, the airline’s share price tumbled the most last year, with a 46.7 per cent nosedive. The Postsaid aviation was among the most affected sectors in the stock market, with a sharp decline in share prices based on a streak of losses attributed to heightening downside risks. ‘Higher competition from low-cost airlines and lower tourism growth (compared with double-digit growth tallies in the past) were key factors shaving off profits of the aviation industry last year. Higher oil prices and the prolonged global economic slowdown have kept a lid on the industry’s earnings outlook for this year,’ Sukit Udomsirikul, managing director for research at SCB Securities (SCBS) said. SCBS vice-president Ekpawin Suntarapichard added that higher oil prices will put more pressure on companies operating in the aviation industry. Last year, many low-cost domestic carriers reported losses, with the higher jet fuel tax seen as one of the factors derailing their earnings, reported the National News Bureau of Thailand. The losses led to some airlines cancelling certain domestic routes. The Excise Department held talks with airline representatives and fuel suppliers on the feasibility of reducing jet fuel taxes as a remedy.","Jan 17, 2020",https://www.nst.com.my/world/region/2020/01/557582/thai-airlines-records-steep-losses
11,Extreme greed in the stock market is producing a bad setup as earnings season starts - MarketWatch,MarketWatch Site Logo A link that brings you back to the homepage. .mwA1{fill:#ffffff;} .mwA2{fill:#4db74d;}. Opinion: Extreme greed in the stock,"Earnings are the single best guide in the stock market in the long term. In the short term, sentiment rules. Only 8% of the strong move up in the stock market last year was attributable to earnings. The rest was triggered by the Federal Reserve reversing its policy of raising interest rates, which boosted sentiment, especially among the momo (momentum) crowd. In short, sentiment is driven by fear and greed. The CNN Fear & Greed Index stands at 90, representing extreme greed. Our proprietary sentiment indicator at The Arora Report differs from CNN’s conclusion in that the stock market is not yet at an extreme bullish level; it is approaching the extreme zone. Earnings season is starting. And this level of greed is producing a bad setup. Let’s explore the issue with the help of a chart.

Focus: North American stocks MARKET OUTLOOK We’re seeing a rotation from defensive stocks to more cyclical “value” stocks. However, high-priced growth stocks in sectors like technology have led the market higher again. Even in the face of a steepening yield curve, investors remain in love with “growth-at-any-price” stocks. The overall U.S. market is back to dot-com peak valuation on measures like EV/EBITDA and price-to-sales. Historically from these levels, returns over the next decade are in the single digits or even negative. Buying “beta” might not be the best approach. The highest-risk stocks to own are the most expensive growth stocks, particularly U.S. tech stocks. If we have an economic growth recovery, these stocks are likely to lag more value-oriented sectors. If we roll into a recession (not our base case), growth stocks will get hammered.  We find the most defensive stocks like utilities to be expensive, as are high-priced growth stocks. The very cheapest cyclical sectors like energy and materials appear to be turning the corner and we’re adding to them here. Our highest conviction sectors are where we find decent valuation and decent price trends: financials, industrials and consumer discretionary. TOP PICKS Jason Mann, chief investment officer at EdgeHill Partners, discusse his top picks: Whitecap Resources, Great Canadian Gaming, Linamar. WHITECAP RESOURCES (WCP TSX) Like most energy companies, Whitecap has had a rough few years. With a bit of a cyclical rotation underway and with commodity prices overall a bit more supportive, we’re turning more of our attention to some of the more “deep value” stocks in the market. Whitecap scores well on valuation not just against other energy stocks, but the whole market. They pay a 6.4-per-cent yield which we believe is sustainable and a balance sheet that isn’t stretched. Price momentum is still struggling on a relative basis to non-energy stocks, but it’s improving like for some other Canadian energy companies.","Jan 17, 2020",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/jason-mann-s-top-picks-jan-17-2020-1.1375731
14,The S&P Sectors - Overview and Description of the 11 Sectors,The S&P Sectors. What are the S&P Sectors?. Uses of Breaking Down into Sectors. Quick Summary Points. Overview of the,"The S&P sectors constitute a method of sorting publicly traded companies into 11 sectors and 24 industry groups. Created by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Morgan Stanely Capital International (MSCI), they are also known as the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). S&P sorts companies into sectors based on their primary business activity.      Sector breakdowns help portfolio managers and investors determine the allocation of funds within a portfolio. If an investor wants to create a diversified portfolio, the portfolio should include stocks from a variety of sectors. For smaller investors seeking to create a diversified portfolio, they can easily do by investing in an index exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, if an investor is only interested in investing in, for example, technology or energy-based businesses, they can, of course, confine their investing to only the sectors they are interested in.           The information technology – IT – sector consists of companies that develop or distribute technological items or services, and includes internet companies. Technology products include computers, microprocessors, and operating systems. Example of companies in this sector includes big names like Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corp., and Mastercard Inc. This sector has seen a lot of change in recent years because of the rapid rise in technology-based companies.   Health care consists of medical supply companies, pharmaceutical companies, and scientific-based operations or services that aim to improve the human body or mind. Familiar names include Johnson & Johnson, a medical device and pharmaceutical company that owns Tylenol, and Abiomed, which manufactures medical implant devices. Cannabis companies are a new, but rapidly growing, part of the health care sector. Currently, the more well-known ones include Canopy Growth Corp. and Aurora Cannabis, with market caps of $23 billion and $12 billion, respectively.   The financial sector includes all companies involved in finance, investing, and the movement or storage of money. It includes banks, credit card issuers, credit unions, insurance companies, and mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs). Companies within this sector are usually relatively stable, as many are mature, well-established firms. Banks in this sector include Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Goldman Sachs. Other notable sector names include Berkshire Hathaway, American Express, and Aon plc.   Discretionary consumer products are luxury items or services that are not necessary for survival.

The Dow barely moved to the upside on Friday as a collapse in Boeing (NYSE: BA) weighed heavily on the U.S. stock market. By: Francois Aure | Email | Leave a comment A decent day for the Dow Jones was ruined by a miserable performance from Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock, which faces spiraling costs surrounding the grounding of its 737 MAX jet. Rough macro data gave the stock market more cause for concern. Industrial production, building permits, and Michigan consumer sentiment all missed forecasts. In line with the weak data, it was a cautious day of trade for the three major US stock market indices. The S&P 500 was the marginal winner, eking out a 0.21% gain while the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced less than 0.1%. At last check, the Dow had edged 22.73 points or 0.8% higher to 29,320.21. In the commodity markets, crude oil was up 0.07%, and the price of gold resumed its climb with a 0.67% rally. As the Dow ranges at record highs, investors have been enjoying de-escalating geopolitical risks alongside robust earnings on Wall Street. But the disconnect between macroeconomic fundamentals and the stock market has begun to widen.   Friday’s industrial production and building permit data were worse than expected, and Michigan consumer sentiment suffered its first contraction since November. (At 99.1, the reading is still robust.) In line with their bearish expectations for the U.S. economy, Nordea Research argues that the Dow will have to deal with a resurgence of","Jan 17, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/dow-limps-higher-but-boeings-titanic-737-max-costs-will-shock-investors/

The Dow could make it to 30,000 sooner than expected as several key events help spur on this rally and help markets march higher. By: Laura Hoy | Email | Leave a comment It’s about to be another bumper day for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 as good news continues to buoy investor sentiment. Dow futures ticked upward on Friday morning as investors digested Donald Trump’s back-to-back trade deals. So far this year, the US stock market has been on a tear, leading many to worry about a significant pullback. But heading into the weekend, the Dow is poised to make its way closer to the 30,000 benchmark. Here’s a look at 5 factors that will drive the Dow on Friday. The Dow can’t rally without the help of its top 3 stocks— Boeing (NYSE:BA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH). The way the Dow is weighted means those three stocks account for roughly 21% of the index’s performance. Boeing sits at the top of that pack, making it the Dow’s most important performer. Friday is looking bright for the plane-maker as it continues to work toward getting the MAX back into the skies. Investors are willing to take any crumb of information as good news as long as it signals progress— and that’s exactly what we saw on Thursday when Boeing stock picked up 1% on news that Southwest was taking the plane off its roster through June.  While that might sound like bad news, investors assuming that","Jan 17, 2020",https://www.ccn.com/5-reasons-dow-will-finish-the-week-on-an-incredible-high/
18,13 Super Small-Cap Stocks to Buy for 2020 and Beyond,S&P 500. Dow 30. Nasdaq. Russell 2000. Crude Oil. Gold. Silver. EUR/USD. 10-Yr Bond. GBP/USD. USD/JPY. BTC-USD. CMC Crypto 200.," Getty Images Small-cap stocks lagged the S&P 500 by a wide margin last year. However, strategists say these smaller companies are set to catch up (and more) in 2020. ""We see three favorable factors in place for small-cap stocks: a slow economy, an accommodative Fed, and the calendar, all of which add up to positive prospects for this asset class,"" asset manager Legg Mason says. To get an idea of which small-cap stocks are set to break away from the pack, we scoured the S&P SmallCap 600 Index - which includes stocks worth between $450 million and $2.1 billion at the time they enter the index - looking for names with an average broker recommendation of Buy or Strong Buy. Why? Small caps can be a risky lot given their often narrow businesses and access to capital - but a bullish consensus from the pros is at least a signal that those risks might be smaller compared to their peers, and that the potential upside is worth it. S&P Global Market Intelligence surveys analysts' stock ratings and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals Strong Buy and 5.0 means Strong Sell. Any score of 2.0 or lower means that analysts, on average, rate the stock a Buy. The closer the score gets to 1.0, the stronger the Buy call. We further culled that pool by considering only stocks with market values of at least $1 billion and a minimum of five Strong Buy recommendations. Lastly, we dug into research, fundamentals and headlines. The result is a list of 13 promising small-cap stocks to buy for 2020. Getty Images Market value: $2.3 billion Dividend yield: N/A Analysts' average recommendation: 1.55 NMI Holdings (NMIH, $33.15) - parent of mortgage company National MI - is on a tear, and analysts expect more to come. The mortgage insurance company is coasting on favorable monetary policy and a rock-solid labor market. ""Against a favorable backdrop of lower interest rates and a low unemployment rate, it was not surprising that the company also posted very solid results for (the most recent quarter),"" say analysts at BTIG, which rates shares at Buy. ""All the metrics the company posted during the quarter were impressive.""                               ","Jan 17, 2020",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-super-small-cap-stocks-184047988.html
