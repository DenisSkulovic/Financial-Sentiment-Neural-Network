0,Thomas Cook Collapses as Rival Tui and Low-Cost Airline Stocks Jump | Barron's,Travel Giant Thomas Cook Collapsed and Now Rival Tui and Low-Cost Airline Stocks Are Gaining. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. The Barron's Daily.,"  A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.  Travel operator Tui and low-cost airline stocks soared on Monday after Thomas Cook, Britain’s oldest travel agent, collapsed. The 178-year-old firm failed to secure the further £200 million needed to survive over the weekend, leaving 150,000 British holidaymakers stranded abroad. The back story. The tour operator agreed a £900 million rescue deal with Chinese investor Fosun last month, which would have written off £1.7 billion in debt. However, on Friday Thomas Cook said it needed an additional £200 million following a demand from its banks. The company had said it was in talks with its banks and bondholders as well as its largest shareholder Fosun. Britain’s oldest travel agent, founded in 1841, has faced mounting headwinds as online holiday booking companies have grown in popularity, and low-cost airlines provide tough competition. Last year’s summer heat wave in Europe, and high temperatures again this year, led to a fall in holiday demand. The company reported a £1.5 billion ($1.75 billion) loss in the first half of the financial year, including a £1.1 billion loss following its decision to write down the value of My Travel, which it merged with in 2007. It predicted further headwinds and claimed that Brexit had led to customers delaying holiday plans. What’s new. Thomas Cook confirmed on Monday that it had entered compulsory liquidation after failing to secure a further £200 million over the weekend. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser, who has taken home more than £8 million in remuneration since taking over in 2014, said it was a “matter of profound regret.” The government-backed Civil Aviation Authority has stepped in to undertake an “emergency operation” to repatriate an estimated 150,000 Brits stranded abroad. Package holiday rival Tui’s stock soared 7.5%, despite a small number of holidays with flights booked on Thomas Cook’s airline being affected. Low-cost airlines also took off on Monday, with easyJet climbing 3.4% and Ryanair lifting 1.1% after Thomas Cook’s final passenger flight came into land for the final time. Dart Group, a pick from Eagle Capital’s Meryl Witmer at this year’s Barron’s Roundtable
, has gained 7.1%.  Moving forward. Intense competition has squeezed airlines and travel operators in recent years, and Thomas Cook’s collapse will alleviate overcapacity in the industry. However, greater problems face the sector, including falling","Sep 23, 2019",https://www.barrons.com/articles/thomas-cook-collapses-sending-rival-tui-and-low-cost-airlines-higher-51569238885

RECOVERY WITH THE FT Bryce Elder ● Tui led the FTSE 100 gainers as the collapse of Thomas Cook raised hopes of tighter package holiday capacity and improved pricing. Tui and Thomas Cook overlap in key markets including the UK, Germany and the Nordics, said Barclays. It forecast that if Tui picked up £2bn of lost Thomas Cook revenue it would be worth an extra 4 per cent to group trading profit. “However, whilst the benefit to Tui could be material, the issues TCG has faced only serve to highlight how challenged the tour operating business is from a structural perspective. So while Tui may benefit, investors are unlikely to immediately become fully comfortable owning Tui, particularly given the immediate uncertainties ahead.” ● On The Beach edged higher even after cautioning that it would book the cost of covering Thomas Cook’s cancelled flights as a one-off exceptional, as well as losing margin on cancelled bookings. The costs could be up to £7m, or a fifth of adjusted annual pre-tax profit, analysts said. Historically, between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of OTB bookings have included a Thomas Cook flight, according to Liberum. Short-term disruption was inevitable but flight schedules should have evened out by the summer 2020 season and “with the 2.5m former Thomas Cook passengers up for grabs, this should then become a major tailwind,” it said. “Hence, this event will likely change the shape of 2020 but overall could end up neutral for the year ahead.” ● EasyJet and Ryanair led gains among the airline stocks. Thomas Cook accounted for about 1.5 per cent of European short-haul capacity from the UK in the winter, rising to about 3 per cent in the summer, analysts said. Its failure follows on the heels of French airlines Aigle Azur and XL Airways that ceased trading. “This autumn shake-out is earlier than usual (late October/November tends to be the airline liquidity low point). While distressing news for passengers and holidaymakers, longer-term an earlier shake-out likely leads to less risk of irrational fare pricing (cash flow raising rather than profit making) affecting this winter . . . For easyJet we think this does suggest a more rational winter is ahead, but beyond that, how [airport landing] slots and capacity is recycled back into the market will be key. History here suggests that capacity will not disappear, but return in just a slightly","Sep 23, 2019",https://www.ft.com/content/b7d113fe-dde1-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59
2,These stocks could profit from the collapse of the package-holiday provider Thomas Cook - MarketWatch,MarketWatch Site Logo A link that brings you back to the homepage. .mwA1{fill:#ffffff;} .mwA2{fill:#4db74d;}. MarketWatch First Take. Opinion: These stocks,"Thomas Cook’s rivals soared after Britain’s oldest travel agent collapsed Monday, but the slow death of the package holiday could see alternative providers having the last laugh. Tui TUI, -0.43% and Jet2 owner Dart Group UK:DTG made strong gains, but tour operators could face turbulent times ahead as the industry faces mounting headwinds. Thomas Cook UK:TCG began in 1841 with an 11-mile railway trip taking 500 temperance-society members from Leicester, England, to a teetotal rally in Loughborough. After 178 years of organizing travel, the final flight came in for a Monday-morning landing at Manchester Airport. Poor decisions in the face of rising online retailers, a £1.7 billion debt pile — roughly $2.1 billion — along with summer heat waves and increased competition contributed to the company’s downfall. The growing popularity of “staycations” due to warmer weather in the U.K. and as a cheaper alternative to going abroad on vacation has also affected demand. But the sudden collapse of Thomas Cook may also signify that the end is nigh for the package holiday. Already, rival Monarch went bust in 2017 after having moved away from its once-successful packages to focus on flight-only deals. Rise of online holiday retailers Holidaymakers have warmed to the flexibility offered by an increasing variety of online companies, including Expedia EXPE, +0.85% and Booking.com BKNG, -0.65% in recent years. Platforms such as Airbnb as well as apps for car hire and cheaper flights have enabled customers to build their own holidays. Leading online holiday firm On the Beach OTB, +0.14% could benefit from the trend away from package tours. The company, which focuses on short-haul beach holidays, allows customers to control all elements of a trip, including flights, hotels and other services. Shares have risen 21% so far this year, and despite warning of a one-off cost in helping its customers who had booked with Thomas Cook, the stock could climb higher as it looks to grow sales from longer-haul holidays. A smaller trend toward specialist holidays has also emerged in recent years, with eco-friendly vacations and adventure holidays increasingly popular. Another is the niche area of political trips. Low-cost airline boost With industry giants such as Monarch and Thomas Cook out of the way, the rise of low-cost airlines shows no sign of slowing down. Shares of Ryanair RY4C, +0.46% RYA, +0.90% and easyJet EZJ, -3.23% both jumped on Monday.

3,Did Spirit Airlines and American Airlines Deserve Monday's Analyst Downgrades? | The Motley Fool,Did Spirit Airlines and American Airlines Deserve Monday's Analyst Downgrades?. Embattled airlines American Airlines and Spirit Airlines received more analyst,"   Shares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) moved lower on Monday after getting negative reviews from Wall Street analysts. Andrew Didora of Bank of America downgraded shares of both airlines due to his projection that industry unit revenue trends are poised to deteriorate. To add insult to injury, Spirit Airlines stock was also downgraded by analyst Jack Atkins of Stephens. Spirit Airlines and American Airlines have certainly faced plenty of setbacks this year. And while American Airlines isn't doomed, it's reasonable for analysts to take a cautious attitude toward the company. By contrast, Spirit Airlines' troubles are not as bad as they seem. SPIRIT AIRLINES IS NOT IN AS MUCH TROUBLE AS IT MAY APPEAR. IMAGE SOURCE: SPIRIT AIRLINES. In his recent report, Bank of America's Didora noted that the return of the Boeing 737 MAX -- which will likely occur in late 2019 or early 2020 -- will drive a sharp uptick in U.S. airline industry capacity growth in 2020. He projects that domestic capacity will increase nearly 6% next year. Meanwhile, demand growth appears to be slowing. As a result, airlines could face significant unit revenue pressure as industry capacity growth accelerates. In this context, Didora is advising investors to avoid shares of airlines that face cost pressures. He observed that American Airlines has numerous labor contracts up for renewal soon, which could lead to big wage increases or increased labor strife. He also pointed to Spirit Airlines CFO Scott Haralson's comment in late July that nonfuel unit costs would likely be flat or up slightly in 2020, despite very easy year-over-year comparisons. Both American and Spirit have significant route network overlap with top 737 MAX customer Southwest Airlines. As a result, Didora believes they will face a double whammy of higher unit costs and weak unit revenue next year. That's why he downgraded American Airlines stock to neutral, with a $31 price target, although that's still above the stock's Friday closing price of $27.99. Didora cut his rating on Spirit Airlines to underperform (the equivalent of sell) and reduced his price target to $39. The stock closed at $38.03 on Friday. Analysts at Stephens were slightly more generous but agree that Spirit Airlines' business is facing significant near-term headwinds. They cut the stock's rating to equal-weight (the equivalent of hold) and slashed their price target to $45 from $55. American Airlines has","Sep 24, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/09/24/did-spirit-airlines-and-american-airlines-deserve.aspx

The 178-year-old U.K. company filed for insolvency early Monday after eleventh-hour fund-raising talks with investors led by China’s Fosun Tourism Group failed. The move saw all bookings, flights and package tours canceled, sparking online panic for travelers. In what it called the “largest repatriation in peacetime history,” the government said it would work to return travellers over the next two weeks free of cost. The company is the highest-profile casualty of a decades-long shift in the travel business. The rise of discount airlines and online booking platforms has encouraged sun-starved Europeans to spurn package-tour operators and arrange their own trips, while the highly seasonal industry has suffered shocks ranging from terrorism to political turmoil. Trading in Thomas Cook’s stock was suspended in London and its euro bonds plunged 72 per cent. Shares of German rival TUI AG rose as much as 11 per cent, while British Airways parent IAG, Easyjet Plc and Ryanair Holdings Plc got a boost from the prospect of flying home stranded passengers at the U.K. government’s expense, as well as increased bookings down the road. Condor, Thomas Cook’s German airline, said it will keep operating flights and has applied for a bridge loan from the German government. The company’s German tour operating arm said it’s sounding out “final options” and warned that","Sep 23, 2019",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/thomas-cook-files-for-bankruptcy-after-bailout-talks-fail-1.1320147

13,Is Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Excessively Paying Its CEO? - Simply Wall St News,Is Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Excessively Paying Its CEO?. How Does Gary Kelly's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?. Is,"Gary Kelly has been the CEO of Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) since 2004. This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other large companies. After that, we will consider the growth in the business. And finally - as a second measure of performance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines According to our data, Southwest Airlines Co. has a market capitalization of US$29b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$7.7m over the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$750k. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations over US$8.0b and the median CEO total compensation was US$11m. There aren't very many mega-cap companies, so we had to take a wide range to get a meaningful comparison figure. This would give shareholders a good impression of the company, since most large companies pay more, leaving less for shareholders. Though positive, it's important we delve into the performance of the actual business. It could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future. You can see, below, how CEO compensation at Southwest Airlines has changed over time. On average over the last three years, Southwest Airlines Co. has grown earnings per share (EPS) by 13% each year (using a line of best fit). In the last year, its revenue is up 5.1%. This shows that the company has improved itself over the last few years. Good news for shareholders. It's good to see a bit of revenue growth, as this suggests the business is able to grow sustainably. I think that the total shareholder return of 51%, over three years, would leave most Southwest Airlines Co. shareholders smiling. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.  It appears that Southwest Airlines Co. remunerates its CEO below most large companies. Considering the underlying business is growing earnings, this would suggest the pay is modest. And given most shareholders are probably very happy with","Sep 23, 2019",https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-luv/southwest-airlines/news/is-southwest-airlines-co-nyseluv-excessively-paying-its-ceo

15,Is BCE (TSX:BCE) a Good Investment? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Is BCE (TSX:BCE) a Good Investment?. The Liberals want to lower your,"      Demetris Afxentiou | September 24, 2019 | More on: BCE BCE Both new and seasoned investors alike know the importance of adding one or more defensive investments. Those defensive investments can provide years of solid growth and income-earning potential without having to be too concerned with market volatility. BCE (TSX:BCE)(NYSE:BCE) is a long-time investment favourite among defensive investors, and for good reason. From the massive BCE empire that blankets Canadians with everything from wireless service to professional sports teams to over a century of uninterrupted dividend payouts, there’s plenty to love about adding BCE to your portfolio. That love is contingent, however, on focusing on the long-term horizon rather than any short-term noise. Canada’s Big Three telecoms finally made an appearance in the ongoing federal election campaign. This past weekend, Justin Trudeau offered the latest carrot stick to investors in the form of a 25% reduction in cell phone bills over the next two years. That reduction was based on the assumption that with increased competition from MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators), prices would ultimately come down. The PM even hinted that if, after two years, prices still didn’t come down, there would be other tools at their disposal, such as lowering access rates and expanding CRTC powers to impact prices. We already have some of the most expensive cell plans in the world, particularly when compared to other developed countries in Europe or even to the U.S. Unfortunately, that statistic doesn’t appear to be changing anytime soon. Industry pundits don’t see the advent of new MVNOs providing enough pressure on the Big Three to lower wireless bills, and a new fourth national player is still operating in limited coverage markets. For investors, this ultimately means more of the status quo, which isn’t all that bad. Nobody is expecting BCE’s share price to double anytime soon. The fact that the BCE empire is as large as it is lends itself to a more conservative approach to growth. In the same vein, any changes to Canada’s wireless market are years away at best, and any new competitor to the market faces an uphill battle to establish and build the requisite infrastructure needed to compete with BCE. Investors contemplating buying into BCE should take a look at the appetizing quarterly dividend that the company offers. The current yield hovers around 4.94%, and BCE has provided investors","Sep 24, 2019",https://www.fool.ca/2019/09/24/is-bce-tsxbce-a-good-investment/

USD/JPY.,"                                                   NEW YORK (AP) — The words were by Mary Oliver, the emotions were Hillary Rodham Clinton's and others who came to pay tribute. The former secretary of state and presidential candidate was among the readers Monday night honoring the beloved, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, who died in January at age 83. Speaking before hundreds at Manhattan's 92nd Street Y, Clinton and such friends of Oliver as Maria Shriver and John Waters all praised the poet's non-conforming spirit and profound bond with the natural world. They told stories and joked over who would get to read which poem, choosing from ""The Journey,"" ''Don't Hesitate"" and other Oliver favorites.
