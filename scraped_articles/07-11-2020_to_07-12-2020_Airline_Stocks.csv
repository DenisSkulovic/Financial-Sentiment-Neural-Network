0,United Airlines Has a Huge Warning for Airlines | The Motley Fool,United Airlines Has a Huge Warning for Airlines. Booking activity slowed significantly beginning a couple of weeks ago in response,"   Shares of most major U.S. airlines surged in the last half of May and the first week of June, as investors became optimistic about the potential for a V-shaped recovery in air travel demand. This belief wasn't totally unfounded. The number of people passing through TSA checkpoints increased rapidly during May and June, after bottoming out in mid-April. However, the strong rebound of the past few months isn't going to continue. Earlier this week, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) showed investors convincing evidence that the nascent recovery in air travel demand is already running out of steam. IMAGE SOURCE: UNITED AIRLINES. On many days in mid-April, fewer than 100,000 passengers passed through TSA checkpoints -- down about 96% year over year. However, air travel activity ramped up steadily during May and June. On May 20, throughput at TSA checkpoints surpassed 10% of 2019 levels for the first time since late March. By June 14, throughput exceeded 20% of year-ago levels. And on July 2 (the Thursday before the Independence Day long weekend), the TSA screened 764,761 passengers, or 36.6% of the year-earlier figure. Many airlines tried to capitalize on the improving demand trends by restoring numerous flights to their summer schedules that they had cut during April and May. As of a few weeks ago, discounters Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Travel both planned to operate more than 85% of their July 2019 capacity this month. The legacy carriers have been a little more cautious, as they rely more on business travel and long-haul international flights, but they have still significantly increased flight volumes since May. There was always a risk that the air travel recovery would lose steam in the fall, when leisure travel demand tends to be seasonally weaker. However, demand appears to be fizzling out even earlier, as the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened considerably in recent weeks. During the first two weeks of June, about 22,000 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the U.S. on a typical day, according to The New York Times. For comparison, the U.S. has averaged more than 50,000 new cases per day over the past week. Additionally, the COVID-19 death rate is starting to increase again. Unsurprisingly, the uptick in cases is denting air travel demand. TSA throughput has continued rising in recent days (albeit more slowly than last month), but United Airlines revealed on Tuesday that airline industry","Jul 11, 2020",https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/11/united-airlines-has-a-huge-warning-for-airlines.aspx

Modern Value Investing with Sven Carlin. Top","19 min  Many have been attracted by Airline stocks recently, but to get exposure to the travel growth mega trend, perhaps it is better to look at Airport stocks. Airport stocks are better than airline stocks because some airports offer a moat, something that no airline offers.
Plus, airport stocks are cheap as airport stock prices fell in the same way as airline stocks. Given that you can own an airport for the next 100 years, get the dividend and exposure to growth that is expected to be at 4.5% per year over the next 20 years, it might be interesting to get exposure now when airports stocks are down due to the covid-19 interruption.

2,Air China | South China Morning Post,,"                                                                        TOPIC  The future of Boeing’s 737 MAX in China remains unclear, even as the troubled passenger jet is approved to return to the skies in the US and Europe.  The promising outlook for a Covid-19 vaccine has given stock analysts a dose of optimism about beaten-down Chinese airlines and airport operators.  The number of air passengers reached 50.32 million in October, 88 per cent of the level a year earlier, as frustrated travellers stuck at home for months during lockdown took to the skies during the ‘golden week’ holiday.  The resumption in travel underscores how life in China, the first major global economy to emerge from coronavirus lockdowns, is almost back to the pre-outbreak levels.  Global airlines have been walloped by the coronavirus pandemic, as governments imposed unprecedented border restrictions and people became more reluctant to travel and passenger traffic is not expected to recover before 2024, the International Air Transport Association said.  Passenger numbers for Air China, China Eastern and China Southern rose about 25 per cent month on month in July as travel within the mainland picked up.  The gradual resumption in air service, even as China and the US are headed in opposite directions in their coronavirus cases, offers the first breather for a global aviation industry poised for a 50 per cent decline in 2020 sales, according to a June forecast by the International Air Travel Association (Iata).  Discount to buy new shares at HK$4.68 narrowed to 18 per cent as Cathay Pacific’s share price continued to slide since the rescue plan was announced in June.  Cathay Pacific may have won the approval for its HK$39 billion rescue plan.

3,Why Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Plunged 29% - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Why Air Canada (TSX:AC) Stock Plunged 29%. Understand what’s happening. Bet on,"      Ryan Vanzo | July 12, 2020 | More on: AC Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock is a strong sell. Or at least that’s what one analyst thinks. “The aviation industry has been decimated,” says aviation expert Phyl Durdey. “I’ve heard from a couple of sources that Air Canada is flying a 787 with 20 people onboard. You can’t make money with that,” Durdey warns. But many investors view the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to buy into airline stocks at bargain prices. At the start of the year, AC stock was above $50. Now, it trades at just $16. For a while, investors were smelling a rebound. In the first week of June, shares spiked nearly 40%. Recent weeks have brought more pain, with shares falling 29%. Before you make a bet on Air Canada, make sure you know what you’re betting on. If you want to take a bet on struggling airline stocks, just know this: no one knows what’s going to happen. The coronavirus pandemic is simply unprecedented. Let’s hear what some CEOs have to say. “We could never have predicted how quickly the coronavirus pandemic would upend our plans as demand for near-term air travel dropped to almost 0 in a matter of weeks,” says Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian. “We are realistic that the timing and shape of revenue recovery are uncertain and are prepared that it could take up to two to three years to return to a new level of normal, which could still be lower than 2019 revenue base.” This prediction aligns with Air Canada’s management team, which expects the downturn to last for at least two to three years. Notably, Boeing and Airbus see challenges existing for up to five additional years. It’s a complete guess at this point. “It’s a challenge bigger than anything we’ve ever faced as far as obviously has had an impact on the global but probably no industry as much as the airline industry,” says Doug Parker, CEO of American Airlines. “We expected to average $70 million a day in cash burn from the second quarter. And we expected that number to decline to approximately $50 million per day by the month of June.” This statement is less controversial. Despite a miracle, almost every airline will be pushed to the financial limit in 2020.

6,Airline shares: How I wish that they could fly,Airline shares: How I wish that they could fly. . Sponsored Articles. Tuck into a good book. New gambling laws,"At Warren Buffett’s annual shareholder gathering on May 2, which took place via video conferencing rather than as a shoulder rubbing of the faithful, he confessed to being “wrong to invest in the airline industry”. His investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, had sold its entire stock of airline shares, worth more than four billion US dollars in April ‒ the time of divestment. This included 10 per cent of American Airlines, 11 per cent of Delta, 10 per cent of Southwest and nine per cent of United Airlines. He justified this radical step with having doubts about the growth prospects of the business. Many of Buffett’s critics saw this as yet another sign that the old man, by any account the world’s most successful investor, has lost his golden touch. With hindsight, many of Berkshire’s investments are not quite fit for America post-Corona. Stakes in banks, oil companies, railways and ageing consumer brands like Kraft look now increasingly unsuitable for a fragile future, a future burdened with hesitant consumption, trade conflict, environmental degradation and an insurmountable load of debt. Cautious for too long towards e-commerce and the tech industry, Berkshire’s shares have underperformed the S&P stock index for quite a while now. In the first three months of 2020 its investment losses accumulated to $50 billion. Financial pundits calculated gleefully that if Buffett had sold his airline shares just a month later, he could have cut his exit losses by $2.7 billion. They also criticise Berkshire’s ever growing cash pile, which now amounts to almost $140 billion. What good may come out of such vast reserves if they cannot be put to profitable use in new investments? From its nadir in March to a recent peak in June the American stock market has gained almost 50 per cent. How is it possible that the ‘Sage of Oklahoma’ was all the while sitting put on his towering cash stack doing nothing? I’d like to argue that the pundits are wrong, and Buffet is right. While it is ‘difficult to predict, especially the future’, investment decisions necessitate permanent judgements on things to come. This can only happen in a rational way when based on all known or knowable facts. The eventual outcome of such judgements can never disprove or justify a decision: hindsight makes us never right or wrong, only the misreading of information available at the time does.
