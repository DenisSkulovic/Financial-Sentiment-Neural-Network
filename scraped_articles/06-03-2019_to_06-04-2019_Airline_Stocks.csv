0,Why American Airlines Stock Could Bounce Back From Its Recent 52-Week Low | The Motley Fool,Why American Airlines Stock Could Bounce Back From Its Recent 52-Week Low. Investors may be underestimating the tailwinds that could,"   Shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) plunged to a new 52-week low last week as rising trade tensions and fears of a global economic slowdown roiled the stock market. Its Friday closing price of $27.23 was less than six times American Airlines' projected 2019 earnings.  Other than a brief period of panic in mid-2016 following the U.K.'s vote in favor of Brexit, American Airlines stock hadn't fallen below $30 since shortly after its late-2013 merger with US Airways.  AMERICAN AIRLINES STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS. To be sure, American Airlines faces serious threats, including stubbornly high costs; massive debt, pension, and lease liabilities; and continuing labor unrest. Nevertheless, investors may be underestimating the ability of the world's largest airline to bounce back from its current challenges. Slowing economic growth and rising tariffs threaten the profits of  global businesses. Lower profits could, in turn, encourage companies to save money by cutting back on discretionary business travel. The weakening of international trade relationships could have a particularly large impact on long-haul international travel. All of this explains why investors have sent the shares of global airlines like American Airlines lower recently. That said, American Airlines has a smaller footprint in China -- and Asia more broadly -- than its two main rivals, particularly after the cutbacks it implemented last year. Furthermore, American gets 73% of its passenger revenue from the domestic market, compared to 71% for Delta Air Lines and about 62% for United Continental. Thus, an extended trade war with China might not hurt American Airlines as much as its competitors. Meanwhile, trade tensions and fears of an economic slowdown have sent oil prices tumbling. Crude prices have fallen by more than $10 per barrel since late April -- with most of that drop coming in the last two weeks -- following sharp increases in the first several months of 2019. A $650 million increase in the carrier's full-year fuel cost estimate was one big factor driving American Airlines' April guidance cut. (The company reduced its EPS forecast from a $5.50 to $7.50 range to a $4 to $6 range at that time.) Yet jet fuel prices are now slightly lower than when it made its initial forecast in late January. That could offset some deterioration in the revenue environment. Of course, there's no guarantee that fuel cost savings will outweigh the impact of a slowdown","Jun 3, 2019",https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/03/why-american-airlines-stock-could-bounce-back-from.aspx
1,Why American Airlines Stock Dropped 20% in May | The Motley Fool,Why American Airlines Stock Dropped 20% in May. Investors are still wrestling with the short-term implications of the 737 MAX,"   Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) lost 20.3% in value last month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company announced a mixed first-quarter earnings report in late April, with earnings exceeding analysts' expectations but revenue coming in slightly below estimates.  American Airlines stock initially rebounded on the news, but in early May, Boeing stock was downgraded by one analyst, which had a spillover effect to the rest of the airline industry. The downgrade was based on a survey conducted by the analyst revealing that passengers plan to choose flights based on the type of aircraft after the recent crashes involving the new Boeing 737 MAX. The survey presents an additional obstacle the airlines have to deal with in the short term, on top of rising fuel costs. After the Boeing downgrade, airline stocks across the board began a hard sell-off that continued through the end of May. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The grounding of the 737 MAX has been a disruption to flight schedules for the major airlines in recent months. However, airline investors had brushed off the impact of the recent flight cancellations, expecting that the 737 MAX would start flying again soon, which would get the major airlines back to normal performance.  However, if more passengers avoid the 737 MAX altogether, that means the aircraft has totally lost the trust of passengers -- and that presents an additional headwind to the airlines in the short term that investors hadn't counted on. Since Wall Street typically hates uncertainty, it's not surprising that airline stocks sold off last month. American Airlines says that 2% of its total capacity is impacted each day this summer by the grounding of the 737 MAX. This represents a tiny percentage of American's fleet, but management pointed out that the company is still footing the bill to operate the entire fleet. As a result, the company expects the cancellations to cut about $350 million off pre-tax earnings this year.  Still, management expects full-year earnings to be up approximately 10% compared to 2018, while analysts expect revenue to increase by 4.1% this year.  Even with the recent challenges, CEO Doug Parker is optimistic about the long term: ""As we look forward to 2020 and beyond, we anticipate that our free cash flow production will increase significantly as our historic fleet replacement program winds down.

Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker purchased 50,000 shares on the open market for $1.4 million, while President Robert Isom bought 15,000 for $416,250, according to regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “These share purchases are not part of our compensation package. They were purchased solely because of the value we see in American today and over time,” the executives said in a letter to American employees, which did not include the number of shares bought or at what price. Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr and three other executives bought 5,000 shares each for about $138,800, the filings showed. American, which has been hurt by the worldwide grounding of Boeing Co’s 737 MAX planes, has been among the worst performing stocks this year in the airline industry. The company’s shares have fallen more than 9 percent so far in 2019, compared with an 8.8% rise in rival Delta Air Lines Inc’s and 3.8% fall in United Continental Holding Inc’s. The broader Dow Jones Transport Average index has risen about 10% during the same period.

What's the opportunity in American Airlines Group?. What does the,"Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card! Let's talk about the popular American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of $36.25 and falling to the lows of $27.2. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether American Airlines Group's current trading price of $27.2 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at American Airlines Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my relative valuation model. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 8.68x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 10.43x, which means if you buy American Airlines Group today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that American Airlines Group should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since American Airlines Group’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. American Airlines Group’s earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 81%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.

6,"FANG stocks just lost nearly $130 billion, chart points to more pain","FANG stocks just lost nearly $130 billion in market cap, and chart points to more pain. MORE IN TRADING NATION.","Fears of increased government scrutiny just crushed FANG stocks. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet tanked Monday, shedding nearly $130 billion in market cap collectively. Those losses sent Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet into a bear market, having dropped at least 20% from recent records. The drop came on the first trading day after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department is readying an antitrust investigation against Google over its search practices and other issues. Alphabet declined to comment. The NYSE Fang+ index, which tracks the big tech companies and a handful of other stocks, could be in for more pain, says Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer. “As a group, this particular index has not fared well. If you look at the NYSE Fang+ index -- it’s an equal weighted composite of 10 related names, it’s the four we know plus stocks like Tesla and Alibaba are in there as well -- it’s trading at the same level it first traded at back in December of 2017,” Wald said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Monday. “It’s been a very tough market for this index in what’s really been a better environment for high growth in general.” The NYSE Fang+ index tumbled 4% on Monday, and remains just 1% higher for the year. By comparison, high-growth sectors including software, consumer discretionary and communication services have rallied by at least 10%.  “For this particular index, I can say that there’s really no signs that this underperformance is abating, and for exposure we prefer software and services. We think that’s going to be the part of high growth that outperforms,” said Wald. Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global, says just the threat of increased regulatory oversight could stymie the FANG trade for some time. “These companies will be very, very mired in the process of being scrutinized,” Sanchez said during the same segment. “They could actually keep these companies so involved in this process over the next two years that they won’t be able to effectively run and do the things that growth companies do.” The degree of oversight could mirror the intense antitrust scrutiny given to Microsoft during the 1990s, says Sanchez. The U.S. government accused Microsoft of illegally maintaining a monopoly, a case it won in a 2000 ruling. “The market response is appropriate given the fact that everybody saw what happened to Microsoft, they had to","Jun 4, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/04/fang-stocks-just-lost-nearly-130-billion-chart-points-to-more-pain.html

CNBC Newsletters","Tech stocks rebounded hard on Tuesday, though the FANG names remain sharply off their records. Facebook has been the worst hit, steeped in a bear market having fallen 23% from its all-time highs, while Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet have dropped at least 16%. One of those names could be primed for a major comeback, says Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com. “Netflix has been in a bit of a consolidation, but relative to the broader market, it’s showing some pretty good relative strength here,” Gordon told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “So should the market begin to stabilize, Netflix might be able to make a push up here.” The 200-day moving average appears to be holding as support, Gordon explained. Netflix came close to touching that level in February, March and April but bounced each time. It briefly broke below it during Monday’s session but has since recouped those losses. A longer-term look at the charts also suggest upside here, says Gordon. Netflix is “nowhere near the 200-week moving average, but it’s the same kind of situation. We’re right down in the 50-week moving average, we held it as support, buyers are starting to come in here,” he said. “Technical support combined with the relative strength of Netflix compared to the Nasdaq … makes sense for a trade on the upside for me.” Gordon is buying the July 19 expiration 370 call and selling the 380 call for $3.55. This is a bullish bet that shares of Netflix will rally as high as $380 by July expiration. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

has been a stellar performer in many portfolios and has consistently provided income and capital appreciation to investors over the years. After the stock broke through the psychological $100 barrier in 2013, its price has since quadrupled in value over the last 6 years. Whether the stock’s future performance can match its notable ascent will depend in large part on the global economy and the demand for Boeing’s many products. If you think it’s right for your portfolio, read on to learn how to buy Boeing stock today. Contents Boeing is the second-largest defense contractor in the United States and the largest aerospace company. It’s also a major manufacturer of military and commercial aircraft, helicopters and missiles. The company’s history begins with the founding of Aero Products Company by William “Bill” Boeing in 1916. The company was started shortly after Boeing and a U.S. Navy officer, Conrad Westervelt, had developed a single-engine seaplane, which they named the “B&W.” In 1929, the company changed its name to United Aircraft and Transport Corporation after the acquisitions of Sikorsky Aviation, engine maker Pratt & Whitney, Chance Vought, Avion (that later became Northrop Aircraft), aircraft and propeller manufacturer Hamilton Metalplane and Stearman Aircraft. Boeing’s airline division consolidated 4 smaller airlines into United Airlines in 1931. The Air Mail Act of 1934 required that air transport businesses be separated from airplane manufacturing businesses, which led to the breakup of United Aircraft and Transport. The breakup gave birth to three companies: the Boeing Airplane Company, United Aircraft Corp. which later became United Technologies and United Airlines, which later became one of the largest airline stocks. More recently, the company lost -2.53% in 2014. That was Boeing’s only down year since the 2008 global financial crisis. Boeing has seen a steady stream of civil and defense business and has acquired or partnered with several companies. An example was its 2017 acquisition of Aurora Flight Sciences, which will expand Boeing’s capabilities in long-flight electric powered aircraft. Other recent ventures included a partnership with Safran to manufacture and service auxiliary power units (APUs).

As pandemic deepens, Texas’ unemployment rate rises to 8.1% in November,","  BUSINESSLOCAL COMPANIES By Bloomberg Wire 6:27 PM on Jun 4, 2019 CDT American Airlines Group Inc.'s top six executives purchased an extra 85,000 shares, paying a combined $2.37 million after the company posted this year's biggest drop among major U.S. carriers. Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker paid $1.4 million for 50,000 shares, while President Robert Isom bought 15,000 at a cost of $416,250, according to regulatory filings Tuesday. The four remaining executives, including Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr, took 5,000 each for as much as $138,800.   ""These share purchases are not part of our compensation package,"" the executives said in a message to employees. ""They were purchased solely because of the value we see in American today and over time."" The purchases were the first such coordinated action by American's top executives, said spokesman Matt Miller. Parker chose in 2015 to give up the cash portion of his compensation and be paid only in stock. The shares have dropped 43% since then, and the CEO has repeatedly said American is undervalued. His latest open-market purchase was the biggest for an insider at the Fort Worth-based carrier in at least 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares surged 7.1% to $29.12 at the close in New York, the biggest gain in five months. That pared this year's loss to 9.3%, which is still the worst on a Standard & Poor's index of the five largest U.S. carriers. American is among U.S. carriers being affected by the grounding of Boeing Co.'s 737 Max, with 24 of the aircraft that have been parked since March.

By CCN.com: The salad days of the FANG stocks are over. The stock market is insanely overvalued, and those that led the charge will die on the hill. All of the FANG stocks in the stock market, with the possible exception of Alphabet aka Google stock, are overvalued. At some point, something unexpected always lurches out of the darkness to take valuations down.   This time, it’s the DOJ antitrust probe, although that comes on top of privacy and censorship concerns. There’s good news is that as the stock market dumps the FANG stocks, investors will look for stocks that can provide outsized returns. That will take them to CURO Group Holdings (NASDAQ:CURO).

By: Francois Aure | Email | Leave a comment By CCN.com: If you thought things couldn’t get any worse for Boeing stock (BA), you were very, very wrong. After weeks of constant scrutiny, the aerospace giant’s 737 MAX aircraft has suffered another brutal setback, and it sent the Dow’s largest component careening toward a five-month low. The Federal Aviation Administration triggered the latest sell-off when it revealed that more than 300 Boeing 737 planes could have faulty parts installed. The downturn weighed heavy on the embattled Dow Jones Industrial Average. By early afternoon on Monday, BA shares had dropped 1.3% to $337, up from an intraday low of $330.67 that thrust the stock to its lowest level since the first week of 2019. Boeing was the darling of Wall Street at the start of the year, enjoying record earnings. After a second disastrous crash (allied with numerous safety failings), shares now teeter more than $100 off a peak of $446 in March. As the subsequent grounding of the 737 Max 8 appears justified, so does the dip in Boeing’s stock price. With so many purchases already priced in, it is inevitable that some airlines begin to cancel orders. We have already seen the first of these, as Garuda Indonesia canceled its order in March. It is not yet clear whether these fresh revelations will trigger any new cancellations. Investors might err on the side of caution, however, and price some caution into the share price.

GoAir has emerged to stay on top of the OTP chart,"GoAir is the best ‘On-Time-Performance’ airline in India! No-frills airline GoAir has been adjudged as India’s most reliable airline as it had clocked best-on-time performance (OTP). The details regarding this were revealed by Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the company said in a statement. The OTP is a key for any passengers as it relates to arrival and departure. It becomes even more crucial as based on this a passenger can plan for connecting flight on time. GoAir has recorded the best OTP of 96.3 per cent in April 2019, according to DGCA data. This is not the first time that GoAir achieved this feat. GoAir has emerged to stay on top of the OTP chart for the 8th consecutive month. In fiscal 2018-19, GoAir achieved the best OTP for an astounding 7 out of 12 months. “The accuracy of both scheduling the service and delivering on-time performance (OTP) is incredible for airlines and airports alike. GoAir is pleased to offer a reliable travel service wherein we assure travelers to get them to their destination in a timely manner while taking into consideration factors that are not necessarily in the control of the airline like airport congestion, taxi times from the runways, gate availability, etc. as these are in the domain of air traffic control or the airport authority. Emerging at the top of the list for the 8th time successively is certainly a comforting factor for passengers and a gratifying moment for GoAir,” GoAir Managing Director Jeh Wadia said. GoAir operates over 270 daily flights and carried 11.9 lakh passengers in April 2019. GoAir is an aviation foray of the Wadia Group that has Britannia, Bombay Dyeing, Bombay Burmah, Bombay Realty and National Peroxide in its portfolio. GoAir flies to 24 domestic destinations including Ahmedabad, Bagdogra, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Goa, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jammu, Kochi, Kolkata, Kannur, Leh, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Patna, Port Blair, Pune, Ranchi and Srinagar, and 4 international destinations, including Phuket, Malé, Muscat and Abu Dhabi.

At least 20 per cent of U.S. travelers say they will definitely avoid the plane in the first six months after flight resume, according to a study led by consultant Henry Harteveldt. More than 40 per cent said they’d be willing to take pricier or less convenient flights to stay off the Max. A separate UBS Group AG survey found that 70 per cent would hesitate today to book a flight on Boeing’s best-selling jet. “Travelers aren’t merely scared of the 737 Max, they’re terrified of it,” Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, said in the report, which was released Tuesday. “The 737 Max is, for now, an ‘airplane non grata’ -- a plane passengers do not want to fly.” The surveys underscore the challenge looming for Boeing as it seeks to regain public trust after two deadly crashes and a global flying ban that’s nearing the three-month mark. Boeing is finalizing a software fix for a flight-control system malfunction linked to the accidents, as well as proposed new pilot training. Regulators in the U.S. and other countries say there’s no timeline for when the plane will resume flights. Only 14 per cent of U.S. passengers would definitely fly on a 737 Max within six months of its return, according to the online study for Atmosphere of 2,000 U.S. airline passengers from April 27 to","Jun 4, 2019",http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/boeing-737-max-seen-as-airplane-non-grata-by-wary-travelers-1.1268532

Surprise bid for Thomas Cook airlines as Portugal's largest private airline Hi Fly makes non-binding offer. RELATED ARTICLES.

comments  Portugal's largest private airline has emerged as a surprise new bidder for a chunk of beleaguered travel firm Thomas Cook. Sources told The Mail on Sunday that Hi Fly – which specialises in charter flights and leasing aircraft to other operators – has made a non-binding offer for Thomas Cook's airline business. Hi Fly was founded in 2005 and has its HQ in Lisbon and a subsidiary in Malta. Other firms to have expressed an interest include Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa and aviation investor Indigo Partners. Thomas Cook wants to sell its profitable airline division to reduce its debts Hi Fly and its competitors will need to firm up their bids in the coming weeks as Thomas Cook aims to begin considering binding offers early next month. Thomas Cook wants to sell its profitable airline division to reduce its debts. It would still be left with its larger tour operator business. The 178-year-old travel company has taken a battering on the stock exchange in recent months, due in part to pressures affecting the sector generally.  The company has blamed uncertainty surrounding Brexit for damaging consumer confidence, while a weaker pound has made foreign holidays more expensive. Last month, the firm reported a six-month loss of £1.5billion, which included a £1.1billion writedown on a business it bought more than ten years ago. Hi Fly did not respond to requests for comment. Thomas Cook shares were 2.3 per cent higher at 17.70p in morning trading. By Ben Harrington  The American owner of the Priory Group is looking into a quick sale of the controversial £1billion mental healthcare group. The MoS revealed in April that Acadia Healthcare, which bought the Priory Group in February 2016 for £1.28billion, is mulling a sale. Now Debbie Osteen – the new chief executive of Acadia – has told investors the time may have come for the company to quit Britain. She said: 'The board of directors has decided now is the right time to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the UK business. 'The board will evaluate a potential transaction expeditiously ... and while there is no guarantee a transaction will occur, we are fully committed to this process.'
