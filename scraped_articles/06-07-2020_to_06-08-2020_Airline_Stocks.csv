Sciple: Great to have you, Lou, you know, you're hopping on late notice here today, we had planned to have John Rosevear on to talk about Nikola Motor, which is officially going public today via SPAC. [Special Purpose Acquisition Company] An exciting company, they describe in their filing documents Nikola Motor is a vertically integrated zero emissions transportation solution provider that designs and manufactures state-of-the-art battery, electric and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, electric vehicle drive trains, energy storage systems and hydrogen fueling stations. So really, they want to revolutionize the logistics industry when it comes to how these vehicles are fueled. I haven't dived into this too deeply, Lou, but when you see this filing, anything pops out to you about this company? Whiteman: You know, it's a huge potential market and it's an important market. Transportation is the biggest source of greenhouse gases and heavy-duty trucks make up more than one-quarter of total transport emissions, so this is an important problem to solve. The company has high hopes, they're talking, I think, but they're not going to start producing trucks until 2023, and they hope to have 5% of the total market by 2024. They have good leadership, it's just, they've gone up against a lot of heavyweights, it's pre-revenue, they're not going to even have revenue until 2023 or so.

3,Airline stocks are rallying and earning the U.S. Treasury a $330 million profit,". . . . . . . . . This year’s Rose Bowl, one of the two CFP semifinal matchups,","  BUSINESSAIRLINES By Kyle Arnold 2:36 PM on Jun 8, 2020 CDT Airline stocks have surged in the last week after optimistic trends in travelers since Memorial Day weekend and steps by carriers to boost schedules. As much as airlines are enjoying the upswing in value, the U.S. Treasury Department may be among the biggest winners after getting concessions during stimulus negotiations that included the right to buy more than 32 million shares in publicly traded airlines at a discounted price.   By mid-day Monday, those “warrants” would net the federal government about a $330 million profit if the Treasury cashed out now. The warrants give the Treasury the right to buy stock for a price agreed to in early April, the worst period for airline traffic and stock prices. Those warrants were among the conditions airlines agreed to in order to get the cash needed to survive, along with agreements to not pay dividends or buy back shares, limits on executive pay and a prohibition from laying off or furloughing employees or cutting pay. As the stock market creeps back towards record territory thanks to a recent rally, airlines have been amongst the biggest winners after falling to historic lows during the last two months with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing carriers to fight for their financial lives. Fort Worth-based American Airlines’ stock started the year around $29 a share but fell as low as $9.04 on May 15 over concerns about high debt levels and a long road to recovery. Some analysts and industry insiders wondered if American Airlines would have to file for bankruptcy. Berkshire Hathaway, which owned about 10% of the shares in the biggest carriers, dumped all of its airline stock in late April. Researchers have proven that being helpful to others releases dopamine — the “feel-good” chemical — in our brains and lights up the same... Since then, airlines have gained strength on Wall Street as bankruptcy concerns have dwindled. On Monday, American Airlines’ stock price peaked at about $20 a share for the first time since February after reporting that it was increasing its flight schedule for July. That’s added more than $4 billion in value back to the company’s public evaluation. It’s also made the U.S. Treasury Department look like a wise investor. As part of the $5.8 billion in grants and $1.7 billion in loans given to American in April,","Jun 8, 2020",https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2020/06/08/airline-stocks-are-rallying-and-earning-the-us-treasury-a-300-million-profit/
4,"Airline stocks rally in best week ever, and chart points to more gains","After airline stocks’ best week ever, technical analyst bets on another 25% rally. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips. CNBC","Airline stocks went sky high last week. The JETS airline ETF, whose holdings include JetBlue and Southwest, rallied 33% in the past five sessions, closing out Friday with its best weekly gain on record. Airlines have rebounded as investors make bets on pent-up consumer demand. The ETF remains roughly 40% off 52-week highs. Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, sees even higher highs ahead for the group. “Take a look at the chart of JETS,” Johnson told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “You’ve got a pretty clear downtrend reversal off of those February highs. You also made a very nice-looking base, and at this point in time, the [ETF] looks like it’s poised to go back and retest its 200-day moving average, which would be around $25. So still nice upside left from here.” The JETS ETF closed Friday at $20.09. A move to $25 implies more than 24% upside.  “The relative strength [momentum indicator] versus the S&P is improving, really providing confirmation here,” said Johnson. “As we get more confirmation that there can be a vaccine and more evidence that that’s coming, these airlines are going to further take off.”  Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, cautions investors not to get bullish on the airlines.  “We believe airlines have a flawed business model. There are three issues. One, airlines run a lot of debt, they have too much debt on their balance sheet. Two, cash flow volatility is incredibly high, and three, they have high embedded infrastructure costs. So we would actually advise investors to look at other industrials,” Morganlander said during the same segment.  Two such stocks, in particular, look appealing to Morganlander. “Look at General Dynamics or Raytheon Technologies: Both of these companies are consistently growing, consistently profitable, and they don’t have a lot of debt on their balance sheet,” Marganlander said. “Those we believe you could own for three to four years.” General Dyanmics and Raytheon also rallied in the past week, albeit not as strongly as airlines’ moves. General Dynamics gained 10% and Raytheon went up 12%.  Disclosure: Washington Crossing Advisors holds GD and RTX.  Disclaimer Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

June 8, 2020  Today I’d like to start by lending my voice in support of those who seek to bring attention to and rectify the deeply rooted societal inequities that contributed to the senseless killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmed Aubrey and others. Racism has no place in America. Full stop. Many Americans understand and empathize with the outrage, even if they don’t necessarily agree with the looting and violence that have defined some of the protests. A vast majority of the demonstrators want only to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully, and it’s unfortunate when a few bad actors are allowed to hijack the protests. Like the coronavirus pandemic and economic downturn, the civil unrest has generated a lot of fear and uncertainty among Americans. But there are signs that the worst is behind us. The daily rate of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. has been marginally decreasing. And on Friday, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. added a staggering 2.5 million payrolls in May, suggesting a strong economic recovery is underway. Much work still needs to be done, but I’m equally confident a satisfactory solution to the unrest can be reached. click to enlarge President Donald Trump addressed the blowout jobs numbers in a press conference Friday, comparing the U.S. economy to a “rocket ship.” Economists had been expecting the unemployment rate to jump higher in May, possibly to as much as 20 percent, but it ended up falling last month, from 14.7 percent in April to 13.3 percent. Trump praised the domestic airline industry, saying carriers are recovering nicely with the economic reopening. On Thursday, shares of American Airlines stock exploded an unbelievable 41 percent, the most on record for a single day, after the carrier said it would increase July flights 74 percent compared with this month. Meanwhile, more and more planes are returning to the sky, with the number of parked passenger aircraft dropping below 50 percent of all fleets in the U.S., Europe and China, according to","Jun 8, 2020",http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/airline-stocks-just-posted-their-best-week-on-record/

A rebounding global economy doesn’t change that. By: Mark Emem | Email | Leave a comment This is an opinion. A modest improvement in passenger traffic has seen the major airline stocks stage a recovery from their May lows. Since May 15, the stocks of the four largest U.S. airlines have all gone up by at least 25%. American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) has appreciated by around 25%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) has surged by about 37%. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) has gone up by over 40%, while United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL) has rallied by about 50%. Retail interest in the four largest U.S. carriers has exploded on Robinhood, a commission-free investing app. The airlines are among the top-20 most popular stocks over the past month. But don’t let that fool you–airlines face a turbulent future for at least three reasons. Improving passenger traffic may signal hope for carriers, but it isn’t yet time to pop the champagne yet. Numbers are unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. To compete for the reduced number of flyers amid state reopenings, you can expect a significant price war. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly has warned employees to brace for heightened competition: We’ll compete hard for customers, understanding it will be a brutal, low-fare environment as there are far more airline seats, and there will be for some time, than there are customers.

The publication noted that the stock continued to soar Friday, gaining more than 21 percent while Spirit Airlines jumped 20 percent and United Airlines Holdings was up more than 18 percent. But Barrons also pointed out that many analysts aren’t ready to jump on board. Citi’s Stephen Trent reiterated his Sell rating, writing in an investor’s note on Thursday that “the lack of business travel puts some downside risk on price point, while ambitious load factor targets (percentage of seats filled vs. total number of seats) could create social distancing concerns.” Rising load factors are good, just not while it’s still early on here during the coronavirus pandemic which might raise concerns among passengers about social distancing. “These factors, along with the scale of American’s net leverage and pension liabilities relative to expected Ebitda generation, underpin our Sell rating on the shares,” Trent writes, referring to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Trent has a $9 price target on the stock. But CNBC believes the stock surge could continue this coming week. The network said the New York Stock Exchange Arca Airline Index was up nearly 50 percent last week, and that “airline stocks are headed for their biggest weekly gains ever on hopes for a rebound in the U.S. economy and air travel demand.” The combination of airlines increasing its summer flying capacity along with the majority of states in the U.S. starting to lift its lockdown and shelter-in-place restrictions should help the stock continue to rise.

RECOMMENDED," Home » Investor News » Airlines Stocks Are a Great Short-Term Play. Watch for These Headwinds  Posted by Chad Stone | Jun 8, 2020 | Investing 3 minute, 33 second read Investors are piling into sectors that were beaten down by the coronavirus lockdown, and some of the biggest gains over the past week have occurred in airline stocks. So is it the right time to join them? Individual airline stocks have recently started to surge off March lows as companies continue to develop a post-coronavirus plan that meets increased demand for travel. Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL
), American Airlines Group Inc. (Nasdaq: AAL
) and United Airlines Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: UAL
) were all trading at least 4% higher again Monday morning as exuberant investors continue to fuel the rally higher.  Banyan Hill’s Brian Christopher Banyan Hill Publishing’s Brian Christopher attributes a lot of this run-up to the increased demand to get out of the house after being under “stay at home” orders for so long. “People have been cooped up,” said Christopher, Editor of Profit Line. “The uptick in airline stocks is really a function of human nature. We want to get out and about. And some of us are willing to fly.” And airlines are answering the call. American Airlines announced last week it plans to fly more than 55% of its domestic flights normally scheduled in July, which is way up from 20% in May. American’s daily passengers have surged from 32,000 in April to more than 110,000 in May, according to NPR. American Airline’s stock has seen significant gains since bottoming out at $8.25 in mid-May. Shares rallied 41% Thursday after the news of increased capacity broke. If you need more proof of squirrelly consumers needing more to consume, look no further than Sin City, Christopher argues. “Las Vegas just reopened. Initial news coverage confirmed people’s desire to leave the house. We saw video of packed casinos. The more people that visit Las Vegas and the more stories they come home with, the more people will want to travel there,” Christopher explained. “That will be good for airlines.” And it won’t just be Las Vegas that sees the benefit of more consumer traffic.

Analyst Emma Young upgraded Alaska Air shares to ""buy"" and lifted its price target to $53 from $36, implying a 24% gain from Friday's close. Alaska and Southwest Airlines are well-positioned for the industry's revival from travel lockdowns due to their strong balance sheets and efficient capital structures, she wrote.  The firm also upgraded JetBlue to ""neutral"" on hopes of recovering leisure-travel demand.  Bank of America sees airlines recovering from their early-2020 slump to a 55% revenue decline from 90%. Rebounding leisure travel will certainly aid the sector, but its ""true catalyst"" for returning to past health will be the return of corporate demand, Young wrote. Until then, expect a heavier weighting of leisure interest to stifle revenues and lead firms with strong cash flow to outperform, she added.

Alaska Air soared as much as 11.8% on the news but sits 30% lower year-to-date. The company broadly outperformed other airlines in Monday's session. The bank expects Southwest and Alaska to have the smallest growth in net debt by the end of 2020. Alaska will add only 8% to its total debt over the year compared to a 40% average increase among peers, Young projected.  The industry's recovery could accelerate if a coronavirus vaccine becomes widely available, she added. The sector is anticipating a multi-year recovery before hitting 2019 demand, but a faster-than-expected treatment rollout would boost consumer comfort in traveling. Alaska joins Southwest and Allegiant as the only airlines with ""buy"" ratings from Bank of America.

14,Was Buffett Right in Selling Airline Stocks? - The Motley Fool Canada,. . . . . . . . Was Buffett Right in Selling Airline Stocks?. Airline jobs are still hanging,"      Puja Tayal | June 8, 2020 | More on: AC Warren Buffett is the most famous value investor whose investing ideas are followed by many. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Buffett had made a mistake by exiting his position in the big four U.S. airlines. Trump’s statement came as many airline stocks jumped on positive U.S. employment data and an uptick in travel demand. Stocks of American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Airlines jumped 11.18%, 8.45%, and 5.5%, respectively. Even Air Canada (TSX:AC) stock rose 4.48%. One bump in airline stocks doesn’t mean that Buffett’s decision in airline stocks was a mistake. Although the billionaire investor has made mistakes in the past, exiting airline stocks wasn’t one of them. The U.S. Labor Department reported an unexpected rise of 2.5 million jobs in May. None of these jobs came from air transportation. Instead, the sector saw 50,000 more job losses in May, following 79,000 in April. Most U.S. airlines have barred themselves from cutting jobs only because the $50 billion government bailout refrains them from doing so until September 30. Once the government money is exhausted, most airlines will shrink their fleet size and workforce to cut costs. Cowen analyst Helane Becker believes that U.S. airlines could retire 800-1,000 aircraft and cut 95,000-105,000 jobs. The number of job cuts will depend on the recovery of travel demand this summer and airlines’ liquidity against their debt. Unlike U.S. airlines, however, Air Canada did not receive any government bailout. Moreover, it has $4.2 billion in net debt, which encouraged the company to reduce its workforce by 60% and raise around $1.6 billion through shares and convertible bonds. U.S. airlines are seeing an increase in domestic travel because of the pent-up demand during the lockdown and the reopening of states. Compared to last year’s capacity, American Airlines is planning to operate at 30% and 40% capacity in June and July. United Airlines is expecting to operate at 30% of its domestic capacity in July, up from 23% in June. As airlines spend 80-90% of their revenue on operating expenses, they need to fill at least 70-80% of their seats to breakeven.

16,3 Airline Stocks To Avoid After the Recent Relief Rally | InvestorPlace,3 Airline Stocks To Avoid After the Recent Relief Rally. Airline stocks have witnessed strong rally in the recent past.," Source: Shutterstock When Warren Buffett sold his firm’s holdings in four major airline companies, he opined that “We will not fund a company… where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.” In the long-term, this may or may not hold true. However, there is little doubt on the point that airline stocks are facing one of their most challenging times, ever. Seock-Jin Hong, Ph.D., assistant professor of Aviation Logistics at the G. Brint Ryan College of Business of University of North Texas, told InvestorPlace it could be “at least 2 to 3 years” before demand returns to 2019 levels. Furthermore, Professor Hong tells us: “The number of airlines will shrink because of M&A (mergers and acquisitions) even with federal stimulus, which is not enough to sustain, and some small carriers will not survive. At the onset of Covid-19, air cargo surged because of urgent need of PPE. The air cargo price [is still] two to four times more than before the pandemic because [available cargo transport space on passenger flights] decreased to 90%. However, recently the cargo volume to/from the U.S. decreased very quickly because of … China and the Trump administration’s international trade policy.” With that in mind, here are 3 airline stocks currently at a tipping point: Headwinds for the sector are far from over, so investors need to remain cautious. YOUR FREE GUIDE TO 2021’S BEST EV STOCKS IS HERE  During the market meltdown, AAL stock touched a low of $8.25. Currently, the stock trades 79% higher at $14.80. After the big rally, however, the stock should be avoided, as I believe that a renewed correction is imminent. From a liquidity perspective, the company expects to close the second quarter of 2020 with a cash buffer of $11 billion. However, from the current month onward, the company expects a daily cash burn of $50 million. If weakness in the industry sustains, rapid cash burn would imply further leveraging or equity dilution. Last month, Lufthansa’s Turkey chief opined that the airlines industry will not recover until 2022. There are similar opinions from other CEO’s and industry experts. Therefore, even if cash burn declines going into fiscal year 2021, strong demand is unlikely to return. As balance sheet stresses increase, AAL stock will trend lower. Coming back to American Airlines in particular, the company has total contractual cash obligations of $34.3","Jun 8, 2020",https://investorplace.com/2020/06/3-airline-stocks-to-avoid-after-the-recent-relief-rally/
17,Wait for a Pullback in LUV Stock Before Diving In Again | InvestorPlace,"Wait for a Pullback in Southwest Airlines Before Diving In. With investors betting on a V-shaped airline recovery, shares may"," On the heels of an air travel bounce back, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has made an epic recovery as of late. Since May 15, shares have rallied tremendously. But, with LUV stock up more than 60% in less than a month, is it too late for investors to buy in as the stock remains below past highs?  It’s debatable. On one hand, low-cost carriers like this company may be the better airline plays out there. Not saddled with high operating costs and pension liabilities like its rivals, once passengers return to the skies, Southwest could more quickly return to profitability. On the other hand, speculation has gotten ahead of fundamentals. Investors have bid up airline stocks across the board. Investors have also piled into airline exchange-traded funds like the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA:JETS). With so many people looking to bet on a V-shaped airline recovery post-novel coronavirus, it’s no surprise this has happened. Even with just breadcrumbs of good news backing up the thesis. The question is whether results will live up to high expectations for clear skies ahead. With this in mind, it may be too late to ride the wave with LUV stock. Nevertheless, with an operating model giving them an edge, shares could be a buy on a pullback. Should you buy legacy carriers with a lot of baggage, like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)? Or should you consider financially stronger names, like Southwest? The answer is crystal clear. If you want to bet on a full airline recovery, go with quality. And that’s the situation with LUV stock. As InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth wrote June 1, this airline has a much cleaner balance sheet. Also, given this carrier’s focus on domestic routes, they have less to lose if travelers continue to shun international flights due to mask-wearing requirements and other safety protocols that make a long-haul flight less appealing. Besides these advantages, Southwest has another edge over the “old school” airlines. That would be their low-cost structure. Obviously, this has been a decades-long advantage for them. Yet, today’s enviornment could make it an even greater strength. How so? With lower operating costs, the carrier can better adapt to what CEO Gary Kelley deemed a “brutal low-fare environment” going forward. This could mean they have a better chance at returning to profitability, even as safety measures and low demand impact load factors.
