1,Why JetBlue Airways Could Be the Best Airline Stock of 2020 | The Motley Fool,Why JetBlue Airways Could Be the Best Airline Stock of 2020. Can JetBlue’s hot start in 2020 continue?. Takeaways from,"   JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) has had a hot start to the new decade. After an earnings beat last week and a competitive advantage as the only major U.S. airline that doesn't operate Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft, does JetBlue have more room to run over the long-term?  JBLU DATA BY YCHARTS There was a lot more for investors to smile about than JetBlue's slight beat on fourth-quarter earnings. The biggest positive from the report was JetBlue's first-quarter 2020 revenue per available seat mile (RASM) forecast of 0% to 3% compared to Q1 2019. RASM is a key revenue metric for airlines. JetBlue had been struggling with RASM growth, posting a 2.7% decline in Q4 2019 compared to Q4 2018. That performance was in line with expectations of a 0.5% to 3.5% decline. What makes JetBlue's positive RASM growth even more impressive is that it comes during an expectedly low-growth year according to competitors United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Another positive for JetBlue was its 6% capacity growth, which was on the higher end of guidance of 4.5% to 6.5%. Capacity growth indicates larger planes with bigger fuel tanks are being utilized to accommodate more passengers per flight. JetBlue expects capacity to rise 1.5% to 3.5% in Q1 2020 and total 2020 capacity growth to be 5.5% to 7.5%. JetBlue's anticipated capacity growth is impressive considering capacity grew 6.6% in 2019. JetBlue attributes its capacity growth to network expansion and additional seats from its cabin restyling program.  On the earnings side, JetBlue reaffirmed its forecast of $2.50 to $3 earnings per share (EPS), which it had guided for in the third quarter of 2019. At the current price, JetBlue would have a foreword P/E ratio of 6.8 to 8.1, placing it in value stock territory from a valuation perspective.  In the era of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment funds, companies that have a long-term focus on sustainability mean more than just a greener future. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), ""petroleum products accounted for about 92% of the total U.S. transportation sector energy use"" in 2018. Jet fuel made up 12% of the total fuel used in transportation. Airlines could become increasingly pressured to transition from jet fuel use in the future. JetBlue is attempting to be ahead of the curve when it comes to sustainability.

Wall Street braces for trading surge","      Stocks fell sharply on Friday, wiping out the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s gain for January, as investors grew increasingly worried about the potential economic impact of China’s fast-spreading coronavirus. The Dow dropped 610 points, or 2.1 percent, in the 30-stock average’s worst day since August. The S&P 500 was down 1.8 percent while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.6 percent. China’s National Health Commission confirmed on Friday that there have been 9,692 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with 213 deaths. On Friday, the U.S. declared the coronavirus a public health emergency within the country. Delta and American suspended all flights between China and the U.S. United Airlines announced similar measures later in the day. The World Health Organization recognized the deadly pneumonia-like virus as a global health emergency on Thursday, citing concern that the outbreak continues to spread to other countries with weaker health systems. WHO’s designation was made to help the United Nations health agency mobilize financial and political support to contain the outbreak. The virus, which was first discovered in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has now spread to at least 18 other countries and has dampened sentiment over global economic growth. “The outbreak of the coronavirus has added another headwind to the near-term outlook for stocks,” Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, said in a note. “Viruses often become less lethal as they mutate because a virus that kills its host is also a virus that kills itself. Unfortunately, in a world of mass travel, a virus can spread across the globe before it has time to lose potency.” Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, two stocks that are coronavirus proxies, given their gaming exposure in China, fell more than 1.5 percent each. Airline stocks such as American and United dropped more than 2.5 percent each, while Delta slid 2 percent. The major averages saw an uptick in volatility this month as investors grappled with rising tensions between Iran and the U.S., trade worries with China and the coronavirus scare.

We now offer the following TARGET Portfolios:. ,"We get paid only if we make money for you Our fee structure for managed portfolios is quite unique in the industry. We only charge success fee. We have eliminated the management fee completely and only pass-on to clients our direct custody and regulatory costs (usually less than 0.1%). Yes, it means that we get paid only if we make positive absolute returns on the funds you entrust us to manage. What is more, for many of our portfolios we apply the so-called hurdle-rate. We charge success fee only if the return is higher than a certain rate and only on the portion above that rate. Many fund management companies and brokers offering asset management give kick-backs to distributors for bringing them clients. This is why they tend to charge management fees as high as 3% per year, as they have to include the kick-back. This practice has been made illegal in some European countries. Unfortunately MiFID 2 stopped short of banning it across the EU. It only requires distributors and fund managers to disclose the practice to clients, which they usually do in the small-print of obscure terms and conditions. We have had many offers over the years of people telling us: ""Give me a bigger kick-back and I will bring you my clients"". Which implies the distributor owns the clients.

6,A decade of growth - Aviation Leaders Report 2020 - KPMG Ireland,. . . . . . A decade of growth. . Macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Airline fundamentals. Airlines that ceased,"The aviation industry’s famously long benign period of growth, now referred to as a “supercycle”, is slowly coming to an end. Barring any exogeneous market shocks, the industry is expecting a softer rather than a hard landing, at least for now. The aviation industry remains awash with liquidity as investors continue to search for yield as interest rates remain at ultra-low levels. However, nervousness remains. Airline bankruptcies have seen an uptick in 2019, demonstrating that airline credit risk is clearly increasing, with some airlines addressing capacity issues and reducing growth plans heading into 2020.  The market picture today is much more complex than in previous years, primarily due to the distortion caused by the grounding of the Boeing 737MAX in March 2019 with still no firm date for its return to service. Aircraft lessors are enjoying a short-term bounce in demand due to the absence of the expected MAX capacity, with airlines seeking to extend leases and secure short-term lift. The experienced lessors are keeping a sharp eye on those building headwinds to ensure they benefit from opportunities both now and once the market turns in earnest.  On a macroeconomic level, global economic growth in 2019 has been the weakest since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Global GDP growth was hovering around 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Rising trade barriers – trade wars between US and China, as well as the continuing fallout of Brexit in the UK – and the associated uncertainty has impacted business growth around the world. This has been coupled with country-specific weaknesses in large emerging market economies such as Brazil, India and Russia, as well as a stressed financial environment in Argentina, social unrest in Venezuela, and continuing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.  Trade wars and political disputes between the US and China have had a significant negative impact on the aviation industry, particularly on the air cargo market due to the slowdown in world trade. Figures from International Air Transport Association (IATA), in the December IATA Airline Industy Economic Performance report, track the impact on the airline industry. Passenger traffic growth reduced in 2019, down to 4.2% RPK growth, from 7.4% in 2018. Capacity growth was also down to 3.5% from 6.9% in 2018, which can certainly be attributed in part to the MAX impact.

7,Burn Rate Is a Key Factor in a Company's Sustainability,How Burn Rate Is a Key Factor in a Company's Sustainability. . Getting Burned by the Burn Rate. KEY TAKEAWAYS.,"Burn rate refers to the rate at which a company spends its supply of cash over time. It's the rate of negative cash flow, usually quoted as a monthly rate. In some crisis situations, the burn rate might be measured in weeks or even days. Analysis of cash consumption tells investors whether a company is self-sustaining, and signals the need for future financing. Burn rate is mainly an issue for startup companies that are typically unprofitable in their early stages and are usually in high growth industries. It may take years for a company to generate profit from its sales or revenue and as a result, will need an adequate supply of cash on hand to meet expenses. Many technology and biotech companies face years of living on their bank balances. Burn rates also apply to mature companies that are struggling and carrying excessive debt. Airline stocks, for example, faced a crisis following 9/11, which placed the largest air carriers in a cash crunch threatening the industry. United Airlines, for instance, suffered a daily cash burn of more than $7 million before seeking bankruptcy protection. If a company's cash burn continues over an extended period of time, then the company is likely operating on stockholder equity funds and borrowed capital. Investors need to pay close attention to the burn rate of cash, particularly if the company is seeking additional capital. If companies burn cash too fast, they run the risk of going out of business. On the other hand, if a company burns cash too slowly, it might be a sign that the company is not investing in its future and may fall behind the competition. An effective management team knows how to manage cash well. The burn rate is determined by looking at the cash flow statement, which reports the change in the firm's cash position from one period to the next by accounting for the cash flows from operations, investment activities, and financing activities. Compared to the amount of cash a company has on hand, the burn rate gives investors a sense of how much time is left before the company runs out of cash—assuming no change in the burn rate. If you want to know if a company is really in trouble, compare its burn rate with the working capital measured over the same time period: Let's consider the cash flows of a hypothetical company—Super Biosciences.

Healthcare stock picks from Mackie     High-flying stock Air Canada (Air Canada Stock Quote, Chart, News TSX:AC) has been down in the dumps over the past couple of weeks as it deals with a number of headwinds. Is this a sign of further trouble ahead or a momentary blip? That’s tough to say but with an economic slowdown forming, this is one stock you don’t want to be buying on the pullback, says fund manager Lorne Steinberg. Air Canada on Thursday announced t would be suspending direct flights from Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal bound to Beijing and Shanghai for one month as tensions ramp up surrounding the current coronavirus outbreak. “Air Canada regrets this situation and apologizes for the serious disruption to our customers’ travel plans,” a statement from the airline read. The new development comes as the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global emergency on Thursday, while nonetheless cautioning that keeping official border crossings between countries open is essential to containing the disease’s spread, in the main by preventing people from using irregular means of movement which may not allow for the checking of symptoms.   Outside of the serious health concerns, the coronavirus outbreak has also had an impact on stock markets worldwide, particularly for airline companies who have seen their share prices drop in recent weeks. Air Canada, which had a superb 2019 where it gained 87 per cent in value, started off 2020 on an uptick but is now down eight per cent for January. The downturn might be tempting for those investors who feel like they’ve missed out on AC’s past success, but Steinberg says that the macro-winds are blowing against Air Canada and the rest of the stocks in the sector. “Of all the industries, airlines are among the most economically sensitive, so with the economy slowing, we would not be a buyer of any airline stock,” said Steinberg, president of Lorne Steinberg Wealth Management, who spoke to BNN Bloomberg on Thursday. “Air Canada has been spectacularly run and it has had an amazing ten-year run and [CEO Calin Rovinescu] has done a great job. But looking at the chart, even, the opportunity has been missed and we would pass,” he said.

More must-read stories from Fortune:","January 31, 2020 9:51 PM GMT+2      U.S. airlines are halting China service because of health concerns from the coronavirus outbreak, shutting down flights between the world’s two largest economies. American Airlines Group Inc. said Friday it would cease flights Jan. 31, a day after the U.S. government warned people not to travel to China. Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. will operate their last service, which will be return flights from China, on Feb. 5. United and American will continue to fly to Hong Kong. The shutdown of air links between the U.S. and China is deepening the disruption from the coronavirus, which has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization. The halt of flights connecting the U.S. with Beijing and Shanghai underscores the rising concern, since both cities are hundreds of miles from the focus of the outbreak around Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province. European carriers including British Airways, Air France and Deutsche Lufthansa AG had already announced plans to stop flying to China. American said it would work to reaccommodate passengers after the immediate halt to service to Beijing and Shanghai. Delta said operating flights for the next few days would give customers looking to leave China a way to do so. The airline's suspension will last through April, while the halt at American and United will last until late March. —Global companies enter lockdown mode as coronavirus rocks China

Share this story. . This,"Three major US airlines are suspending all flights to and from mainland China.  Update: March 5, 2020: This story contains information that is no longer timely. For news on how the Covid-19 outbreak is affecting US airlines, read the latest here. American, Delta, and United Airlines will temporarily suspend all flights to mainland China in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak. The decision comes days after most major carriers announced reduced service to China; American will stop flights immediately through March 27, while Delta and United will suspend service starting on February 6. Earlier this week, all three major carriers have waived change and cancellation fees for China-bound travelers through the end of February. American’s suspension will last through March 27, United expects to resume service by March 28, and Delta by April 30, according to the New York Times. As of January 30, at least 9,776 have contracted cases of 2019-nCoV, a respiratory illness that originated in Wuhan, China. There are currently five cases of coronavirus in the US from patients who’d recently traveled to Wuhan. On Tuesday, the White House reportedly warned airlines that it might ban all China-US flights if the disease becomes a bigger public health threat in the United States, according to the Washington Post. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also expanded its travel warning Tuesday, recommending that Americans “avoid all nonessential travel” to China. The majority of coronavirus cases and deaths are occurring in mainland China, but infections have been confirmed in at least a dozen other countries, including the US, Canada, France, Germany, and South Korea. Vox’s Julia Belluz writes, “Less than four weeks into the outbreak, fear about how bad this could get is spreading faster than the virus. ... People are buying face masks. Markets are on edge. Cities and countries are responding with mass quarantines and travel bans.” Given the global concern surrounding the outbreak, the demand for travel to mainland China has declined considerably, according to US airlines. Several China-based online travel agencies and American hotel chains, like Marriott and Hilton, are also offering free cancellations or changes to bookings. In completely halting service, Delta and American are following in the footsteps of many of their international counterparts: British Airways has stopped all of its flights to China, as did Air India, Indonesia’s Lion Air, and South Korea’s Seoul Air.

15,"Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) - Overview, Diversification",Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). What is the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)?. Diversification. Does Diversification Eliminate Risk?. Portfolio Frontier. Expected Return.,"The Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) refers to an investment theory that allows investors to assemble an asset portfolio that maximizes expected return for a given level of risk. The theory assumes that investors are risk-averse; for a given level of expected return, investors will always prefer the less risky portfolio.      Hence, according to the Modern Portfolio Theory, an investor must be compensated for a higher level of risk through higher expected returns. MPT employs the core idea of diversification – owning a portfolio of assets from different classes is less risky than holding a portfolio of similar assets.   Diversification is a portfolio allocation strategy that aims to minimize idiosyncratic risk by holding assets that are not perfectly positively correlated. Correlation is simply the relationship that two variables share, and it is measured using the correlation coefficient, which lies between -1≤ρ≤1.   A perfect positive correlation between assets within a portfolio increases the standard deviation/risk of the portfolio. Diversification reduces idiosyncratic risk by holding a portfolio of assets that are not perfectly positively correlated. For example, suppose a portfolio consists of assets A and B. The correlation coefficient for A and B is -0.9. The figure shows a strong negative correlation – a loss in A is likely to be offset by a gain in B. It is the advantage of owning a diversified portfolio.     Portfolios can be diversified in a multitude of ways. Assets can be from different industries, different asset classes, different markets (i.e., countries), and of different risk levels. The key to a diversified portfolio is holding assets that are not perfectly positively correlated.   According to the Modern Portfolio Theory, a portfolio frontier, also known as an efficient frontier, is a set of portfolios that maximizes expected returns for each level of standard deviation (risk). A typical portfolio frontier is illustrated below:      The expected return of a portfolio is the expected value of the probability distribution of the possible returns it can provide to investors. Consider an investor holds a portfolio with $4,000 invested in Asset Z and $1,000 invested in Asset Y.  The expected return on Z is 10% ,and the expected return on Y is 3%. The expected return of the portfolio is: Expected Return = [($4,000/$5,000) * 10%] + [($1,000/$5,000) * 3%] = [0.8 *","Jan 31, 2020",https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/modern-portfolio-theory-mpt/
