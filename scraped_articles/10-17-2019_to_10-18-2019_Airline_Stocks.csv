0,How the Short Sellers Flubbed Their Bets Against Airlines  | Barron's,How the Short Sellers Flubbed Their Bets Against Airlines. BARRON'S NEWSLETTERS. Review & Preview. A grounded American Airlines Boeing 737,"  Every weekday evening we highlight the consequential market news of the day and explain what's likely to matter tomorrow.  Short-interest data shows that even pros get it wrong
sometimes.  Bearish bets made against U.S. airlines
after the worldwide grounding of Boeing’s (ticker: BA) 737 MAX jet haven’t worked out as expected. In fact, short sellers, or “shorts,” in industry parlance, have lost money on the trade—overall, about $80 million since the MAX grounding.  What went wrong? The pattern of short selling appears inconsistent with what actually happened to the industry
after the MAX was barred from the skies: Airlines that flew the MAX were hurt, and airlines that didn’t benefited, but short sellers increased their bearish bets against almost every airline, regardless of fleet composition.  Shorting stocks—selling borrowed shares in advance of an expected price decline—is usually the purview of hedge funds populated by sophisticated traders and investors who conduct detailed research before making bearish bets. Barron’s wants to know your thoughts on the market, the economy, and the political landscape. Results will be published at the end of October along with findings of our fall 2019 Big Money Poll of institutional investors. Take the Barron’s reader poll here.  Doing the homework is important because shorting stocks is risky. Potential losses are unlimited, while potential gains have a ceiling. While a shorted stock, in theory, can only go to zero, owing a stock can mean earning multiples of initial investments over the long run. Consider: There are 33 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index up more than 100% over the past year. Short selling has an inherent “asymmetric” risk profile—investors can lose more money than they make. The shorts added about $430 million in bearish bets against the airlines after the MAX was grounded in mid-March
, according to industry data provider S3 Analytics.  In some cases, the bears were right. American Airlines Group (AAL) flies 24 MAX jets, and Boeing’s problems hurt the company, according to Chief Financial Officer David Kerr. More American stock was sold short after the grounding, and the stock is down about 12%, underperforming peers. But short sellers also added—a lot—to bearish bets against Delta Air Lines (DAL) after the grounding. Delta doesn’t fly the MAX, and its stock is up 8% since the grounding. The airline has, in small part, actually benefited from other airlines’ capacity woes.

2,Correlation Investing: What It Is and How to Find Trades,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Correlation Investing: What It,"The College Investor Millennial Personal Finance and Investing Updated: October 17, 2019 By Jonathan Yates    No matter what, every individual has a unique insight into an industry that is useful for investing for profit. If you are a shoe freak and see a certain brand selling well from Nike (NYSE: NKE) and know that those from Crocs (NASDAQ: CROX) are no longer the rage, then gains can be made from going long on Nike and going short on Crocs. Insight like that can also result in profits from correlation investing, too. From Investopedia, “correlation” is defined: “In the world of finance, a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other. Correlations are used in advanced portfolio management.” Correlation buying and selling has a role in every portfolio, no matter how advanced the investor. As an example, if the price of oil rises, then the price of publicly-traded airline stocks will fall. The reason for this is simple: fuel costs are more than 40 percent of an airline’s expenses. When the price of oil goes up, the share price for airlines stocks go down. For an easy correlation trade, investors could buy shares of the exchange-traded fund for oil, United States Oil (NYSE: USO), when the price of crude rises. At the same time, shares of the exchange-traded fund for the airline sector, Guggenheim Airlines (NYSE: FAA), could be shorted. The same can be done with individual stocks in each sector, too, such as ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), United Continental (NYSE: UAL), and many others. When going short, it is best to pick the weakest stock in the sector. It is the same with going long. Those are the ones that will benefit most from the prevailing trends in the industry group. Exchange-traded funds such as United States Oil and Guggenheim Airlines offer the benefit of a wide range of assets. That diversity protects against the fluctuations that can result from the events of a single company. Professionals also do the research and buying and selling for exchange-traded funds, too. There are a number of ways to utilize correlation investing to profit.  It is always a useful exercise for an investor to come up with their own ideas. That maximizes the skill set and knowledge base of every individual investor. For professional help, there are a number","Oct 17, 2019",https://thecollegeinvestor.com/11669/profit-from-correlation-investing/

Qantas Airways Is Flying High On Capital Gains, Pushes Envelope With Longest Non-Stop Flight (ASX:QAN). NED PIPLOVIC. Dividends.","Welcome to the newly redesigned StockInvestor.com - The Go-To Resource For Investing Advice And Information October 17, 2019 @ 2:30 pm While Qantas Airways has built a reputation as one of the best and safest airlines for passenger travel, its stock might offer additional benefits to investors who are interested in asset appreciation alongside a steady dividend income. In travel sites and publications, Qantas Airways constantly ranks among the best airlines in the world. Additionally, the airline’s well-known safety record was even immortalized by Dustin Hoffman Academy Award-winning portrayal of the character Raymond Babbitt in the 1988 film “Rain Man”. When asked which airline is the safest, Raymond responded, “Qantas. Qantas never crashed.” While this is not completely true since the airline had some problems in its early years, the statement has held true since 1951. Similar to its safety record, Qantas Airways’ financial performance is soaring after experiencing some turbulence in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Consequently, the company’s share price dropped nearly 75% between late 2017 and February 2009. The share price continued its slide before reaching its all-time low of $0.70 (AU$1.03) in June 2012. This was a total loss of 83% from its pre-crisis level. In addition to a significant share price drop, Qantas Airways also suspended its dividend distributions for seven years starting in 2009. However, since shedding all of the negative effects of the 2008 crisis, Qantas Airways seems to be holding onto steady climb and has not reached cruising altitude yet. Qantas Airways is currently testing the potential for offering unique services through flying several of the longest non-stop flight routes, such as New York to Sydney and London to Sydney. In addition to expanding its passenger service offerings, Qantas Airways also continues to expand its revenue base through its Cargo division. Qantas’ latest addition is an agreement to manage the cargo capacity for Singapore-based Jetstar Asia across 23 stations in 13 markets.     Qantas ended a seven-year income drought for its shareholders when the company reintroduced dividend distributions in late 2015. The company distributes its dividend payouts in two installments. In March or April, the company pays an interim dividend distribution based on year-to-date operational and financial performance results and the company’s estimates for the remainder of the fiscal year. At the end of Qantas’ fiscal year, June 30, the company looks at their full-year results and","Oct 17, 2019",https://www.stockinvestor.com/44808/qantas-airways-is-flying-high-on-capital-gains-pushes-envelope-with-longest-non-stop-flight-asxqan/
4,"Consumer staples stocks: Best run in decades, but may be 'stretched'","Consumer staples stocks are having best year in decades, but valuations may be ‘stretched’. MORE IN TRADING NATION. News Tips.","It’s a party in the pantry. A handful of top consumer staples stocks are having a banner year, with better year-to-date gains in 2019 than they’ve seen for decades. They include: That doesn’t mean they’re necessarily buys, warns Nancy Tengler, chief equity strategist at Tengler Wealth Management. “I do think there are better places to be in the market,” she told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday. “These valuations are pretty stretched.” Tengler said that while she doesn’t believe September’s unexpected drop in retail sales “is indicative of a weakening consumer,” a number of the stocks behind consumer-facing companies appear to have lofty valuations. “One month of retail sales numbers doesn’t have me concerned. We think the consumer is in great shape for all the obvious reasons: interest rates, employment, gas prices are tame,” the strategist said. “But we do think some of the consumer stocks are overvalued.” Having pounded the table on stocks such as Costco when the stock market rolled over at the end of 2018, Tengler said her firm has decided it’s time to reposition. “We’ve been selling a lot of those names. We exited Costco last week on a valuation basis. It’s just too overdone for us,” she said. “We do still hold PepsiCo, but we’ve trimmed Apple, which I think is kind of consumer-y. We’ve also trimmed Starbucks, Home Depot, Procter & Gamble, and we’re still holding onto things like Walmart.” Walmart also caught the eye of Todd Gordon, longtime trader and founder of TradingAnalysis.com, who flagged the stock’s “beautiful” uptrend in the same “Trading Nation” interview.  “Ninety-five to 100 is your support level,” he said, noting that he’d recommend adding to a position in Walmart as the stock heads higher. “I think Walmart is showing good strength within [the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund, or] XLP.” While Gordon said staples stocks were broadly overvalued, he maintained his bullish take on one high-flying name. “One stock that I do like is Costco. I continue to hold it in my portfolio simply because it’s working,” he said, pointing to the stock’s neat uptrend since the end of last year.  “You really can’t dump it until it gets below about 250,” he said, adding that he’d also boost his Costco position if the stock were to break out to the upside. “But ... once it gets overvalued into resistance, I’m going to look to scale","Oct 18, 2019",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/18/consumer-staples-stock-best-run-in-decades-but-may-be-stretched.html

6,IndiGo: India’s Largest Airline Is The Best Performer Among Asia-Pacific Peers,. . . . . . . . . . . . . BloombergQuint. India’s Largest Airline Is The Best,"IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., is the best performer among Asia-Pacific airlines, aided by market share gains, a rise in profit and decline in crude prices. Shares of India’s largest airline have surged more than 100 percent in one year, nearly three times the gains in Shanghai-based low-cost airline Spring Airlines Company Ltd., or the second-best performer on the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index. SpiceJet Ltd., which is not part of the index—a 15-member gauge of airline stocks in the Asia-Pacific region—has gained about 69 percent during the year, Bloomberg data showed. IndiGo shares rallied as the company reported a threefold jump in its Ebitdar (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and rental cost) in the quarter ended June, driven by an increase in airfares after Jet Airways (India) Ltd. was grounded, faster passenger growth and adoption of a new accounting standard. The grounding of Jet Airways also helped IndiGo gain market share. And that came even as IndiGo’s promoters are engaged in a bitter boardroom battle.

On 20-hour flight, lights will be bright and food will be","    Oct 18, 2019  Angus Whitley, Bloomberg News Qantas Airways Ltd. will ditch the traditional in-flight service routine for this weekend’s marathon nonstop trip from New York to Sydney. At almost 20 hours, the unprecedented journey is set to be the world’s longest flight. It’s a key test run as Qantas prepares to start direct commercial services connecting Sydney with New York and London as soon as 2022. As part of research aimed at reducing jet lag, passengers on board will effectively switch to Sydney time as soon as they leave New York late Friday. Rather than following the standard practice of serving food and dimming the lights after takeoff, Qantas plans to keep everyone awake for six hours. They’ll be helped by food containing hot peppers and spices. “The passenger research will test alternatives to how airlines have managed in-flight service for decades,” Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said. The industry’s traditional schedule may not be the best way to switch the body clock to the destination’s time zone, he said.  Flipping the Routine Qantas’s Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner will carry only about 50 passengers and crew to give the plane the range to reach Sydney on Sunday without stopping. Here are some key features of research that will be carried out on board. Six Qantas frequent flyers will follow a pre-planned schedule for eating, drinking, sleeping and moving
They’ll keep a daily log before and during the flight, as well as for two weeks afterward to gauge how they feel
Pilots will wear brain-monitoring equipment to assess their alertness and will provide urine samples to track melatonin levels (a natural sleep-inducing chemical) Going the Distance Airlines have greater opportunity to travel long distances as advances in aviation lead to lighter aircraft that are more aerodynamic and fuel efficient. Other ultra-long-haulers include Singapore Airlines Ltd., which has resumed nonstop flights from its home base to New York, and Qatar Airways, which offers an 18-hour direct trip from Auckland to Doha. There’s a market for premium, nonstop flights between Sydney and New York, Joyce said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. He said Qantas fills its daily services from Australia’s east coast to Los Angeles, which then go onto New York. The airline also charges a premium for its 17-hour direct connection between Perth and London, and those planes are 95% full, he said. “We know","Oct 18, 2019",https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/on-20-hour-flight-lights-will-be-bright-and-food-will-be-zesty-1.1332962

USD/JPY.,"                                                   Learning how to handle stock market corrections. It's easy to get scared when the stock market is falling, but stock market corrections are as natural as physics -- what goes up must come down. Philip Malakoff, director of research at First Long Island Investors, says long-term investors should expect that these will happen on a somewhat regular basis. ""There are corrections and it's actually quite healthy for the market when they occur,"" he says. ""Of course doesn't feel good and when you're going through it."" Terms like stock market corrections, bear markets and crashes are often used as synonyms for stock market declines but mean different things. Understanding those differences can prevent investors from making impulsive decisions that can harm future returns, market watchers say. Three types of declines. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, says there are three types of stock market corrections: pullbacks, in which losses range between 5% to 10%; corrections, sell-offs of 10% to 20%; and bear markets, with losses of 20% or greater. According to Stovall's research, from December 1945 through September 2019 the S&P 500 had 58 pullbacks in bull markets, with an average decline of 7%. He found that there were 23 corrections and 12 bear markets, of which nine bear markets were ""garden variety"" drops between 20% to 40%. Three were ""mega-meltdowns"" of 40% or more, including the Great Recession, he says. In his tally, Stovall says he doesn't count pullbacks in bear markets. ""That's double counting,"" he says. Any declines between zero and 5% are just noise, he adds. Rebounds happen quicker in smaller declines. The number of months stocks decline in the more common pullbacks and corrections are about equal to the number of months it takes for the market to recover to where it was, Stovall says. Pullbacks from peak to trough declines last about a month and it takes about 1.5 months to recover to break even, he says. Corrections last about four months and completely recover in about four months.

By: Sam Bourgi | Email | Leave a comment Shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) plunged on Friday amid reports the consumer healthcare company had recalled some of its baby powder after government testing found traces of asbestos in one of the bottles. Already bogged down by thousands of lawsuits tied to its leading baby powder product, Johnson & Johnson confirmed on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found tiny amounts of asbestos in one bottle purchased online. The company says it’s investigating whether the bottle originated from one of its warehouses. Nevertheless, it has already recalled a lot containing 33,000 units of the product. Despite the ongoing lawsuits levied at JNJ, Friday’s discovery marked the first time the company had recalled its baby powder due to asbestos concerns. The known carcinogen has been linked to cancers and other illnesses. A single testing of JNJ baby powder last month found no asbestos in the product. Since 2003, Johnson’s baby powder sold in the United States has come from a Chinese supplier linked to Paris-based Imerys AIMPT.PA. As Reuters reports, the company has known for decades that miniscule amounts of asbestos were found in its talc, a clay mineral used to create baby powder. Johnson’s stock price plunged by as much as 5.5% on Friday, reaching the lowest level in three weeks. At its lowest point, JNJ traded at $128.74. The stock has a total market capitalization of $340.7 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the Dow Jones","Oct 18, 2019",https://www.ccn.com/johnson-johnson-jnj-stock-crashes-fda-asbestos/

Bhatia had filed the case in courts in the US earlier this week, according to news reports. Bhatia and Gangwal are the co-promoters of low-cost airline IndiGo who have been engaged in a public war of words for a while now.

These and various other issues were addressed at the airline’s AGM earlier this year. IndusLaw’s Jajoo thinks the issue before the US courts (Maryland) seems to revolve around Khanna, who, according to Bhatia and InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE ) group, has been acting in concert with Gangwal. Corporate lawyers also feel that the proceedings in Maryland appear to have been started to retrieve communications between Khanna and Gangwal in support of the ongoing arbitration at the London Court of International Arbitration. The arbitration was initiated by Bhatia alleging breach of a shareholders’ agreement dated April 23, 2015, which was amended on September 17, 2015, and for causing wrongful losses. The Maryland court has allowed the request for retrieval of documents by issuing a subpoena to Khanna to produce them, and also to allow the inspection of his premises. Jajoo said the rationale behind filing the proceedings in the US court could lie in jurisdictional constraints. “As Khanna is a resident of Maryland, the courts of the UK where the arbitration proceedings are on-going do not have jurisdiction over issues such as issuing a subpoena,” he said.

16,Qatar Airways Says May Convert Orders For Boeing 777-8 Jet To 777-9,. Qatar Airways says may convert orders for Boeing 777-8 jet to 777-9. Emirates and Qatar Airways are the only,"                                           Qatar Airways said it may convert its 10 orders for the Boeing Co ultra-long-range 777-8 widebody jet to the larger 777-9, depending on the performance of the 777-9. ""If the 9 is performing very close to the parameters that the 8 will operate, yes we may convert the 8 to 9,"" Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker told Reuters on the sidelines of an event to launch a new route from Doha to Langkawi. Emirates and Qatar Airways are the only firm customers for the 777-8 model, which Boeing is also trying to sell to Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd for record-long commercial flights from Sydney to London. The date of entry into service for the 777-8 will depend partly on customer demand, a Boeing executive said on Wednesday, after the US manufacturer in August said plans for first deliveries in 2022 would be delayed. The 777-9 is due to make its first test flight in 2020. Qatar Airways also has 50 777-9s on order and will maintain 60 orders for the 777X family in total even if it converts some to the larger model, al-Baker said.
